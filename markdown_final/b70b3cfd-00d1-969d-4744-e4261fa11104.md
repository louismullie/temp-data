Increased TGS

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about increased triglycerides (TGs), including definitions, mechanisms, risk, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define hypertriglyceridemia and its severity thresholds. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, distinguishing hepatic versus intestinal sources and the role of remnants. Next, I will assess cardiovascular risk, including residual risk and pancreatitis. After that, I need to check guideline-based management, including lifestyle, secondary causes, and pharmacotherapy. Finally, I will consider special populations and monitoring, and I will double-check areas where evidence is evolving or controversial, such as TG-lowering and outcomes and the use of non-HDL-C versus apoB in hypertriglyceridemia.

> Let me first confirm the definition and severity cut points. Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, with 150–199 mg/dL considered borderline high, 200–499 mg/dL high, and ≥ 500 mg/dL very high, which carries increased risk of acute pancreatitis and mandates aggressive management; I should double-check that these thresholds align with contemporary guidance, and yes, they are consistent with endocrine and lipid society statements and reviews [^9e5c0365] [^1141078f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms; I need to check the dual origins of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Hepatic VLDL production rises with insulin resistance, excess free fatty acids, and de novo lipogenesis, while intestinal chylomicron production increases postprandially and is amplified by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia; remnants from both pathways persist when clearance is impaired, and these remnants are cholesterol-enriched and atherogenic, so the biology is not just "TG per se" but the particles carrying TG and cholesterol [^3a69e010] [^05b505c2] [^31defd0a].

> Wait, let me verify the clearance bottleneck. LPL activity is inhibited by apoC-III and angiopoietin-like proteins, and clearance becomes saturated when TG levels are very high, explaining why chylomicronemia emerges and persists in severe hypertriglyceridemia; this saturation phenomenon is clinically important for diet and drug choices in severe HTG [^e94c66b1] [^f9550eb4].

> I should confirm the cardiovascular risk signal. Observational and genetic data link elevated TG and TRL remnants with increased ASCVD risk even when LDL-C is controlled, and TRL/remnant particles may be more atherogenic per particle than LDL; however, I need to be cautious because TG-lowering trials have not uniformly shown event reduction, so causality is supported by genetics and mechanistic studies but not fully proven by randomized outcomes trials across all TG ranges [^bc9b38fe] [^6b60855b] [^6fad0888].

> But wait, what if the risk is not just coronary disease? I should double-check broader vascular outcomes. Elevated TG and TRL-C associate with myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease, and in statin-treated patients, higher TRL-C predicts recurrent events independent of inflammation, reinforcing the concept of residual atherogenic risk beyond LDL-C [^952b4a05] [^e50f9428].

> Next, I should review pancreatitis risk, because this is a key clinical inflection point. Risk rises progressively as TG increase, with substantial risk above 500 mg/dL and markedly higher above 1000 mg/dL; I initially thought the pancreatitis threshold was uniformly 1000 mg/dL, but wait, I should correct that — guidelines emphasize that risk escalates from 500 mg/dL and becomes very high at 1000 mg/dL, prompting immediate dietary fat restriction and TG-lowering therapy to prevent acute pancreatitis [^1141078f] [^9e5c0365].

> Let me consider management principles, starting with lifestyle. I need to ensure I anchor on weight loss, aerobic exercise, alcohol avoidance, and dietary pattern shifts: even modest weight loss lowers TG, regular endurance exercise reduces TG for 24–48 hours, alcohol abstinence is essential in severe HTG, and replacing refined carbs with fiber and omega-3s while limiting added sugars and trans fats improves TG and the atherogenic lipid profile; these measures are first-line across severities [^41467b55] [^6402661e] [^88f453f8] [^e94c66b1].

> I should confirm secondary cause evaluation and treatment, because missing these undermines therapy. Common drivers include uncontrolled diabetes, obesity/insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and medications such as estrogens, tamoxifen, corticosteroids, and retinoids; addressing these can substantially lower TG and improve response to lipid-directed therapy [^9e5c0365] [^1fd8b182] [^a216e324].

> Now, pharmacotherapy by severity. For mild-to-moderate HTG (150–499 mg/dL), statins remain first-line for ASCVD risk reduction, with modest TG lowering; if TG persist ≥ 200 mg/dL despite statins and lifestyle, adding EPA-only at 4 g/day reduces TG and MACE in high-risk patients, whereas EPA+DHA combinations lower TG but have less robust outcome data; I should double-check that REDUCE-IT supports EPA-only for outcomes, and yes, it does [^5c8cc94c] [^9b4c64fe].

> For severe HTG (≥ 500 mg/dL), I need to ensure I prioritize pancreatitis prevention. Immediate very-low-fat diet (< 15–20 g/day), alcohol abstinence, and initiation of TG-lowering therapy are indicated; fibrates, high-dose omega-3s, and niacin are options, with fibrates often achieving 30–50% TG reduction; I should confirm that outcome data for fibrates are mixed and that selection should be individualized, which is consistent with guideline nuance [^1141078f] [^9e5c0365].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of non-HDL-C and apoB in hypertriglyceridemia. Because non-HDL-C captures TRL-C plus LDL-C, it is a better risk marker than LDL-C when TG are elevated, but it can overestimate particle number in severe HTG; apoB more directly reflects atherogenic particle count and may be preferred for risk assessment and treatment decisions in this setting, especially when non-HDL-C and apoB diverge [^7f5032d4] [^7793201b].

> Let me think about special populations. In diabetes, mixed dyslipidemia with high TG and low HDL is common and contributes to residual risk; intensifying statins, adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to lower apoB/non-HDL-C, and considering EPA-only for TG ≥ 150 mg/dL in high-risk patients are reasonable steps, acknowledging that some agents have limited TG-specific outcome data in diabetics [^90e21c5f] [^8413ec2a] [^5c8cc94c].

> In women of reproductive potential, I should confirm that oral estrogens can worsen TG and that transdermal formulations are preferred if hormone therapy is needed; pregnancy can precipitate severe HTG and pancreatitis, so management is conservative with dietary fat restriction and avoidance of TG-raising agents, with close maternal-fetal monitoring [^a216e324] [^27934fbb].

> For monitoring, I need to ensure I track fasting TG when feasible, recognize that nonfasting TG also predict risk, and consider non-HDL-C or apoB to gauge residual atherogenic burden; repeating lipids 4–12 weeks after lifestyle or drug changes is reasonable, and in severe HTG, I should monitor for pancreatitis symptoms and lactescent serum [^7f5032d4] [^9e5c0365].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also address the evolving evidence gap. While genetic and observational data support a causal role for TRL remnants in ASCVD, definitive randomized outcome trials of TG-lowering beyond statins are limited; REDUCE-IT with EPA-only is a notable exception, and ongoing trials may clarify the role of targeting apoC-III, ANGPTL3, and other pathways, so I should communicate uncertainty while aligning with current guideline-supported options [^bc9b38fe] [^5c8cc94c].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined approach: define severity, identify secondary causes, implement lifestyle therapy for all, use statins for ASCVD risk, add EPA-only for high-risk patients with persistent TG ≥ 200 mg/dL, and escalate to fibrates or other agents for severe HTG with pancreatitis risk, while leveraging non-HDL-C and apoB to guide residual risk reduction and individualizing therapy to comorbidities and patient preferences [^9e5c0365] [^1141078f] [^7f5032d4].

Increased triglycerides (TGs) are defined as fasting TG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) [^9e5c0365] and are driven by **overproduction of VLDL** [^3a69e010], impaired clearance of TRL remnants [^31defd0a], and secondary factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, alcohol, and certain medications [^4a932d65]. Elevated TGs are a **marker of atherogenic TRL remnants** [^bc9b38fe] that increase ASCVD risk even when LDL-C is controlled [^7b610499], and they also raise pancreatitis risk when ≥ 500 mg/dL [^1141078f]. Management centers on **lifestyle change** (weight loss, reduced refined carbs, alcohol restriction, omega-3s) [^88f453f8] [^5c8cc94c], control of secondary causes, and pharmacotherapy (statins, fibrates, omega-3s, or niacin) for persistent elevations or high-risk patients [^9b4c64fe] [^5c8cc94c].

---

## Definition and classification

Hypertriglyceridemia is classified by fasting TG levels:

| **Category** | **Fasting tg level (mg/dl)** |
|-|-|
| Normal | < 150 |
| Borderline high | 150–199 |
| High | 200–499 |
| Very high | ≥ 500 |

---

## Pathophysiology

Increased TGs reflect **altered lipoprotein metabolism**:

- **Overproduction**: Hepatic VLDL synthesis rises with insulin resistance, obesity, and high refined-carb intake [^3a69e010].
- **Impaired clearance**: Reduced LPL activity and apoC-III overexpression slow TRL clearance, increasing remnant particles [^31defd0a].
- **Secondary factors**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, alcohol, and medications (e.g. corticosteroids, estrogens) contribute [^4a932d65] [^1fd8b182].

---

## Clinical significance

### Cardiovascular risk

Elevated TGs are a **marker of atherogenic TRL remnants** [^bc9b38fe] that increase ASCVD risk independent of LDL-C [^6b60855b]. Risk is highest with **persistent TG ≥ 150 mg/dL**, especially in metabolic syndrome or diabetes [^5e52f062].

---

### Pancreatitis risk

Pancreatitis risk rises substantially when **TG ≥ 500 mg/dL** and is highest when **TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL** [^1141078f]; acute pancreatitis can be life-threatening.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm fasting TG**: Repeat after 8–12 hours fasting to confirm elevation [^notfound].
- **Identify secondary causes**: Screen for diabetes, obesity, alcohol use, medications, and endocrine disorders [^4a932d65].
- **Genetic testing**: Consider in severe or familial cases (e.g. LPL, APOC3, APOA5) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Weight loss**: 5–10% weight loss lowers TG by ~20% [^41467b55].
- **Diet**: Reduce refined carbs, added sugars, and alcohol; increase omega-3 intake (1–4 g/day) [^88f453f8] [^5c8cc94c].
- **Exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate activity improves clearance [^6402661e].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **Statins**: First-line for ASCVD risk; modest TG reduction (~15–30%) [^9b4c64fe].
- **Fibrates**: Preferred for TG ≥ 500 mg/dL; 30–50% reduction [^notfound].
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: 2–4 g/day reduces TG by 20–45% [^5c8cc94c].
- **Niacin**: 1–3 g/day; 20–30% reduction, but limited by side effects [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Recheck **fasting lipids** 4–12 weeks after interventions, then every 3–12 months. In severe hypertriglyceridemia, monitor for pancreatitis with symptom assessment and periodic TG checks [^notfound].

---

Increased TGs reflect **TRL overproduction and impaired clearance** [^3a69e010] and confer **ASCVD and pancreatitis risks** [^bc9b38fe] [^1141078f]. Management emphasizes lifestyle change, secondary-cause control, and targeted pharmacotherapy, with monitoring to reduce complications.

What is the evidence for a causal role of elevated triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and their remnants and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease?

The EAS Consensus Panel considers that for an interpretation of causality, five types of evidence should each favour causality (Table 5) with consistent evidence required from all three types of clinical evidence (epidemiology, genetics, and intervention trials). For elevated LDL-C, the consensus is definite causality. The Panel contends, on the basis of available evidence, that elevated TRL and their remnants combined with low HDL-C may also play a causal role in premature atherosclerosis, whereas insufficient data are currently available for assessing the causality of TRL and remnants alone. The clinical relevance of isolated low HDL-C to CVD also remains unclear.

Introduction

For decades, triglycerides (TG) have been considered a putative risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite mounting evidence from population and genetic studies, controversy persists. Much of this relates to two key questions: first, which is the culprit(s): TG molecules per se, TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), or TRL remnants, and second, for TRL or their remnants, which components give rise to risk: cholesterol contained in these particles, other features, or both? Answers are essential to understand better the pathological consequences of raised TG levels, especially in the context of residual cardiovascular risk when other major factors, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are optimally controlled. This statement aims to define what is known about the structure, function, metabolism, and atherogenicity of TRL and their remnants, and importantly, to identify targeted therapeutic approaches to address residual risk associated with elevated TG levels.

Available and novel therapies that target TG metabolism can reduce TRL plasma concentration but need to be evaluated individually for impact on atherogenic lipoproteins. Baseline TG level (fasting or non-fasting), as a reflection of the underlying metabolic abnormality (Figure 6), as well as concomitant medications, especially LDL-lowering drugs, may also influence the potential impact of any therapy on ASCVD outcomes. For example, fibrates effectively lower TG across the range of TG levels but only modestly reduce apoB levels. Their effects on LDL-C differ between moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (LDL-C is decreased or shows no change) and severe hypertriglyceridaemia (LDL-C is increased, albeit from a low baseline level).

Guideline-recommended first steps for managing hypertriglyceridaemia are diet modification and weight loss. Dietary goals include (i) avoiding highly refined carbohydrate foods;, (ii) incorporating seafood, particularly fatty fish;(iii) increasing fibre-rich foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains);(iv) avoiding excess alcohol; and (v) substituting mono- and polyunsaturated fat (mostly from plant oils and nuts) for animal fat (meat and dairy). Dietary trans FA increase TG levels minimally but should be avoided because they significantly raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C. Energy intake should be adjusted to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for dyslipidaemia management recognize that ASCVD risk is increased at TG levels > 1.7 mmol/L (> 150 mg/dL), but only recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in high-risk patients if > 2.3 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) after excluding secondary causes. There are also no treatment goals, either for plasma TG or indices of remnant abundance, given limited evidence from randomized controlled trials that lowering TG or TRL reduce ASCVD risk. Thus, strategic approaches to lowering TRL warrant discussion. This point is especially pertinent given that PESA reported the presence of peripheral atherosclerotic plaques in 58% of middle-aged individuals with elevated TG levels (≥ 1.7 mmol/L), low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk, and high or normal LDL-C.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants: metabolic insights, role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies-a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^bc9b38fe]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recent advances in human genetics, together with a large body of epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical trial results, provide strong support for a causal association between triglycerides (TG), TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and TRL remnants, and increased risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. These data also indicate that TRL and their remnants may contribute significantly to residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy. This statement critically appraises current understanding of the structure, function, and metabolism of TRL, and their pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Key points are (i) a working definition of normo- and hypertriglyceridaemic states and their relation to risk of ASCVD, (ii) a conceptual framework for the generation of remnants due to dysregulation of TRL production, lipolysis, and remodelling, as well as clearance of remnant lipoproteins from the circulation, (iii) the pleiotropic proatherogenic actions of TRL and remnants at the arterial wall, (iv) challenges in defining, quantitating, and assessing the atherogenic properties of remnant particles, and (v) exploration of the relative atherogenicity of TRL and remnants compared to LDL. Assessment of these issues provides a foundation for evaluating approaches to effectively reduce levels of TRL and remnants by targeting either production, lipolysis, or hepatic clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. This consensus statement updates current understanding in an integrated manner, thereby providing a platform for new therapeutic paradigms targeting TRL and their remnants, with the aim of reducing the risk of ASCVD.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, remnants and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: what we know and what we need to know [^6fad0888]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Apolipoprotein B-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) -chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), their remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) - are recognised as key contributors to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). On a per particle basis, genetic and clinical evidence indicates that TRL/remnants exhibit a greater atherogenic potential than LDL and evidence points to this being mediated by enhanced arterial wall retention of TRLs, the pro-inflammatory actions of their constituent apolipoproteins and cargo of cholesterol and bioactive lipids, and their capacity to induce endothelial dysfunction. Despite the strong association between plasma triglyceride levels and ASCVD, TRL-lowering trials have produced inconsistent, often negative results. The answer to this conundrum, as explored here, likely lies in the complexity of TRL structure, composition and metabolism, and in the dynamic influence that TRLs have on the properties of LDL, the most abundant atherogenic lipoprotein. The substantial heterogeneity in the TRL/remnant/IDL spectrum means that these particles present a wide range of potentially pathogenic factors to the artery wall in the form of major and minor lipids and a variety of surface apolipoproteins. Significant gaps exist in our knowledge: how are TRL remodelled during their lifetime in the bloodstream to become cholesterol-enriched lipoproteins; which are the most relevant TRL subspecies or TRL constituents, that initiate and progress the formation of atherosclerotic lesions; and what are the prime targets for effective intervention. Critical to the design of future triglyceride-lowering prevention trials will be the development of superior biomarkers of TRL/remnant atherogenicity and the development of a precision medicine approach to ASCVD prevention.

### Women, lipids, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a call to action from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^855adb45]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins

High levels of plasma TGs are a marker for high levels of TRLs, and as these are metabolized by cells, the cholesterol component — remnant cholesterol or TRL cholesterol — is more important for atherosclerosis. High plasma TGs also associate with vascular and systemic inflammation. Mendelian randomization studies suggested that the observed associations between TGs and remnant cholesterol may be causal; however, with the lack of robust evidence that lowering TGs or remnant cholesterol reduces ASCVD, current guidelines do not provide treatment goals.

As discussed, TGs increase from childhood until ∼70 years in women and ∼60 years in men (Figure 1). From 20–80 years, women consistently have lower TG levels than men, partly explained by higher alcohol intake in men, contributing to a lower prevalence with TGs > 2 mmol/L (Figure 5). Risk of ASCVD and mortality increases similarly in women and men as TG and remnant cholesterol levels increase.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^7581a87b]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.

Search strategy

References (English language only) were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published from 2000 by the use of the terms 'triglycerides'; 'lipoprotein remnants'; 'triglyceride-rich lipoproteins'; in combination with the terms 'cardiovascular disease'; 'atherosclerosis'; 'residual risk'; and 'therapeutics'. Relevant articles were also identified through searches of the reference lists of the identified literature.

Triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and remnants: definitions and clinical relevance

Triglycerides are an efficient means of storing excess energy, mainly in adipose tissue. In the blood, TG and cholesteryl esters (CE) circulate within the core of spherical lipoproteins, covered with a monolayer 'shell' of phospholipids and free cholesterol, with apolipoproteins stabilizing the structure. Apolipoprotein (apo) B is the major structural protein in TRL, present as either apoB100, made in the liver, or a truncated form, apoB48, made in the intestine. These isoforms, rather than size or density, best define the TRL class. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), made in the liver, contain apoB100 and are metabolized to VLDL remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and LDL. Chylomicrons, made in the intestine, are larger and contain apoB48, and are also metabolized to remnant particles but not to IDL and LDL (Figure 1). The intestine also secretes apoB48-containing VLDL-sized particles.

TRL decrease in size during lipolysis; concomitantly, the core content of TG decreases and CE increases due to cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of TRL–TG for LDL- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-CE. During lipolysis apoB remains with the TRL on which it was secreted. With one apoB molecule per particle, apoB concentration is thus a measure of particle number. Other apolipoproteins (particularly apoCs) transfer mainly to HDL during lipolysis. The spectrum of apoB100- and apoB48-containing remnants varies with plasma TG levels (Figure 1). At optimal levels (< 1.2 mmol/L or < 100 mg/dL), efficient lipolysis results in limited accumulation of remnant particles, predominantly in the small VLDL and IDL size range. At higher TG levels (e.g. ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or ≥ 260 mg/dL), increased secretion and impaired lipolysis result in the substantial accumulation of chylomicron and VLDL remnants.

### Quantifying triglyceride-rich lipoprotein atherogenicity, associations with inflammation, and implications for risk assessment using non-HDL cholesterol [^99927bad]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) have been implicated as causal agents in atherogenesis. The strongest evidence for this comes from studies in which variants in genes known to alter circulating triglyceride (TG) and hence TRL concentrations are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes. – The availability of large cohorts with extensive genotype and phenotype data has enabled exploration of the relative atherogenicity of TRL and their remnant particles (TRL/remnants) versus LDL on a per-particle basis (i.e. per unit apoB since TRL and LDL particles each contain one apoB protein). – Contrary to earlier reports, – it was demonstrated recently that TRL/remnants appeared to have a stronger association with CHD risk than LDL. One explanation for this might be lie in the higher cholesterol content of TRL/remnants compared to LDL. Another possibility arises from the fact that atherosclerosis has an inflammatory component, and there is evidence of a strong association between plasma TG and biomarkers of chronic inflammation. – However, the extent to which the relationship between TRL/remnants and chronic inflammation explains the causal association of these particles with CHD risk remains unclear.

In our previous study we identified two clusters of SNPs that had differing effects on TRL/remnants versus LDL; the SNP cluster that gave higher genetically predicted TRL/remnant levels was associated with a higher CHD risk per unit increase in apoB. The present investigation extended this SNP cluster-based approach to provide a quantitative estimate of the relative atherogenicity of TRL/remnant particles. Further, we explored the hypotheses that (a) a causal association of TRL/remnants with inflammation may help explain their greater atherogenicity, and (b) the difference in the strength of association of TRL/remnants and LDL with risk implies that the quantitative relationship of non-HDL cholesterol - the sum of TRL/remnant-C and LDL-C – to CHD risk is variable: a clinically important issue since this is a widely used index for risk assessment and treatment decisions.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^0434315a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years. However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridaemia are associated with a substantially increased long term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to reduction in HDL and increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms, such excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intensive lifestyle therapy is the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Statins are a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. If the primary goal is to lower TG levels, fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate for monotherapy, and in combination with statin; gemfibrozil only for monotherapy) could be the preferable drugs. Also ezetimibe has mild positive effects in lowering TG. Initial experience with en ezetimibe/fibrates combination seems promising. The recently released IMPROVE-IT Trial is the first to prove that adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe) to a statin lowers the risk of future CV events. In conclusion, the classical clinical paradigm of lipids-modifying treatment should be changed and high TG should be recognized as an important target for therapy in their own right. Hypertriglyceridemia should be treated.

### Variance in the composition and number of VLDL and LDL particles with increasing triglyceride or increasing apoB concentrations [^8ebf7d06]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The importance of any enhanced atherogenicity of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) will depend on the relative abundance of these particles compared with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or total apolipoprotein (apo)B. Accordingly, we determined the contribution that TRLs make to total apoB as TG or apoB concentrations increase. We also describe compositional changes in TRLs as TG or apoB increases to assess whether very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-[C]) is a valid proxy for VLDL-apoB.

Methods

We used sequential ultracentrifugation to separate lipoprotein fractions in plasma samples from 1940 dyslipidemic patients not on lipid-lowering medication, and measured apoB, cholesterol and TG in the plasma and in each subfraction. We analyzed these data in quartiles of TG or apoB.

Results

There was wide variance in all parameters in all quartiles of both TG and apoB. Although VLDL-apoB accounted for almost all the increase in total apoB across TG quartiles, LDL-apoB still accounted for 80% of the total in TG quartile 4. In contrast, LDL-apoB accounted for 90% of the increase in apoB across apoB quartiles. As TG increases, the increase in VLDL-C is explained more by increased VLDL-C/apoB when TG is moderately elevated, and more by increased VLDL-apoB when TG is very high.

Conclusions

In conclusion, VLDL-apoB only becomes a substantial component of total apoB with extreme hypertriglyceridemia and VLDL-C is not an appropriate proxy for VLDL-apoB.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^809ff46e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The EAS Consensus Panel is well aware of uncertainties and controversies regarding triglycerides and HDL-C levels, both as risk markers or targets of therapy. Triglycerides are predominantly carried in fasting conditions in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and their remnants, and postprandially in chylomicrons and their remnants. The generic term 'triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants', therefore, relates to chylomicron and VLDL particles which have undergone dynamic remodelling in the plasma after secretion from the intestine (chylomicrons) or liver (VLDL) (Figure 1). This remodelling results in a spectrum of particles which are heterogeneous in size, hydrated density, and lipid and protein compositionand include intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles. No single biochemical trait allows the differentiation of remnants from newly secreted chylomicrons, VLDL and IDL. Thus, plasma triglyceride levels correspond essentially to the sum of the triglyceride content in nascent VLDL and their remnants in the fasting state, together with that in chylomicrons and their remnants in the postprandial state. Consequently, the Panel has used the generic term 'triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnants' as a surrogate for plasma levels of both newly secreted TRLs and their remnants, the latter predominating in the typical person with cardiometabolic risk. As discussed below, increasing evidence suggests that remodelled chylomicrons and VLDL are atherogenic, primarily as a result of their progressive enrichment with cholesterol and depletion of triglycerides in the plasma compartment. This process also results in progressive reduction in their size. The term 'TRL remnants' has been used to emphasize our focus on atherogenic lipoproteins themselves rather than their major lipids.

Table 1
Overview of epidemiological evidence in community and clinical intervention populations supporting the association of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides with cardiovascular disease

While the 4S trial showed no association between on-treatment levels and changes from baseline levels for triglycerides and reduction in CV risk, data from more recent trials are indicative of association. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, on-treatment triglycerides < 1.7 mmol/L (< 150 mg/dL) were independently associated with a lower risk of recurrent coronary events in ACS patients at LDL-C goal (< 1.8 mmol/L or 70 mg/dL). Further, pooled analysis of the TNT and IDEAL trials showed a trend for decreased CV event risk with lowering of triglycerides (P < 0.001), although this was attenuated by adjustment for HDL-C and the ratio of apo B/apo A–I.

In T2DM patients, the FIELD and ACCORD Lipid studies showed that marked atherogenic dyslipidaemia (triglycerides ≥ 2.3 mmol/L or 204 mg/dL and low HDL-C levels (≤ 0.88 mmol/L or 34 mg/dL in ACCORD Lipid) was associated with increased CV event rates (by ∼30–70% vs. those without this profile). Analyses from FIELD show that the hazard ratios for HDL-C, apo A–I, apo B, and non-HDL-C were comparable for the prediction of CV risk whereas that for serum triglycerides was attenuated by adjustment for HDL-C (P = 0.07), concordant with the ERFC analysis.

Taken together, these observational and clinical trial data support the view that (i) a low HDL-C concentration is associated with CVD independent of LDL-C (or non-HDL-C) levels, and (ii) that elevated triglycerides are moderately associated with CVD, potentially largely through the number of TRL remnants. Thus, while LDL-C lowering remains the first priority, therapeutic targeting of low HDL-C and elevated TRL remnants may offer the possibility of incremental reduction in CV risk in high-risk populations.

### Genetics and causality of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^d2031efb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Triglycerides represent 1 component of a heterogeneous pool of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs). The reliance on triglycerides or TGRLs as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk biomarkers prompted investigations into therapies that lower plasma triglycerides as a means to reduce CVD events. Genetic studies identified TGRL components and pathways involved in their synthesis and metabolism. We advocate that only a subset of genetic mechanisms regulating TGRLs contribute to the risk of CVD events. This "omic" approach recently resulted in new targets for reducing CVD events.

Clinical Perspectives

Competency in Medical Knowledge

Hypercholesterolaemia is causatively linked to CHD and lowering of LDL reduces, but does not eliminate, risk of an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event, Recent advances in human genetics, together with epidemiologic and clinical trial results, indicate that the 'residual' ASCVD risk is in part caused by elevated levels of TRLs and their remnants. Here we show that TRL/remnant particles are about 4-fold more atherogenic than LDL on a per-particle (per apoB) basis, and that the causal relationship of non-HDL-C (per mmol/L) to CHD risk is not constant. These results have pathogenic and clinical implications. Since non-HDL-C is used widely as a risk factor in populations and for individuals, our observations indicate that the predicted risk may require adjusting upwards as the contribution of TRL/remnant-C to non-HDL-C rises.

Translational Outlook

Studies in primary cells and animal models using TRL/remnants isolated from humans with hypertriglyceridemia are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms as to why TRL/remnants are more atherogenic than LDL particles.

### Risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia: a review of real-world evidence [^bd9f87ac]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Residual cardiovascular (CV) risk in statin‐treated patients persists despite control of LDL cholesterol. 1 Other atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins, such as triglycerides (TGs) and TG‐rich lipoproteins (TRLs), are also likely causal and prognostic factors as well as potential treatment targets in atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). 1, 2 The biological plausibility of elevated TG and TRL levels as factors in residual CV risk is supported by epidemiological, genetic and clinical evidence. TG levels correlate with heightened risk for CV events in patients with well‐controlled LDL cholesterol levels on statin therapy. 3 Given that TGs are hydrophobic and do not float freely in plasma but are carried in such TG‐enriched lipoproteins as VLDL, VLDL remnants and intermediate‐density lipoprotein (IDL), the relationships observed probably reflect atherogenic effects exerted by both TGs and TRLs; this is reflected in non‐HDL cholesterol. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 TG‐enriched remnants, which include both small VLDL and IDL, are proinflammatory, induce endothelial dysfunction, and can be isolated from atheromatous plaque. 5, 11

In addition to the direct association between TG levels and CVD risk, elevated TGs also contribute to the atherogenic lipid triad. In patients with elevated TGs, there is typically a reduction in the activity of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme primarily responsible for hydrolysing TGs in the core of TRL. As TRL levels increase in plasma, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) engages in neutral lipid exchange between TRLs and both LDL cholesterol and HDL particles. CETP catalyses a 1:1 exchange of TGs for cholesterol between TRL and HDL and LDL particles. The LDL and HDL particles become more enriched with TGs and become better substrates for lipolysis by hepatic lipase, which results in increased HDL catabolism (and corresponding reductions in serum levels of this lipoprotein) and the formation of large numbers of smaller, denser LDL particles. This atherogenic lipid triad, consisting of high concentrations of TGs/TRLs, increased numbers of small‐dense LDLs and low levels of HDL, is particularly prevalent in patients with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus and is believed to underlie much of the accelerated atherogenesis in these patients.

Discussion

Measuring TG represents an easy means to estimate the combined mass of fasting or non-fasting TRLs, as surrogate for their cholesterol load. An excess of TRLs, including RLPs, throughout the nycthemeron epitomizes CMR conditions such the MetS, IR and the common form of T2DM. Elevated levels of TRL-C contribute, alongside LDL-C, to plaque formation and progression. TRL-C is a modifiable driver of RVR. Whereas TG as such are not atherogenic, the well-demonstrated association between fasting or non-fasting TG and CVD is underlied by the atherogenicity of TRLs, especially that of RLPs.

In fasting conditions, hypertriglyceridemia > 150 mg/dL is categorized as "elevated" VLDL, corresponding to TRL-C levels > 30 mg/dL. Such assumption of equivalence is valid only if the composition of VLDL, in terms of C and TG, is in a ratio of 1/5. This is not necessarily the case in CMR states where non-VLDL TRLs (among which numerous RLPs) co-exist alongside VLDL. Likewise, in non-fasting conditions, TRLs are further heterogeneous, in size and composition, being populated by various TG-enriched and relatively TG-depleted lipoproteins (including remnants from the endogenous and exogenous pathways). The C/TG ratio of non-fasting TRLs substantially differs from that of fasting TRLs, the latter essentially consisting of standard VLDL with 20% cholesterol.

While coronary risk was increased by 37% (95% CI 31–42%) per SD increase in log e triglycerides, this association was weakened after adjustment for HDL-C and abrogated after correction for non-HDL-C. Additionally, triglycerides were not associated with stroke risk after adjustment for other lipid factors. These data are compatible with the view that it is the number of TRL and remnant particles that cause CVD. Thus, the risk associated with elevated triglycerides can be explained by this lipid acting as a marker for increased numbers of TRL, which in turn are closely associated with the combination of higher levels of non-HDL-C and low levels of HDL-C. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, increased risk for MI, ischaemic stroke, and mortality was evident at markedly elevated triglycerides (> 5.0 mmol/L or > 450 mg/dL), although these data were not adjusted for non-HDL-C (Figure 5). Thus, low HDL-C and elevated non-HDL-C and triglycerides appear to be relevant to CV risk beyond LDL-C.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^ad8a0f08]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In dyslipidaemic patients with cardiometabolic risk, increased free fatty acid flux may represent a significant abnormality driving increased hepatic assembly and secretion of VLDL, IDL, and/or LDL particles, although other mechanisms are also implicated. Low plasma levels of HDL-apo A-I are associated with its increased fractional removal. This is driven by both cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated heteroexchange of triglycerides from apo B lipoproteins with cholesteryl ester from apo A-I lipoproteins, and dissociation of apo A-I from triglyceride-enriched HDL with clearance via the kidney. Such metabolic perturbations are frequently associated with insulin resistance, which may in turn influence the activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), CETP and potentially, hepatic lipase (HL), phospholipid transfer protein, and endothelial lipase. Within this large dyslipidaemic group, however, many patients do not exhibit insulin resistance but nonetheless display a mixed dyslipidaemia characterized by elevated levels of TRL and LDL. This lipid phenotype typically involves subnormal concentrations of HDL-C and increased cardiovascular risk. Finally, although there are close links, both pathophysiologic and genetic, between the dyslipidaemia of insulin resistance and the phenotype of familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL), some individuals with elevated levels of TRL remnants do not have insulin resistance or T2DM. Such individuals are at increased risk for premature CVD, although it is not clear if this risk is higher or lower than in those with the dyslipidaemia of insulin resistance and/or T2DM.

Pharmacological correction of hypertriglyceridaemia in T2DM does not usually normalize low apo A-I levels, which probably reflects the complex mechanisms involved. The complexity of HDL metabolism is clearly relevant when strategies to raise HDL-C are reviewed; indeed, HDL-C concentration is at most an indirect marker of the anti-atherogenic activities that are associated with this lipoprotein.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^f50ec7c5]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The correlation of plasma TG with ASCVD risk in epidemiological studies is attenuated or lost after adjusting for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) or apo B. Most circulating TG is carried by VLDL particles and their remnants, which contain apo B. All TRL particles, as well as LDL particles, contain a single apo B molecule. An estimate for all apo B-containing lipoproteins is non-HDL-C (calculated as TC − HDL-C). A recent Mendelian randomization study found that all apoB-containing lipoproteins have a similar effect on ASCVD risk. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk mediated by TRLs appears to be determined by the circulating concentration of apoB-containing particles rather than their TG content and that the clinical benefit of lowering TG correlates with the reduction in apoB, rather than the change in plasma TG concentration.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving statin therapy in the TNT trial [^7b610499]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mendelian randomization data suggest that the genetic determinants of lifetime higher triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-cholesterol (TRL-C) are causally related to cardiovascular disease and therefore a potential therapeutic target. The relevance of TRL-C among patients receiving statins is unknown. We assessed the relationship between TRL-C and cardiovascular risk, and whether this risk was modifiable among patients receiving statins in the TNT trial (Treating to New Targets).

Methods

Patients with coronary heart disease and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 130 to 250 mg/dL entered an 8-week run-in phase with atorvastatin 10 mg/d (ATV10). After this period, participants with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL entered the randomized phase with ATV10 (n = 5006) versus atorvastatin 80 mg/d (ATV80, n = 4995). The primary end point was coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). TRL-C was calculated as total cholesterol minus high-density lipoprotein cholesterol minus LDL-C. The effect of atorvastatin on TRL-C was assessed during the run-in phase (ATV10) and randomized phase (ATV80 versus ATV10). The risk of MACE was assessed across quintiles (Q) of baseline TRL-C (and, for comparison, by baseline triglycerides and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) during the randomized period. Last, the association between TRL-C changes with atorvastatin and cardiovascular risk was assessed by multivariate Cox regression.

Results

ATV10 reduced TRL-C 10.7% from an initial TRL-C of 33.9 ± 16.6 mg/dL. ATV80 led to an additional 15.4% reduction. Cardiovascular risk factors positively correlated with TRL-C. Among patients receiving ATV10, higher TRL-C was associated with higher 5-year MACE rates (Q1 = 9.7%, Q5 = 13.8%; hazard ratio Q5-versus-Q1, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–1.92; P-trend < 0.0001). ATV80 (versus ATV10) did not significantly alter the risk of MACE in Q1-Q2, but significantly reduced risk in Q3-Q5 (relative risk reduction, 29%-41%; all P < 0.0250), with evidence of effect modification (P-homogeneity = 0.0053); results were consistent for triglycerides (P-homogeneity = 0.0101) and directionally similar for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P-homogeneity = 0.1387). Last, in adjusted analyses, a 1 SD percentage reduction in TRL-C with atorvastatin resulted in a significant lower risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.00; P = 0.0482) independent of the reduction in LDL-C and of similar magnitude to that per 1 SD lowering in LDL-C (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.95; P = 0.0008).

Conclusions

The present post hoc analysis from TNT shows that increased TRL-C levels are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and provides evidence for the cardiovascular benefit of lipid lowering with statins among patients who have coronary heart disease with high TRL-C.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol, small dense LDL cholesterol, and incident cardiovascular disease [^952b4a05]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) and small-dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles are hallmarks of atherogenic dyslipidemia, and their cholesterol content is hypothesized to drive atherosclerotic risk. Prospective epidemiological data pertaining to cholesterol content of TRLs and sdLDL in primary prevention populations are mostly limited to coronary heart disease.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (TRL-C) and small-dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentrations associate with composite and individual incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes including myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke (IS), and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Methods

In a prospective case-cohort study within the Women's Health Study, TRL-C and sdLDL-C (mg/dl) were directly measured in baseline blood specimens of case subjects (n = 480) and the reference subcohort (n = 496). Risk associations were evaluated for total CVD (MI, IS, PAD, and CVD death), coronary and cerebrovascular disease (MI, IS, CVD death), and individual outcomes (MI, IS, and PAD). Models were adjusted for traditional risk factors, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Results

The risk of both composite outcomes significantly increased across quartiles of TRL-C and sdLDL-C. TRL-C was significantly associated with MI and PAD (MI hazard ratio [HR] Q4: 3.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to 6.39]; p trend = 0.002; PAD HR Q4: 2.58 [95% CI: 1.18 to 5.63]; p trend = 0.019), whereas sdLDL-C was significantly associated with MI alone (HR Q4: 3.71 [95% CI: 1.59 to 8.63]; p trend < 0.001). Both markers weakly associated with IS. Association patterns were similar for continuous exposures and, for TRL-C, among subjects with low atherogenic particle concentrations (apolipoprotein B < 100 mg/dl).

Conclusions

TRL-C strongly associates with future MI and PAD events, whereas sdLDL-C strongly associates with MI alone. These findings signal that the cholesterol content of TRLs and sdLDL influence atherogenesis independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, with potentially different potency across vascular beds.

### Γ-secretase inhibition lowers plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by stabilizing the LDL receptor [^2841ddbb]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Excess plasma triglycerides (TGs) are a key component of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. We have shown that γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment improves glucose tolerance due to inhibition of hepatic Notch signaling but found additional Notch-independent reduction of plasma TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in GSI-treated, as well as hepatocyte-specific, γ-secretase knockout (L-Ncst) mice, which suggested a primary effect on hepatocyte TRL uptake. Indeed, we found increased VLDL and LDL particle uptake in L-Ncst hepatocytes and Ncst-deficient hepatoma cells, in part through reduced γ-secretase-mediated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) cleavage and degradation. To exploit this novel finding, we generated a liver-selective Nicastrin ASO, which recapitulated glucose and lipid improvements of L-Ncst mice, with increased levels of hepatocyte LDLR. Collectively, these results identify the role of hepatic γ-secretase to regulate LDLR and suggest that liver-specific GSIs may simultaneously improve multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.

### Relative effect of hypertriglyceridemia on non-HDLC and apolipoprotein B as cardiovascular disease risk markers [^7793201b]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDLC) represents the cholesterol in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Apolipoprotein B (apoB) reflects the number of TRL and LDL particles. In hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), there is triglyceride (TG) enrichment of TRLs, and also a substantial increase of cholesterol in larger TRLs that considerably augments the non-HDLC value. Therefore, in HTG, non-HDLC could increase disproportionately with respect to apoB.

Objective

We aimed to compare the relative effect of the full range of mild, moderate, and severe HTG on the status of non-HDLC and apoB as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers.

Methods

Analysis of lipid profile data from 4347 patients in a Lipid Clinic cohort with baseline fasting lipid profiles documented prior to starting lipid-lowering medications. The correlation between non-HDLC and apoB was assessed in intervals of increasing TG. Non-HDLC and apoB were analyzed at each TG level using comparative CVD risk equivalent categories and assessed for divergence and discordance.

Results

With increasing TG levels: (1) the correlation between non-HDLC and apoB diminished progressively, (2) non-HDLC levels increased continuously, whereas apoB levels plateaued after an initial increase up to TG of ~ 4.0–5.0 mmol/L (~354–443 mg/dL), (3) there was divergence in the stratification of non-HDLC and apoB into CVD risk equivalent categories.

Conclusions

Non-HDLC and apoB should not be viewed as interchangeable CVD risk markers in the presence of severe HTG. This has never been tested. With increasing HTG severity, discordance between non-HDLC and apoB can cause clinically important divergence in CVD risk categorization.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^7f5032d4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Residual atherogenic burden assessment at low LDL-C — For patients at high ASCVD risk with LDL-C < 70 mg/dl, residual burden may be assessed using measures beyond LDL-C; the three most widely used assays are non-HDL-C, apoB, and LDL-P, which are more likely to be discordant from LDL-C in the presence of elevated plasma TG and/or low HDL-C. Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (TRL-C) is at least equivalent in atherogenicity to LDL-C, and a level of TRL-C < 30 mg/dl is considered desirable. Because non-HDL-C represents [(LDL-C) + (TRL-C)], a desirable level would be < 100 mg/dl once LDL-C is less than 70 mg/dL. Measurements of apoB or LDL-P may effectively identify patients with increased ASCVD risk due to higher atherogenic lipoprotein burden, and such patients may benefit from additional therapy (higher statin doses, adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors), although data from clinical trials are lacking on this topic.

Prevalence of elevated triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol

First, it is important to ascertain the prevalence of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, i.e. the combination of elevated TRL remnants and/or low HDL-C. Among the general population plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C are normally distributed. In contrast, the distributions of triglycerides, remnant cholesterol, apo B, and non-HDL-C (i.e. total cholesterol−HDL-C) tend to be skewed with a tail toward the highest levels. In the Copenhagen General Population Study, low HDL-C levels were frequently associated with elevated levels of cholesterol and TRL remnants (Figure 3). Approximately 45% of men and 30% of women in the study had triglycerides ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) with or without HDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) (BG Nordestgaard, unpublished results). HDL-C levels are lower in Turkish populations, largely due to genetic predisposition. The Turkish Heart Study reported that ∼50% of men and ∼25% of women had HDL-C levels ≤ 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL). As in other countries, atherogenic dyslipidaemia is on the rise, due to the increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. In the Turkish Adults Risk Factor Study, ∼40% of men and 35% of women had triglycerides > 1.7 mmol/L with or without low HDL-C (≤ 0.9 mmol/L or 35 mg/dL).

### Role of growth hormone in hepatic and intestinal triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism [^0c90826d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated plasma concentrations of hepatic- and intestinally-derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) are implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Excess of TRL is the driving cause of atherogenic dyslipidemia commonly occurring in insulin-resistant individuals such as patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, growth hormone (GH)-deficient individuals display similar atherogenic dyslipidemia, suggesting an important role of GH and GH deficiency in the regulation of TRL metabolism.

Objective

We aimed to examine the direct and/or indirect role of GH on TRL metabolism.

Methods

We investigated the effect on fasting and postprandial hepatic-TRL and intestinal-TRL metabolism of short-term (one month) withdrawal of GH in 10 GH-deficient adults.

Results

After GH withdrawal, we found a reduction in fasting plasma TRL concentration (significant decrease in TRL-TG, TRL-cholesterol, TRL-apoB-100, TRL-apoC-III and TRL-apoC-II) but not in postprandial TRL response. This reduction was due to fewer fasting TRL particles without a change in TG per particle and was not accompanied by a change in postprandial TRL-apoB-48 response. Individual reductions in TRL correlated strongly with increases in insulin sensitivity and decreases in TRL-apoC-III.

Conclusion

In this relatively short term 'loss of function' human experimental model, we have shown an unanticipated reduction of hepatic-TRL particles despite increase in total body fat mass and reduction in lean mass. These findings contrast with the atherogenic dyslipidemia previously described in chronic GH deficient states, providing a new perspective for the role of GH in lipoprotein metabolism.

### Triglyceride treatment in the age of cholesterol reduction [^b9169633]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Cholesterol reduction has markedly reduced major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and shown regression of atherosclerosis in some studies. However, CVD has for decades also been associated with increased levels of circulating triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. Whether this is due to a direct toxic effect of these lipoproteins on arteries or whether this is merely an association is unresolved. More recent genetic analyses have linked genes that modulate TG metabolism with CVD. Moreover, analyses of subgroups of hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) subjects in clinical trials using fibric acid drugs have been interpreted as evidence that TG reduction reduces CVD events. This review will focus on how HTG might cause CVD, whether TG reduction makes a difference, what pathophysiological defects cause HTG, and what options are available for treatment.

### Impact of remnant cholesterol on short-term and long-term prognosis in patients with prediabetes or diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: a large-scale cohort study [^e3e69854]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The global prevalence of diabetes is steadily increasing, with over 600 million people projected to have type 2 diabetes and a similar number expected to develop prediabetes by 2045. A significant proportion of these individuals also suffer from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of mortality in this population. Compared to ASCVD patients with normal glucose metabolism, those with diabetes or prediabetes typically present with dyslipidemia characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides [contained in very low-density lipoproteins, intermediate-density lipoproteins, and in chylomicron remnants; collectively known as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs)], low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increased small, dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL) particles. These lipid abnormalities are strongly associated with poor ASCVD outcomes, even when LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are substantially lowered or optimized according to current guidelines. Remnant cholesterol (remnant-C) is the cholesterol content of TRLs. Unlike triglycerides (TGs) in TRLs, which can be metabolized by most cells, remnant-C accumulates in arterial walls, playing a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that remnant-C levels are significantly elevated in patients with diabetes or prediabetes, and this elevation is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### The role of remnant cholesterol beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in diabetes mellitus [^3343786f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to defects in glucose metabolism. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 536.6 million people worldwide aged 21–79 were afflicted with DM in 2021. With rapid developments in the global economy and changes in diet, the high morbidity and disability exhibited in DM has become a significant public health issue that has reached alarming levels.

Previous studies have shown that dyslipidemia appears in the early stages of DM and continues to be involved in the disease progresses throughout its entire course. Among the spectrum of lipoproteins, there is no doubt that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the most important one. However, with the widespread use of statins in recent years, we have shifted our attention to triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), one of the hallmarks of diabetic dyslipidemia that cannot be controlled by statins. There has been increasing evidence in recent years that TRLs are associated with the onset of diabetes. A molecular lipid analysis showed that plasma TG levels were the only variable associated with DM in high-risk groups, and a high-fat diet increased the synthesis of TG in the liver, reduced relative high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and accelerated the onset of DM. In population cohort studies, a higher TG-related indicators were associated with DM independent of insulin resistance, highlighting the importance of TRLs in the development of DM.

### Association of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-cholesterol with recurrent cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients according to different inflammatory status [^e50f9428]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The association of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-cholesterol (TRL-C) with recurrent cardiovascular events (RCVEs) has not been studied. Moreover, whether inflammation can affect TRL-C-associated cardiovascular risk is unknown. This study sought to examine the association between TRL-C and RCVEs, and whether this relationship is modulated by systemic inflammation in statin-treated patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and nearly normal triglyceride.

Methods

In this study, 6723 CAD patients were consecutively enrolled, following a first CVE with triglyceride < 2.3 mmol/L. Baseline lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were determined. All patients were searched for RCVEs. The risk of RCVEs was assessed across quartiles (Q) of baseline TRL-C and further stratified by the median of hsCRP.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 58.91 ± 17.79 months, 538 RCVEs were recorded. After adjustment for potential confounders, Q4 of TRL-C was significantly associated with the risk of RCVEs, which remained unchanged after hsCRP stratification. When subjects were grouped according to both TRL-C and hsCRP levels, patients with Q4 of TRL-C and hsCRP had the highest increase of the risk of RCVEs compared with the reference group (TRL-C Q1-3 and hsCRP Q1-3; HR, 1.90; 95%CI: 1.27–2.87). Furthermore, adding TRL-C to the original predicting model led to a slight but significant improvement.

Conclusions

The present analysis firstly showed that elevated TRL-C was associated with an increased RCVEs risk in statin-treated patients with CAD independent of systemic inflammation, suggesting that it might be a useful marker for risk stratification and a treatment target in this patient population.

### The association between triglycerides and incident cardiovascular disease: what is "optimal"? [^bcbeb1b4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated triglycerides (TGs) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the best way to both measure TGs and assess TG-related risk remains unknown.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between TGs and CVD and determine whether the average of a series of TG measurements is more predictive of CVD risk than a single TG measurement.

Methods

We examined 15,792 study participants, aged 40–65 years, free of CVD from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and Framingham Offspring studies, using fasting TG measurements across multiple examinations over time. With up to 10 years of follow-up, we assessed time-to-first CVD event, as well as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.

Results

Compared with a single TG measurement, average TGs over time had greater discrimination for CVD risk (C-statistic, 0.60 vs 0.57). Risk for CVD increased as average TGs rose until an inflection point of ~100 mg/dL in men and ~200 mg/dL in women, above which this risk association plateaued. The relationship between average TGs and CVD remained statistically significant in multivariable modeling adjusting for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and interactions were found by sex and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.

Conclusions

The average of several TG readings provides incremental improvements for the prediction of CVD relative to a single TG measurement. Regardless of the method of measurement, higher TGs were associated with increased CVD risk, even at levels previously considered "optimal" (< 150 mg/dL).

Figure 1
Overview of the development of atherogenic dyslipidaemia. (A) In the physiological state, the liver produces triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B100-containing very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Triglycerides in these particles are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to release free fatty acids (FFA). Both angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) are endogenous inhibitors of LPL. Delipidation of VLDL results in the formation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnants, which are further delipidated to become LDLs. LDL is taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor (LDLR) and thereby removed from the circulation. (B) Atherogenic dyslipidaemia is characterized by increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and secretion of larger, more triglyceride-rich VLDL from the liver, impaired LPL–mediated lipolysis, and reduced uptake of LDL. All these factors lead to increased accumulation of TRL remnants and LDL. Both LDL and TRL remnants can transverse the endothelium and contribute to lesion initiation and progression in artery walls

The relationship between lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance is key in atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Insulin resistance causes a marked dysregulation of lipolytic activities, particularly in adipose tissue, resulting in a net increase in the release of free fatty acids (FFAs). Elevated FFAs, together with hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, drive VLDL production, raising total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. A decrease in LPL activity further contributes to increased triglyceride levels. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein becomes activated, transferring cholesterol from HDL particles to TRLs. This process leads to the formation of small, dense HDL particles, which are cleared faster, lowering HDL levels. Increased production of TRLs (both VLDL and chylomicrons) and impaired lipolysis of TRL remnants contribute to postprandial dyslipidaemia. These combined changes exacerbate atherogenic risk.

### FGF21 lowers plasma triglycerides by accelerating lipoprotein catabolism in white and Brown adipose tissues [^362c85c2]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

FGF21 decreases plasma triglycerides (TGs) in rodents and humans; however, the underlying mechanism or mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we examined the role of FGF21 in production and disposal of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in mice. Treatment with pharmacological doses of FGF21 acutely reduced plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), liver TG content, and VLDL-TG secretion. In addition, metabolic turnover studies revealed that FGF21 facilitated the catabolism of TRL in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). FGF21-dependent TRL processing was strongly attenuated in CD36-deficient mice and transgenic mice lacking lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissues. Insulin resistance in diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice shifted FGF21 responses from WAT toward energy-combusting BAT. In conclusion, FGF21 lowers plasma TGs through a dual mechanism: first, by reducing NEFA plasma levels and consequently hepatic VLDL lipidation and, second, by increasing CD36 and LPL-dependent TRL disposal in WAT and BAT.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^c4f2fae4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Triglycerides and atherogenesis

Currently LDL is considered as the major atherogenic lipoprotein; however other lipoproteins size is of key importance in determining whether particles can penetrate the arterial wall. The plasma TG level represents in part the concentration of the TRL: VLDL, chylomicrons and their remnants. Although chylomicrons and probably VLDL are both too large to penetrate the arterial wall, their remnants are small enough to do this, and have been demonstrated in human and animal atherosclerotic plaques.

Physiologically TG are the densest form of calories and serve as an important source of energy. Dietary TG are assembled in the gut into chylomicrons. Their interaction with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) located on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells leads to liberation of free fatty acids from TG; free fatty acids are able to traverse cell membranes. Only 50% of chylomicron's TG is estimated to be lost in this process, and the remainder of the lipoprotein, called a chylomicron remnant, contains lipids such as cholesteryl esters, retinylesters, and apoB-48.

VLDL particles are the main TG carrier in the circulation, being produced by the liver, whereas the VLDL TG content is derived from a variety of substrates including lipoprotein TG and FFA. VLDL TG lose FFA by the action of LpL as well, leading to production of VLDL remnants, also referred to as intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and eventually to conversion to LDL. The concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. These lipoproteins contain at least as much cholesterol per particle as does LDL. TG itself is not a component of arterial plaque, but cholesterol within TG -rich particles contributes to plaque development.

VLDL can be divided into large, TG -rich VLDL1 and small, dense VLDL2. VLDL1 has a higher TG content and exhibit abundant apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) and apolipoprotein E.

### Dissociation between the insulin-sensitizing effect of rosiglitazone and its effect on hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein production [^8082c042]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Despite its potent, well-documented insulin-sensitizing effects, rosiglitazone (RSG) does not effectively ameliorate the hypertriglyceridemia of insulin-resistant or diabetic individuals and has even been shown to slightly but significantly increase triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) in some studies. The mechanism of this effect is currently not known.

Objective

We investigated the effect of RSG treatment on TRL metabolism.

Design

This was a 12-wk, single-sequence, cross-over study of rosiglitazone vs. placebo for 6 wk.

Participants

Participants included 17 nondiabetic men with a broad range of insulin sensitivity.

Intervention

INTERVENTION included rosiglitazone 8 mg/d vs. placebo for 6 wk.

Main Outcome Measure

TRL metabolism (concentration, production and catabolic rates) was assessed in a constant fed state with a 12-h primed constant infusion of [D3]l-leucine and multicompartmental modeling.

Results

RSG treatment resulted in significant insulin sensitization with no change in body weight. Fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration, however, was higher with RSG vs. placebo (P = 0.0006), as were fasting and fed TRL-TG, TRL-apoB-48, and TRL-apoB-100 (fed TRL-apoB-48: 0.93 ± 0.08 vs. 0.76 ± 0.07 mg/dl, P = 0.017, and fed TRL-apoB-100: 15.57 ± 0.90 vs. 13.71 ± 1.27 mg/dl, P = 0.029). This small but significant increase in plasma TRL concentration was explained by a tendency for RSG to increase TRL production and reduce particle clearance, as indicated by the significantly increased production to clearance ratios for both apoB-48-containing (0.43 ± 0.03 vs. 0.34 ± 0.03, P = 0.048) and apoB-100-containing (7.0 ± 0.4 vs. 6.2 ± 0.6, P = 0.029) TRL.

Conclusion

These data indicate dissociation between the insulin-sensitizing effects of RSG and absence of anticipated reductions in production rates of apoB-100- and apoB-48-containing-TRL particles, which may explain the absence of TG lowering seen in humans treated with this agent.

### Design and rationale of the ODYSSEY DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA trial: lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia at high cardiovascular risk [^90e21c5f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Individuals with T2DM often have elevated levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which further increase their cardiovascular risk. Mixed dyslipidaemia is commonly associated with insulin resistance, which accounts for increased hepatic production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), enhanced intestinal production of chylomicrons, and reduced hepatic clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL). The management of mixed dyslipidaemia is a persistent challenge in clinical practice.

The relationship between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk is well established. However, non-HDL-C, which can easily be calculated from a routine lipid panel by subtracting HDL-C from total cholesterol (TC), is considered a better predictor of cardiovascular risk, particularly in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia. Non-HDL-C has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mixed dyslipidaemia since it encompasses all circulating atherogenic cholesterol carried by apolipoprotein (Apo) B-containing lipoprotein particles, like TRL, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. The National Lipid Association recommendations indicate non-HDL-C as a co-primary, but superior, treatment target with LDL-C. Recent European guidelines recommend non-HDL-C as a practical alternative treatment target. However, the effect of novel lipid-lowering treatments on this parameter is still poorly studied.

### Intravenous glucose acutely stimulates intestinal lipoprotein secretion in healthy humans [^05b505c2]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Increased production of intestinal triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) contributes to dyslipidemia and increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We have previously demonstrated that enteral glucose enhances lipid-stimulated intestinal lipoprotein particle secretion. Here, we assessed whether glucose delivered systemically by intravenous infusion also enhances intestinal lipoprotein particle secretion in humans.

Approach and Results

On 2 occasions, 4 to 6 weeks apart and in random order, 10 healthy men received a constant 15-hour intravenous infusion of either 20% glucose to induce hyperglycemia or normal saline as control. Production of TRL-apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48, primary outcomes) and apoB100 (secondary outcomes) was assessed during hourly liquid-mixed macronutrient formula ingestion with stable isotope enrichment and multicompartmental modeling, under pancreatic clamp conditions to limit perturbations in pancreatic hormones (insulin and glucagon) and growth hormone. Compared with saline infusion, glucose infusion induced both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, increased plasma triglyceride levels, and increased TRL-apoB48 concentration and production rate (P < 0.05), without affecting TRL-apoB48 fractional catabolic rate. No significant effect of hyperglycemia on TRL-apoB100 concentration and kinetic parameters was observed.

Conclusions

Short-term intravenous infusion of glucose stimulates intestinal lipoprotein production. Hyperglycemia may contribute to intestinal lipoprotein overproduction in type 2 diabetes.

### Relation between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol / apolipoprotein B ratio and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in patients with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^7dae28bf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study we showed that the LDL metabolism abnormality in CAD patients with DM is a pathological condition that strongly induces a decrease in LDL-particle size. A similar phenomenon occurs even in patients whose serum LDL-C levels are well controlled, and impaired TG metabolism plays a large role. Although this study evaluated the risk of CAD in DM by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal design that focused on LDL-particle size and TG metabolism, the results may indicate the necessity of monitoring the qualitative changes in LDL-C, in addition to the quantitative changes, especially in CAD patients with DM.

Triglyceride is known as the most powerful determinant of the LDL-particle size. LDL-particle size shows a significantly negative correlation with the fasting and postprandial serum TG levels, and is associated with postprandial hyperlipidemia often seen in patients with CAD and/or DM. Metabolism of TG-rich large VLDL is slower than that of ordinary VLDL. In cases where smaller LDL-particles are predominant, the formation of large VLDL increases, and accumulation of TRLs occurs under the influence of increased large VLDL formation and delayed catabolism of the large VLDL. Transfer of lipids takes place between the TRLs increased thus and HDL, leading to an increase of TG-rich LDL and formation of smaller LDL through degradation of TG via hepatic lipase activity. As illustrated above, investigations have been reported concerning the association of increase in TRLs (as a result of abnormal TG metabolism) with reduction of the LDL-particle size. The results of the present study may be interpreted as indicating that promotion of LDL-particle size reduction by the above-mentioned abnormal TG metabolism is more marked in CAD patients with underlying DM.

### Apolipoprotein A-V deficiency results in marked hypertriglyceridemia attributable to decreased lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and removal of their remnants [^48479fd9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

ApoAV, a newly discovered apoprotein, affects plasma triglyceride level. To determine how this occurs, we studied triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism in mice deficient in apoAV.

Methods and Results

No significant difference in triglyceride production rate was found between apoa5(-/-) mice and controls. The presence or absence of apoAV affected TRL catabolism. After the injection of 14C-palmitate and 3H-cholesterol labeled chylomicrons and (125)I-labeled chylomicron remnants, the disappearance of 14C, 3H, and (125)I was significantly slower in apoa5(-/-) mice relative to controls. This was because of diminished lipolysis of TRL and the reduced rate of uptake of their remnants in apoa5(-/-) mice. Observed elevated cholesterol level was caused by increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in apoa5(-/-) mice. VLDL from apoa5(-/-) mice were poor substrate for lipoprotein lipase, and did not bind to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor as well as normal very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). LDL receptor levels were slightly elevated in apoa5(-/-) mice consistent with lower remnant uptake rates. These alterations may be the result of the lower apoE-to-apoC ratio found in VLDL isolated from apoa5(-/-) mice.

Conclusions

These results support the hypothesis that the absence of apoAV slows lipolysis of TRL and the removal of their remnants by regulating their apoproteins content after secretion.

### Triglycerides: a reappraisal [^4ea8cf72]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated cholesterol levels are clearly independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Another class of lipid particles, triglycerides, is also abundant in the human body and has been found in atherosclerotic plaques. Recent observational studies have demonstrated an association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk for future cardiovascular events. With this knowledge and the discovery of effective agents to lower triglyceride levels, the management of triglycerides is currently undergoing a renaissance. Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been completed to date, proving that lowering triglycerides will reduce cardiovascular events. In this review we highlight some of the evidence that led to this stage and discuss the current data on pharmacologic intervention of triglyceride levels and the effect on clinical outcomes. Lastly, we want to give the reader insight on what the most recent lipid guidelines state about clinical triglyceride management, mention new pharmacological agents, and highlight the clinical evidence for safe and effective lowering of triglycerides levels with life style modification.

### Effects of atorvastatin on fasting plasma and marginated apolipoproteins B48 and B100 in large, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in familial combined hyperlipidemia [^030bb788]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Large triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) circulate in the blood, but they may also be present in a marginated pool, probably attached to the endothelium. It is unknown whether statins can influence this marginated pool in vivo in humans. Intravenous fat tests were performed in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) subjects before and after atorvastatin treatment and in controls to investigate whether acute increases in apoB in TRL fractions would occur, potentially reflecting the release of this TRL from a marginated pool. After a 12-h fast, a bolus injection of 10% Intralipid was given to 12 FCHL patients before and after 16-wk treatment with atorvastatin. Twelve carefully matched controls were included. For 60 min postinjection, apoB48, apoB100, and lipids were measured in TRLs. Fasting apoB100 in all TRL fractions were 2- to 3-fold higher in untreated FCHL compared with controls. ApoB48 concentrations in chylomicron fractions increased significantly within 10 min in FCHL before and after treatment, but not in controls. ApoB100 increased significantly in the chylomicron fractions in untreated FCHL and in controls, but not in FCHL after treatment. In very low density lipoprotein 1, apoB100 increased only in untreated FCHL. In very low density lipoprotein 2, apoB100 did not change in any group. These data show that increasing the number of circulating TRLs by chylomicron-like particles, results in increased plasma apoB-TRLs, probably by acute release from a marginated pool. This is a physiological process occurring in FCHL and in healthy normolipidemic subjects, but it is more pronounced in the former. Decreased marginated TRL particles in FCHL is a novel antiatherogenic property of atorvastatin.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and atherosclerotic risk — human genetic, epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical trial data support a causal association between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (including VLDL and their remnants, chylomicrons and their remnants, and IDL) and increased risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis; increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins represent increased residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized LDL-C lowering therapy, remnant lipoproteins may contain up to 4 times more cholesterol per particle than LDL particles, readily penetrate the arterial wall, can be taken up by scavenger receptors on macrophages directly without modification, and are further hydrolyzed to create LDL particles via lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, with LDL particles as the end-product of VLDL metabolism that are generally triglyceride poor and enriched with cholesterol ester.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^8a7ae9e6]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Data for gene variants associated with isolated changes in plasma HDL-C levels are more conflicting. For example, increased plasma levels of HDL-C were correlated with increased CV risk in individuals with SNPs in the LIPC gene associated with reduced HL activity. – In contrast, genetic variants in ABCA1 associated with substantial reductions in HDL-C levels (with no changes in other lipids) were not associated with increased CV risk. On the other hand, three common CETP genotypes (Taq IB, I405V, and −629C > A) associated with lower CETP activity and higher HDL-C levels were inversely associated with coronary risk. In GWAS of genes known to impact HDL metabolism, the effects that such variants exert on HDL-C levels account for < 5% and frequently < 2% of variability. These data imply that in the general population, HDL-C concentration represents the integral sum of many gene effects on HDL metabolism. The current literature on the human genetics of HDL and TRL and their remnants highlights the need for clarification of the interaction between genes and different metabolic pathways, particularly for HDL.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1 The reasons are probably multifactorial, but a relevant contributory factor may be the greater prevalence of mixed dyslipidaemia, which is characterized by elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and thus elevated TG‐rich lipoprotein (TRL) and TRL cholesterol levels, as well as low levels of HDL cholesterol. 2 Mixed dyslipidaemia in T2DM might not be detected with measurement of LDL cholesterol levels, as these may remain within a normal range. 3 Non‐HDL cholesterol (calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol), accounts for the sum of all atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol, intermediate‐density lipoprotein, very‐low‐density lipoprotein [VLDL], VLDL remnants, chylomicron remnants, and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]) and has been suggested to be a better indicator of cardiovascular (CV) risk than LDL cholesterol among individuals with elevated TG levels, including individuals with dyslipidaemia. 3, 4, 5 Populations with mixed dyslipidaemia also have qualitative changes in LDL particles, with a higher number of smaller, more dense LDL particles; these are believed to be more atherogenic than larger, more buoyant particles. 2

Lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) with statins increases the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins and thus reduces plasma cholesterol levels, principally through reductions in LDL cholesterol. 6 This results in a significantly lower risk of ASCVD with the proportional benefit related to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol. 7 Other therapeutic approaches that further increase clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins include ezetimibe 8 and the inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9 (PCSK9), alirocumab 9 and evolocumab. 10 Adding ezetimibe or evolocumab to statin significantly reduces CV events (the CV outcomes study with alirocumab [NCT01663402] is ongoing) 11, 12; however, no previous study has prospectively evaluated PCSK9 inhibition in individuals with diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia or compared different therapeutic options among individuals with elevated TG levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, an important consideration given the "real‐world" clinical uncertainty around potential therapeutic agents which principally reduce either the synthesis of TRL particles (fibrates), lipolysis of TGs (omega‐3 fatty acids), clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins (ezetimibe), or a combination of these mechanisms (nicotinic acid).

### Altered composition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and coronary artery disease in a large case-control study [^2093980e]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional beta-quantification of plasma lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation separates triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) from higher density lipoproteins. The cholesterol in the TGRL fraction is referred to as measured very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) recognizing that other TGRL may be present. The measured VLDL-C to total plasma triglyceride (VLDL-C/TG) has long been considered an index of average TGRL composition with abnormally high VLDL-C/TG ratios (≥ 0.30 with TG > 150mg/dL) indicative of atherogenic remnant accumulation (type III hyperlipidemia). However, virtually no reports are available which examine potential associations between CAD and VLDL-C/TG at the lower end of the spectrum.

Methods and Results

We performed ultracentrifugation in 1170 cases with premature-onset, familial CAD and 1759 population-based controls and examined the VLDL-C/TG ratio as an index of TGRL composition. As expected, we found very high CAD risk associated with severe type III hyperlipidemia (OR 10.5, p = 0.02). Unexpectedly, however, we found a robust, graded, and independent association between CAD risk and lower than average VLDL-C/TG ratios (p < 0.0001 as ordered categories or as a continuous variable). Among those in the lowest VLDL-C/TG category (a ratio < 0.12), CAD risk was clearly increased (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.9–6.9) and remained significantly elevated in various subgroups including those with triglycerides below 200mg/dl, in males and females separately, as well as among those with no traditional CAD risk factors (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.5–22). Significant compositional differences by case status were confirmed in a subset whose samples were re-spun with measurement of lipids and apolipoprotein B (apo B) in each subfraction.

Conclusions

We found a strong, graded, independent, and robust association between CAD and lower VLDL-C/TG ratios. We consider this a novel, hypothesis-generating observation which will hopefully generate additional future studies to provide confirmation and further insight into potential mechanisms.

### Pla2g12b drives expansion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [^af8f7c13]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Triglyceride transfer activity can be monitored directly in vitro. This assay monitors the increase in fluorescence intensity as MTP transfers fluorescently labeled triglycerides from quenched donor vesicles to unquenched acceptors, either TRLs or APOB-free acceptor vesicles (AV, Fig. 4D). Soluble ER-lumenal extracts from wild-type and Pla2g12b hlb218 mutant mice were used as a source of MTP for these assays. Transfer activity to each of these donor types was evaluated in the context of varying concentrations of calcium. Calcium supplementation had no effect on the rate of triglyceride transfer to APOB-free acceptor vesicles (Fig. 4E), but increased the rate of triglyceride transfer to TRLs by ~60% (Fig. 4F, G). This in vitro assay uses only soluble ER-resident proteins, which excludes the PLA2G12B (Fig. 3G). Accordingly, identical results were observed when PLA2G12B hlb218 extracts were used as a source of MTP (Fig. 4H–K), which suggests that the calcium dependence of TRL expansion is not solely attributable the calcium dependence of PLA2G12B.

We conclude that under in vitro conditions, high concentrations of calcium selectively increase triglyceride transfer to TRLs but have no effect on transfer to APOB-free acceptor vesicles (Fig. 4K). We also demonstrate that physiological calcium levels are essential for TRL expansion in vivo (Fig. 4A–C).

Hypolipidemia in Pla2g12b −/− mutants

Mutations in Pla2g12b result in significantly lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol in mice. To determine the precise changes in lipoprotein composition contributing to hypolipidemia, we performed FPLC and enzymatic lipid profiling on plasma isolated from Pla2g12b hlb218 mutant mice and their wild-type siblings (Fig. 5A–H). Pla2g12b hlb218 is a point mutation generated by ENU that substitutes a cysteine residue at position 129 with tyrosine (C129Y). As expected, we found that VLDL, the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins secreted from the liver, exhibited a > 80% reduction in triglyceride content (Fig. 5B). However, despite this drastic decrease in triglyceride content, the cholesterol content of VLDL particles remained unchanged (black arrowhead Fig. 5E, F). We conclude that the abnormal TRLs secreted by Pla2g12b hlb218 mutants are selectively depleted in triglycerides.

### Postprandial hyperlipidemia: another correlate of the "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype in men [^0ef7f270]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

Fasting hypertriglyceridemia has been reported to be predictive of an exaggerated triglyceride (TG) response to an oral fat load. Abdominal obesity has also been associated with postprandial hyperlipidemia. The objective of the present study was to quantify the contribution of abdominal obesity and fasting hypertriglyceridemia to the magnitude of postprandial lipemia. For that purpose, potential differences in postprandial TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) levels were examined among men characterized by the absence/presence of the "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype following a standardized breakfast with a high fat content (64% calories as fat). Sixty-nine men (mean age ± S.D.: 45.1 ± 10.5 years) were classified according to waist girth (< 90 or > / or = 90 cm) and fasting TG concentrations (< 2.0 or ≥ 2.0 mmol/l). Subjects characterized by "hypertriglyceridemic waist" (waist ≥ 90 cm and fasting TG ≥ 2.0 mmol/l) showed the highest TRL-TG concentrations (P < 0.0001) throughout the entire postprandial period (8 h) as well as elevated concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 and apo B-100 in all TRL fractions (large, medium and small) compared to subjects with low fasting TG levels who had waist girth values either above or below 90 cm. These higher postprandial TRL-TG levels among carriers of the "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype also led to significantly greater postprandial TG-total area under the curve (AUC) in total TRLs resulting mainly from the increased concentrations of large- and medium-sized TRLs. Furthermore, subjects characterized by the "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype displayed higher fasting insulin concentrations and postprandial insulin AUC compared to men with low fasting plasma TG levels and low waist girth values. In conclusion, results of the present study indicate that postprandial hyperlipidemia is associated with the simultaneous presence of abdominal obesity and elevated fasting TG concentrations: a condition that we have described as the "hypertriglyceridemic waist" phenotype.

### Novel unbiased equations to calculate triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol from routine non-fasting lipids [^61cc2e35]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-fasting triglyceride-rich lipoproteins cholesterol (TRL-C) contributes to cardiovascular risk, in that it includes remnant cholesterol (RC). TRL-C is computed as total C - [LDL-C+HDL-C]. Such calculation applies only if LDL-C is directly measured, or obtained from a non-Friedewald's formula, a method as yet never benchmarked against independent markers of TRL burden.

Methods

The Discriminant Ratio (DR) methodology was used in 120 type 2 diabetic patients in order: (i) to compute TRL-C from non-fasting lipids; (ii) to establish the performance of TRL-C and TRL-C/apoA-I (vs. TG-based markers) to grade TRLs and atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD); and (iii) to relate TRL-C with non-fasting TG.

Results

Depending on apoB100 availability, TRL-C (mg/dL) can be derived from non-fasting lipids in two ways: (a) total cholesterol (TC) - [(0.0106 * TC - 0.0036 * TG+0.017 * apoB100 - 0.27) × 38.6] - HDL-C; and (b) TC - [(0.0106 * TC - 0.0036 * TG+0.017 * [0.65 * (TC - HDL-C)+6.3] - 0.27) × 38.6] - HDL-C. Discrimination between log[TG] and TRL-C was similar (DR 0.94 and 0.84, respectively), whereas that of log[TG]/HDL-C was better than TRL-C/apoA-I (DR 1.01 vs. 0.65; p 0.0482). All Pearson's correlations between pairs reached unity, allowing formulation of two unbiased equivalence equations: (a) TRL-C = 97.8 * log[TG] - 181.9; and (b) TRL-C/apoA-I = 8.15 * (log[TG]/HDL-C) - 0.18.

Conclusions

TRL-C and log[TG] are as effective and interchangeable for assessing remnant atherogenic particles. For grading TRL-AD, it is best to use log[TG]/HDL-C, inherently superior to TRL-C/apoA-I, while measuring the same underlying variable.

### Liraglutide treatment improves postprandial lipid metabolism and cardiometabolic risk factors in humans with adequately controlled type 2 diabetes: a single-centre randomized controlled study [^18f5ec3e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well established that high plasma concentrations of cholesterol‐rich atherogenic lipoproteins are causatively linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD). 1 However, despite treatments that significantly lower LDL concentrations, patients with type 2 diabetes and non‐alcoholic fatty‐liver disease (NAFLD) retain a considerable residual risk of CVD. 2, 3 There is, therefore, increasing interest in the role of plasma triglycerides, a biomarker of circulating triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (TRLs), and, in particular, their cholesterol‐rich remnant particles, with accumulating evidence that they are causatively linked to CVD. 4, 5 Of note, the residual risk of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes despite treatment with statins may be explained, in part, by the fact that these agents lower remnant cholesterol by only 4% to 25%, a point that is not normally noted as remnant cholesterol is not quantified by routine lipid measurements. 6

Remnant lipoprotein particles are derived from the intestine (ie, chylomicrons) and the liver (ie, VLDL). 6 The plasma concentration of these remnants is higher in patients with postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia, and non‐fasting triglyceride levels have allowed prediction of CVD risk more reliably than fasting triglyceride values. 7 Although the vast majority of plasma triglycerides after a fat‐rich mixed meal come from the intestine, 8 approximately 80% of the increase in particle number is accounted for by remnant particles derived from VLDL metabolism. 9 Intestinal‐derived chylomicron remnants and liver‐derived VLDL remnants are cleared from the circulation by common pathways and, therefore, compete for clearance. 10 Increased secretion of VLDL from the liver is, therefore, an important predictor of postprandial accumulation of chylomicron remnants. 11 We have also demonstrated that apoCIII is an important regulator of TRL remnant metabolism. 12

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) versus multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) — phenotype, risks, and diagnostic tools: Individuals with FCS typically have chylomicronemia with very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and do not develop premature cardiovascular disease, though some with additional risk factors accumulate atherogenic remnant particles that increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. A subgroup without biallelic pathogenic variants in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) machinery may show the clinical phenotypic characteristics of FCS and are sometimes classified as clinical FCS. Compared with FCS, MCS is at least 3 orders of magnitude more common; although TG levels are elevated, they are generally lower and more labile than in FCS, and MCS may arise from combinations of rare loss-of-function variants and secondary factors such as visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, ethanol consumption, suboptimal dietary composition, and certain medications; these factors can increase production and/or decrease clearance of TRL, and large very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons share a common catabolic pathway via LPL. MCS can present at any age, typically later than FCS, is often associated with lower risk for acute pancreatitis than FCS but sometimes is associated with extreme risk for pancreatitis, and patients with MCS generally have far higher ASCVD risk than those with FCS. In the absence of genetic testing, clinical diagnosis scoring systems (North American FCS Score Calculator; European FCS Score) have been developed to help differentiate FCS from MCS; two scores were tested and correlated fairly well with postheparin LPL activity, but they are designed to distinguish FCS from MCS rather than clinical outcome, and whether they improve care remains to be established.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes? [^955ee00d]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

TRIGLYCERIDES, HDL CHOLESTEROL, AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK

The question whether hypertriglyceridemia causes coronary artery disease (CAD) or is simply a marker for the accompanying lipoprotein abnormalities (especially low HDL cholesterol levels and small dense LDL particles) is still controversial. In a meta-analysis of 17 population-based prospective studies, increased plasma TG levels were associated with increased coronary disease risk in both men and women, after adjustment for HDL cholesterol and other risk factors. A direct atherogenic effect of TG-rich particles, particularly intermediate-density lipoprotein, and remnant particles has been presumed. In a more recent meta-analysis, adjustment for established coronary risk factors, especially HDL cholesterol, substantially attenuated the magnitude of risk associated with high TG levels, leaving an odds ratio of about 1.7 in individuals with TG levels in the top third of the population, compared with those in the bottom third.

Two recent studies shed light on the role of nonfasting TG levels as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the Women's Health Study, adjustment for levels of total and HDL cholesterol, and measures of insulin resistance (diabetes, BMI, and C-reactive protein), weakened the association between TG levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, leaving little independent relationship with cardiovascular events. In contrast, nonfasting TG levels were associated with incident cardiovascular events, independent of traditional risk factors, levels of other lipids, and markers of insulin resistance. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, nonfasting TG levels were associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and death after adjustment for age, total cholesterol, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, lipid-lowering therapy, postmenopausal status, and hormone therapy in women. The levels of nonfasting TG were highly correlated with those of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol. These results may also reflect the effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (independent of and cumulative to the effect of hyperglycemia) on endothelial function.

### Contribution of visceral adiposity to the exaggerated postprandial lipemia of men with impaired glucose tolerance [^591e5857]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) has been associated with alterations in numerous coronary heart disease risk factors, including postprandial hyperlipidemia. An excess visceral adipose tissue accumulation is also predictive of IGT and of an exaggerated postprandial lipemia. The objective of the present study was therefore to compare the respective contributions of visceral adipose tissue accumulation versus IGT with the variation in postprandial lipemia.

Research Design and Methods

Potential differences in postprandial triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein (TRL) levels following a standardized breakfast with a high fat content were examined among men characterized by normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or IGT. Sixty-seven men were classified according to their glucose tolerance status (< 7.8 mmol/l [NGT] or between 7.8 and 11.1 mmol/l [IGT] 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose test).

Results

Men with IGT showed the highest TRL-TG concentrations (P < 0.05) at the 4-, 6-, and 8-h time points compared with men with NGT. These higher postprandial TRL-TG levels among men with IGT were also accompanied by a greater postprandial TG total area under the incremental curve in all TRL fractions (large, medium, and small) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, subjects characterized by IGT had also the highest visceral adipose tissue accumulation (P < 0.009). When subgroups of IGT and NGT men were individually matched (n = 11) for similar visceral adipose tissue accumulation, no significant difference was found in postprandial responses of all TRL-TG fractions between the two groups.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence that visceral adipose tissue accumulation is an important factor involved in the deterioration of postprandial lipemia noted among men with IGT.

### Interaction between primary hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic implications [^bc1e501e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Those affected by MCS have an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, CVD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and DM. Secondary factors modulate the phenotypic severity. Recent findings have shown a higher prevalence of NASH in individuals with MCS compared to those with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) or moderate HTG, as reported in a study. This elevated prevalence of NASH in MCS cases is often associated with IR, MetS, and DM. Moreover, MCS precipitates a pro-atherogenic metabolic environment characterized by postprandial lipemia, making its management more complicated.

The association between MCS and DM is well documented, with reported prevalence rates in cohorts with severe HTG varying between 25 and 76%. This is particularly more notable in populations with additional secondary factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, and the use of TG-raising medications. Among these cohorts, individuals of Hispanic descent appear to be disproportionately affected. Notably, patients with DM with poor glycemic control are at higher risk for developing severe TG. Interestingly, the correlation between TG levels in affected individuals and those of their first-degree relatives is not consistent, given its multifactorial nature.

Poorly controlled DM contributes to HTG through several mechanisms. Firstly, it enhances the conversion of free fatty acids released from adipose tissue into TG. Additionally, it stimulates de novo lipogenesis in the liver, leading to increased production of TRL, thereby exacerbating the HTG. Finally, DM promotes overexpression of apoC-III, which results in lower LPL activity and prolonged lifetime of TRL. The impact of glucose-lowering therapy may often lead to a significant reduction in TG levels: however, this may not achieve TG target levels in all patients.

### The triglyceride-high-density lipoprotein axis: an important target of therapy? [^42e25cbe]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is the single largest cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The link between elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and coronary heart disease (CHD) has been clearly established. However, triglycerides (TG) are increasingly believed to be independently associated with CHD, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with CHD risk. High TG and low HDL often occur together, often with normal levels of LDL-C, and can be described as abnormalities of the TG-HDL axis. This lipid abnormality is a fundamental characteristic of patients with the metabolic syndrome, a condition strongly associated with the development of both type 2 diabetes and CHD. Patients with high TG and low HDL-C should be aggressively treated with therapeutic lifestyle changes. For high-risk patients, lipid-modifying therapy that specifically addresses the TG-HDL axis should also be considered. Current pharmacologic treatment options for such patients include statins, fibrates, niacin, fish oils, and combinations thereof. Several new pharmacologic approaches to treating the TG-HDL axis are currently being investigated. More clinical trial data is needed to test the hypothesis that pharmacologic therapy targeting the TG-HDL axis reduces atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.

### The small, dense LDL phenotype as a correlate of postprandial lipemia in men [^c24e3b4b]. Atherosclerosis (2000). Low credibility.

The atherogenic dyslipidemia of the insulin resistance syndrome is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTG), elevated apolipoprotein (apo) B levels, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations and by an increased proportion of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Although the hyperTG-low HDL cholesterol dyslipidemia has been associated with an impaired clearance of dietary fat, the contribution of the small, dense LDL phenotype as an independent predictor of postprandial triglyceride (TG) clearance remains uncertain. We have therefore compared the postprandial TG response among three subgroups of men characterized by small, intermediate or large LDL particles in a total sample of 69 men (mean age ± SD; 45.1 ± 10.5 years). To identify men with small versus large LDL particles, the first (LDL peak particle diameter < 251.9 A) and the third (> 257.6 A) tertiles of the distribution of LDL particle diameters were used as cutoff points. Men with small, dense LDL particles had the expected fasting dyslipidemic profile (high TG-low HDL cholesterol levels) compared to men with large, buoyant LDL particles. The oral lipid tolerance test revealed that men with small, dense LDL particles had significantly higher total-, large-, and medium-TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) responses to a fatty meal than men with large LDL particles (P < 0.03). In addition, within a subgroup of normolipidemic men (TG < 2.3 mmol/l and HDL cholesterol > 0.9 mmol/l), those with small, dense LDL particles had higher levels of total-, medium- and small-TRL responses compared to men with large, buoyant LDL particles (P < 0.05). Moreover, normotriglyceridemic men with small, dense LDL had higher levels of small-TRLs measured 8 h after the ingestion of the fat meal (P < 0.05) compared to normolipidemic men with large, buoyant LDL particles. Results of the present study suggest that the dense LDL phenotype may be an additional fasting marker of an exaggerated postprandial TG response and of an impaired clearance of TRLs.

### Contribution of postprandial lipemia to the dietary fat-mediated changes in endogenous lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations in humans [^0e92060e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary fats alter LDL and HDL cholesterol while serving as precursors of postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs).

Objective

We hypothesized that the saturated fatty acid (SFA)-mediated increase and the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-mediated decrease in endogenous lipoprotein cholesterol are promoted by postprandial TRLs.

Design

We performed a 16-d crossover diet study to examine the effect of PUFA-rich [ratio of PUFAs to SFAs (P:S) = 2.0] and SFA-rich (P:S = 0.25) diets on fasting and postprandial plasma lipid and lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations in 16 normolipidemic subjects.

Results

Fasting plasma cholesterol decreased significantly after a PUFA-rich diet because of a decrease in LDL (-12.3%; P < 0.05) and HDL (-3.8%; NS), but did not change after an SFA-rich diet. The appearance of postprandial TRLs in plasma at 4 h was linked to a significant lowering of both LDL (-7.4%) and HDL (-4.8%) after a PUFA-rich diet; no such effect was observed after the SFA-rich diet. At 7 h, LDL and HDL cholesterol returned to near fasting concentrations without postprandial TRL accumulation after a PUFA-rich diet but with a significant postprandial TRL accumulation after an SFA-rich diet. Thus, the in vivo postprandial clearance of cholesterol in LDL+HDL was greater after a PUFA-rich diet than after an SFA-rich diet. The appearance of postprandial TRLs in plasma increased the cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated transfer of cholesteryl ester from LDL+HDL to TRLs in vitro without a significant influence from dietary fat.

Conclusion

Dietary fat-mediated alterations in the rate of hepatic removal of postprandial TRLs, which carry cholesterol accepted from LDL+HDL via cholesteryl ester transfer protein in vivo, may contribute to the dietary fat-mediated change in endogenous lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Proteinuria decreases tissue lipoprotein receptor levels resulting in altered lipoprotein structure and increasing lipid levels [^f569326e]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Rats with nephrotic syndrome (NS) have a fivefold increase in lipids and a similar decrease in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) clearance. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is reduced both in NS and in the Nagase analbuminemic rat. These rats have nearly normal triglyceride levels and TRL clearance, suggesting that reduction in LPL alone is insufficient to cause increased TRL levels. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) was decreased in lipoprotein fractions in NS, but not in analbuminemia. Here we tested whether decreased apoE binding to lipoproteins in NS contributes to hyperlipidemia by decreasing their affinity for lipoprotein receptors. Plasma apoE was increased 60% in both NS and analbuminemia compared with control (CTRL) as a result of a 60% decreased apoE clearance. Very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein in NS had significantly less apoE per mole of phospholipid compared with analbuminemia or CTRL and significantly greater lipid content; however, apoE binding did not differ by lipoprotein class or group. There was a significant reduction of receptors for lipoproteins in nearly all tissues in NS compared with CTRL and analbuminemia. Thus, apoE within lipoprotein fractions was reduced by dilution resulting from expansion of the lipid fraction due to decreased lipolysis and not to differing affinity for apoE. Decreased lipoprotein receptors result from proteinuria and contribute to hyperlipidemia in NS.

### Comparative efficacy of pharmacological agents on reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in the hypertriglyceridemia population: a network meta-analysis [^9b4c64fe]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), a condition in which triglyceride levels are elevated (> 150 mg/dl [1.69 mmol/L]), is considered an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). According to Task Force recommendations, people with mild or moderate HTG (triglycerides between 150 mg/dl [1.69 mmol/L] and 999 mg/dl [11.3 mmol/L]) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with severe HTG (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl[11.3 mmol/L]) have an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Real-world data based on the CANHEART cohort showed that HTG was very common in the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease population, and elevated triglycerides (TGs) increased the risk of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs).

Serum TGs are the main components of chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). VLDLs and chylomicrons can permeate the arterial intima and selectively deposit, eventually causing the accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial intima and plaque formation. In addition, elevated TGs have an important effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis, inhibiting fibrinolysis, increasing blood viscosity, and promoting thrombosis. Therefore, HTG has a direct effect on atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of major cardiovascular events. For mild to moderate HTG (177 mg/dl [2.0 mmol/L] to 885 mg/dl [10.0 mmol/L]), statins are considered the first-line drug. Although statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to a greater extent than they reduce TGs, a small reduction in TGs may further reduce the residual risk of cardiovascular disease, which indicates the cardiovascular risk among statin-treated individuals. In addition to statins, lifestyle modifications, such as cessation of alcohol consumption, reduced intake of rapidly metabolized carbohydrates, weight loss, and blood sugar control are highly effective ways to lower TG levels. For many HTG patients, a further reduction in TGs may reduce the risk of residual cardiovascular disease. Therefore, guidelines recommend fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids if HTG persists despite the application of high-intensity statin therapy

### Atorvastatin reduces postprandial accumulation and cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated remodeling of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein subspecies in type IIb hyperlipidemia [^2ba5e27b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of atorvastatin, at 10 mg or 40 mg for 6 wk, on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism during the postprandial phase in subjects (n = 11) displaying type IIB hyperlipidemia was evaluated. The postprandial increment in area under the curve above baseline concentrations in type IIB subjects was significantly decreased by atorvastatin for plasma triglyceride (A10: -42% and A40: -55%, P < 0.01), chylomicrons (CMs) (A10: -24% and A40: -40%, P < 0.03) and VLDL-1 (A10: -54% and A40: -52%, P < 0.02). Before atorvastatin therapy, postprandial cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to CMs (2.5-fold; P < 0.005), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-1 (1.8-fold; P < 0.005), VLDL-2 (1.4-fold; P < 0.05), and intermediate-density lipoproteins (1.4-fold; P < 0.05) were significantly increased 4 h postprandially. Following statin treatment, the postprandial transfer of CE from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) at the 4-h time point was significantly reduced at 10 mg/d (-26%; P < 0.05) and at 40 mg/d (-24%; P < 0.05), compared with that before treatment. Such postprandial increase in CE transferred from HDLs to TRLs arose exclusively from accelerated CE transfer from HDLs to CMs (2.5-fold; P < 0.005). In conclusion, atorvastatin attenuates the abnormal intravascular remodeling of postprandial TRL particles via marked reduction in CE transfer in type IIB hyperlipidemia and diminishes the postprandial formation and accumulation of CMs and VLDL-1.

Thyroid and glucocorticoids — Thyroid hormone deficiency is associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels and there can also be an increase in triglyceride levels. Glucocorticoids affect lipoprotein metabolism by increasing cholesterol production via hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, increasing fatty acid synthesis via fatty acid synthase, and decreasing clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; elevated triglycerides can be seen in Cushing's syndrome as well as during glucocorticoid treatment.

### TRL, IDL, and LDL apolipoprotein B-100 and HDL apolipoprotein A-I kinetics as a function of age and menopausal status [^74e694dc]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine mechanisms contributing to the altered lipoprotein profile associated with aging and menopause, apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) and apoA-I kinetic behavior was assessed.

Methods and Results

Eight premenopausal (25 ± 3 years) and 16 postmenopausal (65 ± 6 years) women consumed for 6 weeks a standardized Western diet, at the end of which a primed-constant infusion of deuterated leucine was administered in the fed state to determine the kinetic behavior of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apoA-I. Data were fit to a multicompartmental model using SAAM II to calculate fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and production rate (PR). Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), TRL-C, and triglyceride levels were higher (50%, 55%, 130%, and 232%, respectively) in the postmenopausal compared with the premenopausal women, whereas HDL-C levels were similar. Plasma TRL, IDL, and LDL-apoB-100 levels and pool sizes (PS) were significantly higher in the postmenopausal than premenopausal women. These differences were accounted for by lower TRL, IDL, and LDL apoB-100 FCR (P < 0.05), with no difference in PR. There was no significant difference between groups in HDL-C levels or apoA-I kinetic parameters. Plasma TRL-C concentrations were negatively correlated with TRL apoB-100 FCR (r = -0.46; P < 0.05) and positively correlated with PR (r = 0.62; P < 0.01). Plasma LDL-C concentrations were negatively correlated with LDL apoB-100 FCR (r = -0.70; P < 0.001) but not PR.

Conclusions

The mechanism for the increase in TRL and LDL apoB-100 PS observed in the postmenopausal women was determined predominantly by decreased TRL and LDL catabolism rather than increased production. No differences were observed in HDL apoA-I kinetics between groups.

### The association between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, circulating leukocytes, and low-grade inflammation: the Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil) [^52fce0d9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Experimental studies have linked triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to inflammation, but the extent of this phenomenon in vivo has not been completely elucidated.

Objective

We investigated the association between TRL subparticles and inflammatory markers (circulating leukocytes, plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], and GlycA) in the general population.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional analysis of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). TRLs (number of particles per unit volume) and GlycA were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The association between TRLs and inflammatory markers was determined by multiple linear regression models adjusted for demographic data, metabolic conditions, and lifestyle factors. Standardized regression coefficients (beta) with 95% confidence intervals are reported.

Results

The study population comprised 4,001 individuals (54% females, age 50 ± 9 years). TRLs, especially medium and large subparticles, were associated with GlycA (beta 0.202 [0.168, 0.235], p < 0.001 for total TRLs). There was no association between TRLs and hs-CRP (beta 0.022 [-0.011, 0.056], p = 0.190). Medium, large, and very large TRLs were associated with leukocytes, with stronger connections with neutrophils and lymphocytes than monocytes. When TRL subclasses were analyzed as the proportion of the total pool of TRL particles, medium and large TRLs were positively related to leukocytes and GlycA, whereas smaller particles were inversely associated.

Conclusions

There are different patterns of association between TRL subparticles and inflammatory markers. The findings support the hypothesis that TRLs (especially medium and larger subparticles) may induce a low-grade inflammatory environment that involves leukocyte activation and is captured by GlycA, but not hs-CRP.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^6402661e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Exercise and triglycerides (TG) — training effects include that circulating TG levels frequently decline with exercise training to a degree that depends on baseline value, exercise energy expenditure, and timing of post-exercise measurement. In intervention trials, fasting TG have been lowered by 4 to 37% (approximate median reduction of 24%), and TG generally decline immediately after a session of high-volume endurance exercise and remain lower for up to 48 hours. The magnitude of TG decreases after a single exercise session before and after training is similar, i.e., 15 to 50%. Because benefits are transient without repeated bouts, exercise should be performed on a regular and uninterrupted basis to maintain a lower TG concentration, and changes in TG are highly correlated with changes in VLDL-C concentration.

### Pharmacologic approaches for the management of patients with moderately elevated triglycerides (150–499 mg / dL) [^61e10dba]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, now affects over one-quarter of the US adult population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Available guidelines for managing hypertriglyceridemia vary with respect to TG thresholds and severity of disease. Lifestyle modifications and management of secondary causes (eg, diabetes) remain the first step in managing hypertriglyceridemia, with pharmacotherapy reserved to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and/or further reduce TG levels. Several classes of lipid-lowering agents are available with variable TG-lowering efficacy. Although there is no consensus regarding the choice of initial TG-lowering pharmacotherapy, there is general agreement that the decision depends on the degree of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This review will discuss available and emerging lipid-lowering therapies for the management of moderately elevated TG, defined as TG 150 to 499 mg/dL.

### Triglycerides and residual atherosclerotic risk [^5e52f062]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A significant association between hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 150 mg/dl) and noncoronary atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation was identified in a group of apparently healthy persons with low to moderate CV risk, even in those persons with normal LDL-C levels. Our findings identify TG determination as a potential screening tool with therapeutic implications. These data reinforce the role of targeting hypertriglyceridemia in primary CV disease prevention. In light of these data, clinical guidelines could revisit their recommendations and consider a TG target of 150 mg/dl or lower for primary prevention for individuals at any level of CV risk, regardless of LDL-C concentration.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Serum TG levels are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation in persons with low to intermediate CV risk, irrespective of LDL-C level.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lowering blood TGs across a range of LDL-C levels on atherosclerosis progression and long-term clinical outcomes.

### Triglycerides and residual atherosclerotic risk [^d61c8148]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia includes a wide variety of biochemical disorders that have been linked to adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. Accumulated evidence shows that lifetime cumulative exposure to lipids has a clear impact on the risk of CV events. Early identification of atherogenic dyslipidemias, particularly in individuals at low to moderate CV risk (a large subset of patients), could guide interventions to improve primary prevention. Risk stratification can be further refined by characterizing identified plaques as inflamed or noninflamed.

Dyslipidemia leads to CV events by atherosclerotic plaque development and progression. Therefore, screening tools are needed to detect and characterize subclinical atherosclerosis and to design strategies to restratify CV risk and guide lifestyle and drug interventions. Among dyslipidemia factors, the main cause of atherosclerotic plaque development and subsequent CV events is considered to be low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although the evidence is less clear, other lipids are thought to contribute to atherosclerosis development, especially in the absence of high LDL-C levels. Adverse CV events have been linked to high levels of triglycerides (TGs). Current clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia recommend initiation of statins for serum TG levels > 200 mg/dl, but only in patients at high CV risk. More solid evidence is needed to guide clinical management of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly in individuals who are not at high CV risk according to current scales.

In this study, we investigated the association between serum TG and subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals without an indication for lipid-lowering interventions according to current guidelines (individuals at low to moderate CV risk and normal LDL-C levels).

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^e94c66b1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of severe hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia — TG clearance "saturates at plasma concentrations of ~500–700 mg/dL". When levels exceed this saturation threshold, "TG from new VLDL and chylomicron particles entering the circulation is removed very slowly, which can result in a marked elevation in circulating TGs and persistent chylomicronemia in the fasting state". Chylomicronemia "is not routinely measured in clinical settings because it requires specialized testing procedures", but "some chylomicron particles are present in the fasting state in patients with TG concentrations ≥ 750 mg/dL" and "significant chylomicronemia is present when the TG concentration exceeds 1000 mg/dL".

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^3a69e010]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia — mechanisms emphasize hepatic overproduction and impaired clearance: "In mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, there is typically overproduction of VLDL-TG by the liver". This is "often driven by excessive exposure of hepatocytes to free fatty acids", including from expanded abdominal/visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance. With high VLDL-TG production, VLDL particles are "enriched with Apo C3 and are Apo E deficient", leading to "impairment of TG clearance by LPL due to inhibition of LPL activity by Apo C3" and reduced hepatic uptake of remnants; consequently, "in most patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia, increased VLDL-TG output by the liver and impaired TG clearance are contributing factors".

Upon replicating our analysis using Labcorp technology, the findings were concordant with those previously mentioned obtained using Nightingale, as shown in Fig. 6. Analysis of Labcorp measurements confirmed the associations above between triglyceride-rich particles and total GDF-15, particularly between total GDF-15 and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in triglycerides and cholesterol (Fig. 6). These associations remained significant after the adjustment for the presence of the GDF-15 H202D variant.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes? [^c65a4b2a]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients remains high, despite modern effective therapies, such as statins. Some of the risk may be attributed to other components of the metabolic dyslipidemia, namely high TG level, low HDL cholesterol level, and small dense LDL. Current attempts at controlling this form of dyslipidemia have ended with either conflicting or entirely disappointing results. We are in dire need of additional therapeutic options for these high-risk patients. Ongoing trials with currently available therapies are expected to provide some much-needed answers, and new therapies are eagerly expected.

### Effects of bariatric surgery on hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein particle metabolism in obese, nondiabetic humans [^a3e9ccca]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The dyslipidemia of obesity and other insulin-resistant states is characterized by the elevation of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) of both hepatic (apoB-100-containing very low-density lipoprotein) and intestinal (apoB-48-containing chylomicrons) origin. Bariatric surgery is a well-established and effective modality for the treatment of obesity and is associated with improvements in several metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity, including a reduction in plasma triglycerides. Here, we have investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on TRL metabolism.

Approach and Results

Twenty-two nondiabetic, obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery: sleeve gastrectomy (n = 12) or gastric bypass (n = 10) were studied. Each subject underwent 1 lipoprotein turnover study 1 month before surgery followed by a second study, 6 months after surgery, using established stable isotope enrichment methodology, in constant fed state. TRL-apoB-100 concentration was significantly reduced after sleeve gastrectomy, explained by a decrease (P < 0.05) in TRL-apoB-100 production rate and an increase (P < 0.05) in TRL-apoB-100 fractional catabolic rate. TRL-apoB-48 concentration was also significantly reduced after sleeve gastrectomy, explained by reduction in TRL-apoB-48 production rate (P < 0.05). For gastric bypass, although TRL-apoB-100 concentration declined after surgery (P < 0.01), without a significant decline in TRL-apoB-48, there was no significant change in either TRL-apoB-100 or TRL-apoB-48 production rate or fractional catabolic rate. The reduction in TRL-apoB-100 concentration was significantly associated with a reduction in plasma apoC-III in the pooled group of patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Conclusions

This is the first human lipoprotein kinetic study to explore the mechanism of improvement of TRL metabolism after bariatric surgery. These effects may contribute to the decrease of cardiovascular mortality after surgery.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^4a932d65]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia in obesity — marked triglyceride elevations are often due to a "two hit" phenomenon of genetic predisposition plus secondary causes; contributors include unhealthy diet, alcohol, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, diabetes, certain medications, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism, pregnancy, increased delivery of fatty acids to the liver, and adiposopathic endocrinopathies and immunopathies. In obesity specifically, adipose tissue endocrinopathies and immunopathies increase triglyceride-rich lipoprotein production and decrease lipolysis, and adiposopathic impairment increases fatty acid flux to the liver, leading to increased hepatic VLDL production and increased circulating blood triglyceride levels.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^571040fe]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL :HDL ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). Niacin treatment also decreases serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of Lp(a), a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect requires further investigation. The effect of niacin-induced changes in lipids/proteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without preexisting coronary disease has not been established.23

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of TC, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

### Polygenic hyperlipidemias and coronary artery disease risk [^257263ae]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia, particularly high LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C), is an established, heritable, and treatable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that increased triglycerides (TGs; hypertriglyceridemia) are causally linked to CAD. –

Increased levels of both LDL-C and TGs result from a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. Genetic factors include rare highly penetrant variants and a long tail of common variants with smaller effect sizes. While pathogenic variants in the LDLR, PCSK9, and APOB genes cause familial hypercholesterolemia, it has also been suggested that similarly high LDL-C levels could result from a high polygenic burden of LDL-C–increasing variants. Monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia with an identified mutation associates with a higher CAD risk than expected on the basis of a single LDL-C measurement. While previous studies have linked a handful of common variants to both increased LDL-C and CAD risk, the contribution of an accumulation of a large number of LDL-C–increasing alleles to CAD risk has remained unknown.

Similarly to hypercholesterolemia, both polygenic burden and highly penetrant variants contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. However, highly penetrant variants underlying hypertriglyceridemia are much fewer and rare (estimated population prevalence, 1:1 000 000). On the contrary, many individuals with hypertriglyceridemia have a high polygenic burden of TG-increasing variants. Unlike LDL-C, it is unknown whether genetically increased TGs confer higher CAD risk than nongenetic hypertriglyceridemia. Genetics supporting a causal link between hypertriglyceridemia and CAD, and the evidence for beneficial therapeutic reducing of TGs to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, however, highlight the potential also for association between polygenic load of TG elevating alleles and CAD risk. –,

In this cohort study of 27 039 individuals from the Finnish National FINRISK Study (FINRISK) population cohort with lipid measurements, and 135 638 individuals including 13 753 CAD cases from the FinnGen project (FinnGen), we evaluated the impact of high polygenic LDL-C and TG to CAD risk. We developed separate genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for both LDL-C and TG to define polygenic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. First, we tested to what extent PRSs for LDL-C and TG associate with measured lipid levels. Second, we tested to what degree polygenic hypercholesterolemia and polygenic hypertriglyceridemia associate with increased risk for CAD.

### Gene-based elevated triglycerides and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in the women's genome health study [^a55a4ef1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective- Higher triglyceride (TG) is a risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but paradoxically, genetic susceptibility for higher TG has been associated with lower T2DM risk. There is also evidence that the genetic association may be modified by baseline TG. Whether such associations can be replicated and the interaction is selective for certain TG-rich lipoprotein particles remains to be explored. Approach and Results- Cox regression involving TG, TG-rich lipoprotein particles, and genetic determinants of TG was performed among 15813 participants with baseline fasting status in the WGHS (Women's Genome Health Study), including 1453 T2DM incident cases during a mean 18.6 (SD = 5.3) years of follow-up. A weighted, 40-single-nucleotide polymorphism TG genetic risk score was inversely associated with incident T2DM (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.66 [0.58–0.75]/10-TG risk alleles; P < 0.0001) with adjustment for baseline body mass index, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and TG. TG-associated risk was higher among individuals in the low compared with the high 40-single-nucleotide polymorphism TG genetic risk score tertile (hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.98 [1.83–2.14] versus 1.68 [1.58–1.80] per mmol/L; P interaction = 0.0007). In TG-adjusted analysis, large and medium but not small TG-rich lipoprotein particles were associated with higher T2DM incidence for successively lower 40-single-nucleotide polymorphism TG genetic risk score tertiles, P interaction = 0.013, 0.012, and 0.620 across tertiles, respectively. Conclusions- Our results confirm the previous observations of the paradoxical associations of TG with T2DM while focusing attention on the larger TG-rich lipoprotein particle subfractions, suggesting their importance in clinical profiling of T2DM risk.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^37e8fe81]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Adiposopathic dyslipidemia in obesity — lipid profile pattern and postprandial effects are commonly characterized by elevated triglycerides with reduced HDL-C, increased non-HDL-C, elevated apoB, increased LDL particle number, and increased small dense LDL particles; for non-lipid specialists, this is described as high blood triglyceride levels and low blood HDL-C levels, while blood LDL-C levels may be mildly increased. Postprandial hyperlipidemia with increases in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is also associated with ASCVD, with accumulation driven by overproduction and/or decreased catabolism and with predisposing factors including obesity and insulin resistance; acute postprandial increases in these particles and their remnants impair vasodilation and contribute to plaque rupture and thrombus formation.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^3e1a0bd7]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated
levels of total cholesterol (Total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (a membrane transport complex
for LDL-C) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A, are
associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations
have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with
the level of Total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins,
including VLDL, IDL and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated
plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and
small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk
factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not
consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore,
the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

In patients with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, treatment
with Lescol®(fluvastatin sodium) or Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) reduced Total-C, LDL-C,
apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides while producing an increase in HDL-C.
Increases in HDL-C are greater in patients with low HDL-C (< 35 mg/dL).
Neither agent had a consistent effect on either Lp(a) or fibrinogen. The effect
of Lescol or Lescol XL induced changes in lipoprotein levels, including
reduction of serum cholesterol, on cardiovascular mortality has not been
determined.

Dietary management — very high triglycerides (TG): For individuals with very high TG (≥ 500 mg/dL), nutrition therapy will differ from the management of TG < 500 mg/dL; plasma TG are mainly transported by 2 distinct classes of lipoproteins — 1) chylomicrons produced and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and 2) very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesized in the liver.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a216e324]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and estrogen exposures — During pregnancy, owing to estrogen-induced hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein, triglyceride levels increase progressively, with levels in the third trimester increased by 200% or more over levels before pregnancy; in women with underlying triglyceride disorders, this can result in a risk of pancreatitis with potential fetal loss. Oral estrogen (estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives) has a triglyceride-increasing effect due to increased hepatic VLDL production, an effect that does not occur with transdermal estrogen. Tamoxifen can also increase triglyceride levels, and although the effect is less pronounced with raloxifene, it can increase levels in women predisposed to hypertriglyceridemia.

Atherogenic dyslipidaemia risk triad: triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and small, dense LDL

LDL-C is contained in heterogeneous particles which range in size and composition from a small, dense, triglyceride (TG) rich LDL (sdLDL) to a large, buoyant, cholesterol-enriched LDL (lbLDL). This distinction between LDL particle subclasses is important because sdLDL, unlike lbLDL, is a component of an atherogenic dyslipidaemia risk triad (ADRT), composed of elevated levels of TGs and sdLDL, in conjunction with low levels of HDL. Each of the three components of the ADRT, individually, has been associated with increased risk of CHD. For example, sdLDL, unlike lbLDL, is a unique marker of CHD risk, independent of LDL-C. Another study demonstrated that FH individuals, distinguished solely on the basis of having high TGs (> 200 mg/dL), exhibited three times greater occurrence of a myocardial infarction (MI), compared with FH individuals with low TGs (< 200 mg/dL). It is noteworthy that the association of high levels of TGs in FH with a high rate of MI occurrence was independent of their LDL-C levels (figure 1). Overall, the ADRT is a highly reliable measure of CHD risk in FH, as well as non-FH, individuals.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^1141078f]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia in adults — For individuals with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in the 500 to 884 mg/dL range, ASCVD prevention remains a priority, but attention should be given to the reduction of TG levels to decrease the individual's risk of HTG-induced acute pancreatitis; this is particularly true when TG levels reach the 885 to 1000 mg/dL threshold. Alcohol should be avoided in individuals with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, and at TG ≥ 885 mg/dL the risk of pancreatitis rises substantially and will require a severe restriction in dietary fat intake. There should be an immediate restriction in dietary fat intake to < 15 to 20 grams per day; if this degree of reduction is needed to chronically maintain TGs < 885 mg/dL, medium-chain TGs (MCT) and essential fatty acid supplements can be added to the diet to avoid nutritional deficiencies. Effective implementation of lifestyle measures aimed at lowering TG will have a very noticeable effect in a short space of time (weeks). Most adults with TG levels ≥ 885 to 1000 mg/dL present with the polygenic form of the chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) and retain partial or full LPL activity, and these individuals will be able to maintain TG levels < 250 mg/dL with addressing secondary factors, a moderate restriction of dietary fat (25–30% calories from fat, ideally < 40–50 grams of fat/day) and the use of TG-lowering medications; diets with fat content of ≤ 15 to 20 grams of fat per day are needed in individuals with persisting chylomicronemia who have FCS or a refractory form of MCS.

### Effect of ezetimibe on the in vivo kinetics of apoB-48 and apoB-100 in men with primary hypercholesterolemia [^7da26528]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the impact of ezetimibe, a selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, on the in vivo kinetics of apolipoproteins (apo) B-48 and B-100 in humans.

Methods and Results

Kinetics of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apoB-48 and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100 labeled with a stable isotope were assessed at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks of treatment with 10 mg/d of ezetimibe in 8 men with moderate primary hypercholesterolemia. Data were fit to a multicompartmental model using SAAMII to calculate fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and production rate (PR). Ezetimibe significantly decreased total and LDL cholesterol concentrations by -14.5% and -22.0% (P = 0.004), respectively, with no significant change in plasma triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe had no significant effect on TRL apoB-48 kinetics and pool size (PS). However, VLDL and IDL apoB-100 FCRs were significantly increased (+31.2%, P = 0.02 and +20.8%, P = 0.04, respectively) with a concomitant elevation of VLDL apoB-100 PR (+20.9%, P = 0.04). Furthermore, LDL apoB-100 PS was significantly reduced by -23.2% (P = 0.004), caused by a significant increase in FCR of this lipoprotein fraction (+24.0%, P = 0.04).

Conclusions

These results indicate that reduction of plasma LDL cholesterol concentration after treatment with ezetimibe is associated with an increase in FCR of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^9e5c0365]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertriglyceridemia:

- **Definition**: Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: Underlying pathophysiology occurs through abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production, and intestinal chylomicron synthesis; dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or impaired remnant clearance. Primary etiology includes genetic mutations (LPL, APOC3, APOA5 genes), while secondary etiologies may consist of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcohol use, renal disease, pregnancy, and MASLD.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US is estimated at 29% in men and 21% in women.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, lipemia retinalis, tuberous xanthoma, palmar crease xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, focal neurologic symptoms (irritability), and recurrent epigastric pain with an increased risk of pancreatitis seen mostly with both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, T2DM, and acute pancreatitis with a reduction in health-related QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypertriglyceridemia with high (150–500 mg/dL) and very high levels (> 500 mg/dL) is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with hazard ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.36–1.63, p < 0.001) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.46–6.50, p < 0.01), respectively.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^41467b55]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Weight loss — effects on triglycerides (TG) indicate that even modest loss lowers TG; "a small (3–5%) reduction in body weight can lower TG", and "a 5–10% weight loss would be expected to lower TG by approximately 20%". A "strong association has been demonstrated between TG and weight, elevated BMI, and visceral fat".

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^27934fbb]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — potential causes and lifestyle nutrition interventions by triglycerides (TG) level — are outlined with causes including autoimmune disorders, diabetes/metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, and pregnancy (especially third trimester), and interventions stratified by TG < 500 mg/dL, TG 500–749 mg/dL, and TG ≥ 750 mg/dL. For added sugars, the table specifies Reduce, Markedly reduce, and Eliminate across these strata; total fat for TG < 500 mg/dL is 25–35% of total daily energy; alcohol is Restrict for TG < 500 mg/dL and Abstain completely for TG 500–749 mg/dL and TG ≥ 750 mg/dL; aerobic activity is ≥ 150 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or equivalent); and the recommended weight loss goal is 5–10% for patients with increased adiposity. For chylomicronemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia management, the text states that initially, a very-low-fat (< 5% total daily energy) diet should be recommended to resolve chylomicronemia and reduce the risk of pancreatitis, with TG levels closely monitored; once TG levels are < 750 mg/dL, individualization is essential, and some patients may require a diet with < 20% total daily energy from fat to maintain TG levels < 750 mg/dL; after pregnancy, the nutrition intervention should be further individualized based on the TG level; and patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) will require a very-low-fat diet (< 15–20 g/d) for life.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^f284e7ce]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^5c8cc94c]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.
