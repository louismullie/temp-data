## Question

Fungal under wood lamp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret fungal findings under a Wood's lamp. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Wood's lamp actually detects and the principle of fluorescence. Then, I should categorize which fungal entities show characteristic fluorescence and which do not. Next, I will review the key non-fungal mimics that can mislead clinicians, especially erythrasma and progressive macular hypomelanosis. After that, I need to verify the limitations and pitfalls of Wood's lamp, including false positives and negatives. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm that integrates Wood's lamp with KOH microscopy, culture, and trichoscopy when appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the physical principle. A Wood's lamp emits long-wave ultraviolet A (320–400 nm), and certain porphyrins and other metabolites absorb UV and emit visible light, producing fluorescence. This is why erythrasma shows coral-red due to coproporphyrin III, while Malassezia in pityriasis versicolor may emit yellow-green to copper-orange hues, though fluorescence is variable and not guaranteed [^11192KZ9] [^114nqo4T] [^111hVTwr].

> I will now examine fungal entities with characteristic Wood's lamp fluorescence. Hold on, let me verify the classic pattern: tinea capitis due to Microsporum canis or M. audouinii typically shows bright blue-green fluorescence, reflecting tryptophan metabolites. This is historically taught and still useful when positive, though it is less common in contemporary practice where Trichophyton tonsurans predominates and does not fluoresce [^1175755H] [^115sY3gr] [^112rEJRZ]. For pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia may yield yellow-green to copper-orange fluorescence, but I need to emphasize variability and that a negative Wood's lamp does not exclude the diagnosis, so microscopy remains essential [^111hVTwr] [^115BFQS8].

> Wait, let me verify non-fluorescent dermatophytes. Most Trichophyton species, including T. tonsurans and T. rubrum, do not fluoresce, so a negative Wood's lamp cannot rule out tinea capitis or tinea corporis; this is a critical limitation that explains why many modern cases are Wood's-negative despite clear infection on KOH or culture [^1175755H] [^114XDoqM].

> Next, I should review non-fungal mimics that fluoresce and can mislead. Erythrasma, caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum, produces coproporphyrin III and shows coral-red fluorescence in intertriginous sites; it is bacterial, not fungal, and responds to antibacterial therapy rather than antifungals, so I need to ensure I don't misclassify it as a fungal infection based on color alone [^11192KZ9] [^114nqo4T] [^112r2QeJ]. Progressive macular hypomelanosis exhibits perifollicular red-orange fluorescence under Wood's lamp due to porphyrins from Propionibacterium acnes; again, this is bacterial colonization rather than a fungal process, and the Wood's pattern can be pathognomonic when recognized [^114Q1THa] [^111Qsw3m].

> Hold on, I should verify other bacterial hair infections. Trichobacteriosis (formerly trichomycosis) of axillary or pubic hair can show yellow, red, or black concretions with yellowish-green fluorescence in some cases, reflecting corynebacterial porphyrins; this is another non-fungal entity where Wood's lamp can assist diagnosis and guide antibacterial management [^116rnspV].

> I need to check for pitfalls and confounders. False positives can occur when topical products, highlighters, or other exogenous materials fluoresce, mimicking disease; I should double-check for cosmetics or medications on the skin before concluding there is pathologic fluorescence [^115RLQzW]. Conversely, false negatives are common with non-fluorescing dermatophytes and with low bacterial burden or prior cleansing, so a negative Wood's lamp should never reassure me if clinical suspicion is high [^1175755H] [^111hVTwr].

> Let me consider the diagnostic yield and when to escalate. Wood's lamp is rapid and noninvasive, but its sensitivity and specificity are limited and context-dependent. For suspected tinea, KOH microscopy remains the first-line confirmatory test in clinic, with culture when needed, and trichoscopy can rapidly support tinea capitis by identifying comma or corkscrew hairs while we await culture results [^112QJyqZ] [^114nwB5i] [^113MrKjr]. I should confirm that Malassezia in pityriasis versicolor shows short, wide hyphal fragments with large, thick-walled yeasts on KOH, which distinguishes pathogenic colonization from commensal yeast forms and aligns with the variable Wood's fluorescence seen clinically [^115BFQS8].

> But wait, what if the Wood's lamp shows coral-red in the axilla or groin? I should reconsider erythrasma and avoid reflex antifungals. Instead, I would favor topical clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, or a short macrolide course for extensive disease, and I can use Wood's lamp to monitor treatment response as fluorescence diminishes with bacterial clearance [^11192KZ9] [^112r2QeJ] [^114nqo4T].

> Next, I should review a practical algorithm. If fluorescence is bright blue-green on the scalp, I can suspect Microsporum tinea capitis and proceed with KOH and culture while starting appropriate systemic therapy. If there is no fluorescence but clinical features suggest tinea, I should not delay KOH and culture because T. tonsurans is common and non-fluorescent. If yellow-green to copper-orange fluorescence appears on the trunk, I consider pityriasis versicolor and confirm with KOH. If coral-red fluorescence appears in intertriginous areas, I diagnose erythrasma and treat with antibacterials. If perifollicular red-orange fluorescence is seen on the trunk or back, I think PMH and consider antibacterial regimens targeting P. acnes [^1175755H] [^111hVTwr] [^11192KZ9] [^114Q1THa].

> In summary, I need to ensure I interpret Wood's lamp findings through the lens of expected porphyrin fluorescence patterns, remember that many important dermatophytes do not fluoresce, and always correlate with KOH microscopy and, when necessary, culture or trichoscopy. That disciplined approach prevents misdiagnosis and ensures timely, pathogen-directed therapy [^1167CVQU] [^112QJyqZ] [^113MrKjr].

Under Wood's lamp, **fungal infections show characteristic fluorescence**: tinea capitis due to Microsporum species fluoresces bright green [^1175755H], tinea versicolor shows yellow-green to copper-orange [^111hVTwr], and erythrasma (Corynebacterium minutissimum) glows coral-red [^114nqo4T] [^11192KZ9]. Trichophyton species **do not fluoresce** [^1175755H], so a negative Wood's lamp does not exclude fungal infection [^114XDoqM]. Wood's lamp is a rapid, noninvasive screening tool, but **confirm diagnosis with KOH prep and culture** when results are inconclusive or the clinical picture is unclear [^112QJyqZ] [^114nwB5i].

## Fungal infections detectable by Wood's lamp

Several fungal infections exhibit characteristic fluorescence under Wood's lamp, including:

| **Fungal infection** | **Characteristic fluorescence** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Tinea capitis (Microsporum spp.) | Bright green | - Scalp lesions <br/> - Hair loss <br/> - Scaling [^1175755H] |
| Tinea versicolor (Malassezia spp.) | Yellow-green to copper-orange | - Hypo- or hyperpigmented macules <br/> - Trunk and proximal limbs [^111hVTwr] |
| Erythrasma (Corynebacterium minutissimum) | Coral-red | - Chronic superficial bacterial infection <br/> - Intertriginous areas [^114nqo4T] |

## Limitations and false results

While Wood's lamp examination is useful, it has limitations:

- **False positives**: Certain topical medications, cleansers, or skin conditions may fluoresce, leading to false-positive results [^115RLQzW].

- **False negatives**: Some fungal infections, particularly those caused by Trichophyton species, do not fluoresce under Wood's lamp, resulting in false-negative results [^1175755H].

- **Limited specificity**: Wood's lamp cannot reliably distinguish between different fungal species or differentiate fungal infections from other skin conditions [^114XDoqM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Wood's lamp examination should be supplemented with confirmatory tests such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and fungal culture for accurate diagnosis [^114XDoqM].

- **Clinical correlation**: Results of Wood's lamp examination should always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and patient history [^notfound].

- **Adjunctive tool**: Wood's lamp is best used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool rather than a standalone method for diagnosing fungal infections [^114XDoqM].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment considerations

Positive Wood's lamp findings have important clinical implications:

- **Early diagnosis**: Wood's lamp examination allows for early detection and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy, reducing the risk of complications and transmission [^114XDoqM].

- **Monitoring treatment response**: Wood's lamp can be used to monitor treatment response, as successful therapy typically results in the disappearance of characteristic fluorescence [^112r2QeJ].

- **Patient education**: Positive findings provide an opportunity to educate patients about hygiene practices and preventive measures to avoid recurrence [^114WZD29].

---

Wood's lamp examination is a **useful, rapid, and noninvasive** screening tool for detecting fungal infections. It shows characteristic fluorescence in tinea capitis, tinea versicolor, and erythrasma, but has limitations — including false positives and negatives — and cannot reliably distinguish between different fungal species. Therefore, **confirmatory tests such as KOH preparation and fungal culture are essential** for accurate diagnosis and management [^111wddq7] [^114XDoqM].

### Oral fluconazole in the treatment of tinea versicolor [^1135sAuz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral fluconazole given at 300 mg once weekly for two weeks in the treatment of tinea versicolor. Enrolled into the study were 44 subjects with tinea versicolor, provisionally confirmed by the detection of fungal hyphae in KOH wet mounts and Wood's lamp examination. Four subjects were classified as dropouts because no information was obtained from them after the baseline visit. Subjects were treated for two weeks orally with fluconazole 300 mg weekly and followed at the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 12th weeks of treatment. The study included 40 subjects (26 males and 14 females, mean age 29 years, range 19–48 years). At the week 4 visit, 30 (75%) patients showed a complete cure and 31 (77.5%) patients showed mycologic cure. Ten (25%) patients had no significant response to therapy. At the final follow-up visit (week 12), none of the patients showing complete or mycologic cures exhibited a recurrence. No adverse effects were observed in any of the patients treated. We believe that, due to the low incidence of side effects, shorter treatment duration, and increased adaptation of the patients, fluconazole can be used in the treatment of tinea versicolor with confidence.

### Figurate annulare erythemas [^111YETBA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

T. Colcott Fox (1849–1916) first introduced in 1889 the term "figurate erythemas". According to the clinical pattern, figurate erythemas are annular, circinate, concentric, polycyclic, or arciform. The most important figurate annulare erythemas are erythema annulare centrifugum, erythema marginatum, erythema gyratum repens, erythema migrans, erythema chronicum migrans, and the pediatric annular erythemas. Erythema annulare centrifugum might be due to fungal, bacterial, or viral infections or drugs. It tends to spread centrifugally while developing central clearing. The most common locations are the trunk and the proximal extremities. Individual lesions last from several days to weeks and may resolve spontaneously. Erythema marginatum is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever, but it also might be seen as a symptom of other diseases such as hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency and psittacosis. The typical clinical picture is presented by serpiginous erythematous macules and plaques with central clearing and accentuated borders. Erythema gyratum repens is a figurate erythema associated with internal malignancy. It has been linked especially to lung, esophageal, and breast cancers. Erythema gyratum repens is characterized by multiple erythematous, rounded macules or papules, rapidly progressing and forming concentric bands with an unique wood-grained appearance with desquamation on the edges of the erythema. Erythema chronicum migrans is the most common sign of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and other Borrelia species. It is characterized by a round or oval erythematous or livid macule with a central depressed or raised area on the spot of a previous tick bite. Erythema migrans grows centrifugally and slowly in a matter of days or weeks. Central clearing is observed in 60% of patients, thus forming a targetoid appearance of the lesion. Many other figurate erythemas can be observed in infancy (pediatric annular erythemas). To this group belong neonatal lupus, erythema gyratum atrophicans transiens neonatale, annular centrifugal erythema, familial annular erythema, annular erythema of infancy, eosinophilic annular erythema, and figurate neutrophilic erythema of infancy. The treatment of the various types of figurate erythemas should be etiologic, and when the underlying condition is addressed, the therapy usually is successful.

### Fluorescence microscopy as a diagnostic tool for dermatophytosis [^111SoYCY]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal infection of keratinized tissues. Dermatophytes can cause discomfort but are not usually life threatening. However, the infection can spread and may lead to systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Currently available diagnostic methods include potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. However, most diagnostic techniques cannot be performed rapidly; days to weeks may be required for conclusive results. Certain dermatophytes autofluoresce and can be observed under fluorescence microscopy. The authors examined a series of 24 cases of hematoxylin and eosin-stained dermatophytoses using fluorescence microscopy and compared the results with those obtained using PAS staining. The diagnostic performance of fluorescence microscopy was better than that of PAS staining. Fluorescence microscopy allowed the detection of all the cases that were detected using PAS staining. In addition, fluorescence microscopy facilitated the detection of weak fluorescence in 2 cases with ambiguous PAS results. These results support the integration into clinical practice of fluorescence microscopy as a simple and rapid diagnostic tool for evaluating cases of suspected dermatophytosis.

### Direct microscopy in the dermatology clinic: enhancing the management of skin infections and infestations [^115BFQS8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Malassezia yeasts are responsible for the common condition pityriasis versicolor. Culturing the organism is not helpful as Malassezia yeasts frequently make up part of the normal skin flora. Direct microscopy of skin confirms the diagnosis if short fragments of wide hyphae are found together with large thick‐walled spherical yeasts (Fig. 4b). It is the presence of hyphae that confirms the pathogenic phase of the organism in this condition in contrast to isolated yeast forms, which can be detected on normal skin, although rarely, infections showing oval yeast forms alone can be seen. Malassezia folliculitis is a distinct condition often characterized by an abundance of yeast forms within the hair follicles. Hyphal forms are rarely observed, and the diagnosis is made by observing typical clinical lesions in combination with yeast forms under direct microscopy.

A proportion of skin and nail infections seen in the UK will be caused by nondermatophyte moulds. Infection with Neoscytalidium dimidiatum and Neoscytalidium hyalinum are common in the tropics, and can be seen in the UK in patients who have migrated from endemic countries. Infection can cause nail dystrophy with dark discolouration, and involvement of palmoplantar skin mimicking the dry‐type T. rubrum infection. KOH preparations of skin or nail may reveal hyphae of uneven width; however, they often resemble dermatophyte hyphae. N. dimidiatum hyphae can be pigmented in situ. The condition shows a poor response to all antifungal treatments. Scopulariopsis causes nail infection, resulting in a brown and crumbly appearance of the nail. KOH preparation may reveal characteristic lemon‐shaped conidia. Other nondermatophyte hyphal organisms causing nail infection include Aspergillus, Fusarium and Acremonium species. These organisms may be indicated by a clinical presentation of SWO, and/or the observation on direct examination of irregular hyphae with extensive branching and fronding.

### An underestimated pathogen: species [^116rnspV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue abscess

C. amycolatum, C. diphtheriae complex, C. pyruviciproducens, C. striatum, and C. ulcerans have been known to cause skin and soft tissue abscesses. In addition to GLM, C. kroppenstedtii can cause breast abscesses. These are often recurring and can be challenging to treat.

Trichobacteriosis

This infection was previously termed trichomycosis when the causative agent was thought to be fungal. With the recent knowledge that its etiology is likely bacterial, trichobacteriosis is now the preferred name for this dermatological condition. The majority of cases are associated with Corynebacterium spp. It is a benign infection of hair follicles. It most often involves axillary hair; however, pubic and scalp hair may also be involved. Bacterial concretions adhering to hair shafts may lead to thickening of the hair or a change in hair coloration, most commonly to yellow, but red and black coloration may be seen. Under UV fluorescence, the hair follicles may have a neon yellowish-green coloration if caused by C. flavescens. Similar to erythrasma, the use of a Wood's lamp may aid in diagnosis. Treatment with topical antibiotics or shaving the affected hair is generally effective.

### Perialar intertrigo in children and adolescents: a multicenter prospective study of 41 cases [^114LYTvr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Facial dermatoses in children and adolescents are among the main reasons for consultation in pediatric dermatology. Of these, acne, which affects 65.8% of European teenagers, is the most frequentand often results in a request for therapy. Other facial dermatoses observed in this age group are atopic dermatitis, rosacea, periorificial dermatitis, granulomatosis periorificial dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis.

We have observed cases of isolated erythema of the nasal folds in pediatric dermatology practice. To our knowledge, this has not been previously described in the literature. In our experience, this intertrigo was sometimes associated with a follicular orange‐red fluorescence in the same perinasal area under Wood's lamp examination. This condition appeared refractory to various topical therapies. To better characterize this undescribed skin manifestation, we performed a prospective, observational, multicentre study. Herein, we describe the clinical characteristics of this dermatosis.

### Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea nigra, and piedra [^114WZD29]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are among the most common dermatologic conditions throughout the world. To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.

Abstract

Background/Objectives

We observed isolated cases of perialar intertrigo in children and teenagers that did not appear to correspond to any known clinical entity. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features of this dermatosis and the clinical characteristics of the patients.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in France from August 2017 to November 2019. All the patients under 18 years of age with chronic perinasal intertrigo were included. A standardized questionnaire detailing the clinical characteristics of the patients and the description of the intertrigo. If possible, a Wood's lamp examination of the intertrigo was done.

Results

Forty‐one patients were included (25 boys and 16 girls, average age: 12.1 years). Intertrigo was bilateral in 38 patients (93%). The majority of patients had no symptoms (54%). Pruritus was present in 39% of cases. Orange red follicular fluorescence was present in the perialar region on Wood's light examination in 78% of cases with active fluorescence. The presumptive diagnoses suggested by the investigators were acne (24.4%), seborrheic dermatitis (19.5%), rosacea (9.8%), psoriasis (9.8%) and perioral dermatitis (7.3%). No diagnosis was proposed in 22% of the cases.

Conclusions

We describe a previously undescribed clinical sign which is characterized by a chronic bilateral erythematous intertrigo located in the perialar region. It can be isolated or associated with various facial dermatoses.

Question 1: Based on the histological and clinical presentation, what is the most likely underlying diagnosis?
A. Sarcoidosis
B. Leishmaniasis
C. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma
D. Histoplasmosis
E. Xanthelasma

Answers:
A. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Cutaneous sarcoidosis may present as firm, erythematous nodules that occur most frequently in facial areas. The typical histological presentation of sarcoid skin lesions involve non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes, often accompanied by a rim of lymphocytes in the surrounding. Unlike other granulomas seen in infections or autoimmune diseases, granulomas in sarcoidosis have a relatively low number of lymphocytes, why they are also called "naked granulomas". The absence of granulomas in histology excludes this diagnosis.
B. Leishmaniasis – Correct. Histopathology consistent with numerous amastigotes in the cytoplasm of macrophages prompted us to perform molecular analyses, which confirmed infection with Leishmania infantum. As chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound – to exclude systemic involvement – remained inconspicuous, the patient was diagnosed with non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL). Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania species. Species of phlebotomine sandflies are the main vectors of transmission. The clinical appearance of cutaneous lesions is highly heterogeneous, ranging from solitary plaques to multiple, ulcerated, or heavily scaling tumors.
C. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma – Incorrect. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma typically show yellowish plaques or nodules. Characteristic histologic features are necrobiotic areas and a granulomatous inflammation as well as the presence of Touton giant cells. The absence of scaling is typical. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma are often located around the eyes, which fits well with the lesion in the case. However, it can be ruled out histologically due to the intracellular inclusions in macrophages that are present.
D. Histoplasmosis – Incorrect. Histoplasmosis, a fungal infection, is characterized by macrophages with intracellular yeasts in histology. Clinically, cutaneous histoplasmosis may present as papules, plaques, or ulcers, often resembling other granulomatous conditions. Specifically in patients with immunosuppression, cases can be severe, leading to chronic or/and disseminated skin lesions. In this case, however, due to negative Grocott and PAS stains, fungal pathogens could be ruled out.
E. Xanthelasma – Incorrect. Xanthelasma, a benign skin condition, is characterized by yellowish, cholesterol-rich plaques. Eyelids are considered a predilection site for the occurrence of xanthelasma. Typically, the lesions appear in a yellow color, which can be explained by the presence of macrophages filled with lipid, so called "foamy histiocytes". As there was no infiltration with foamy histiocytes, xanthelasma can be excluded as a correct diagnosis.

### Nonpruritic hypopigmented macules on an immunocompromised patient [^112stCnP]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. AEV – Correct. AEV manifests with diffuse, polygonal, hypopigmented macules, papules, or plaques with a "flat wart"-like or PV-like appearance. Histological findings include epidermal acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and enlarged cells with bluish-gray cytoplasm and cleared out nuclei, perinuclear halos, and variably prominent keratohyalin granules. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a condition that can be inherited or acquired. In the acquired form, it affects patients with deficient cell-mediated immunity due to infection (eg, HIV), malignancy, medications, or organ transplantation.
B. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Lichen planus is characteristically pruritic and pink or violaceous in color with overlying Wickham striae. Histopathologic findings include a lichenoid interface tissue reaction, a distinctive saw-tooth pattern, and hypergranulosis.
C. PV – Incorrect. PV presents with hypopigmented macules with fine, whitish scale. Yellow fluorescence on Wood's lamp test and the presence of hyphae and spores on KOH are typical.
D. Darier disease – Incorrect. Darier disease presents with small, symmetric, skin-colored to yellow-brown papules found in a seborrheic distribution. They are often greasy, firm, and emit a strong odor. Histopathology is characterized by acantholytic and dyskeratotic cells represented as "corps ronds and grains".
E. Verruca plana – Incorrect. Verruca plana are small flat-topped brownish or skin-colored papules mostly located on the face, back of the hands, and shins. These are commonly associated with human papillomavirus 3 (HPV-3) and HPV-10. Orthokeratosis, mild acanthosis, slight papillomatosis, and prominent koilocytes in the granular layer are typical features.

### An alternate light source to detect semen [^1177BAmq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The Wood's lamp (WL) has been used in sexual assault evaluations. Recent data have shown that semen does not fluoresce with a WL and that physicians are unable to differentiate semen from other common medicaments using a WL.

Objectives

To determine whether physicians could differentiate semen from other products using an alternate light source (ALS), and to investigate whether a brief training period with the ALS would enhance physicians' ability to differentiate between semen and other commonly used products.

Methods

An ALS, Bluemaxx BM500, was found to cause semen to fluoresce. Physicians were first asked to use this ALS to identify semen and then to distinguish between a semen sample and other products. Physicians then received a training class on the use of the ALS and were then asked to differentiate semen from other products.

Results

All physicians identified the semen as fluorescing and 25% successfully differentiated the semen from the other products using the ALS. Products most commonly mistaken for semen were a hand cream, Castille soap, and bacitracin. After the training session, 83% of the physicians successfully differentiated the semen from other products. The ALS, while not specific for semen identification, was 100% sensitive for it.

Conclusions

Physicians instructed in the use of an alternate light source (BM 500) are able to identify semen as fluorescing and can differentiate semen (after a training session) from other commonly used products.

### Topical treatment of common superficial tinea infections [^1138Uspt]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Tinea infections are superficial fungal infections caused by three species of fungi collectively known as dermatophytes. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet). Accurate diagnosis is necessary for effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical appearance plus direct microscopy of a potassium hydroxide preparation. Culture or histologic examination is rarely required for diagnosis. Treatment requires attention to exacerbating factors such as skin moisture and choosing an appropriate antifungal agent. Topical therapy is generally successful unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. In these cases, systemic therapy may be required. Tinea corporis and cruris infections are usually treated for two weeks, while tinea pedis is treated for four weeks with an azole or for one to two weeks with allylamine medication. Treatment should continue for at least one week after clinical clearing of infection. Newer medications require fewer applications and a shorter duration of use. The presence of inflammation may necessitate the use of an agent with inherent anti-inflammatory properties or the use of a combination antifungal/steroid agent. The latter agents should be used with caution because of their potential for causing atrophy and other steroid-associated complications.

### Erythrasma in 4 skin of color patients with hidradenitis suppurativa [^112kfnwL]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 3

A 23-year-old Black woman presented for a follow-up of severe HS of many years. The patient had a disease of the axillae, inguinal folds, abdomen, labia majora, and perineum that had been managed with secukinumab (after failing treatment with infliximab and adalimumab), intralesional triamcinolone, and aggressive surgical debridement. Physical examination revealed ulcers of bilateral inguinal creases (consistent with erosive HS) and well-defined erythematous scaly plaques of the lower abdomen and inguinal folds (Fig 3), consistent with erythrasma. Wood's lamp revealed coral-red fluorescence. The erythrasma responded to clindamycin 1% lotion, applied twice daily for 1 month.

### The diagnosis of onychomycosis [^112zghM4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing and the primary pathogens may be dermatophytes, nondermatophyte molds, or Candida spp. It may not be satisfactory to treat onychomycosis on the basis of clinical diagnosis alone. Laboratory diagnosis is an important component of the proper management of this fungal infection. Laboratory diagnostic methods for detecting onychomycosis include light microscopy and culture, or histopathology. Management of onychomycosis includes palliation achieved through mechanical debridement of the nail and topical or oral antifungal therapy.

Candida albicans is a polymorphic yeast, capable of producing budding cells and also filaments, which may be true hyphae or pseudohyphae (elongated yeasts). Candida species can be isolated from healthy skin, therefore correlation with microscopy and clinical findings is vital if the organism is grown on culture. The detection of typical budding yeasts with filaments in a KOH preparation of skin confirms infection (Fig. 4a). In non‐ C. albicans infections, it is common to see yeast cells without hyphae.

### The case of the mysterious pink towels [^115pDgRz]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 50-year-old man presented to the outpatient infectious disease clinic with a 1-year history of pink discoloration of his towels 1 to 2 days after use (Fig 1). His past medical history was significant for morbid obesity, hypertension, and acid reflux. Apart from the discoloration of his towels and occasionally clothing, he had no other symptoms. Suspecting this might be stemming from environmental triggers, he had changed his personal hygiene and cleaning products over the course of the year, and replaced his shower head without resolution of symptoms. The only improvement he noted was after taking Bactrim for a prior urinary tract infection. His main concern was the strain this issue was causing on his personal relationship, as his wife no longer shared the same bathroom, would not allow him entry into her bathroom, and declined intimacy. He had been to multiple family practice physicians and emergency departments who were unable to provide answers. His visit to our clinic was the first time he was evaluated by an infectious disease physician. A thorough skin evaluation including testing patches of the skin with alcohol-based wipes showed no evidence of rashes, lesions, or discoloration. Wood lamp evaluation failed to demonstrate the presence of fungal infection or apocrine chromhidrosis. Bilateral skin cultures were obtained from the inguinal region, and the patient was provided referral to dermatology for skin biopsy. Skin culture results returned positive for heavy colonization of Serratia marcescens, and a diagnosis of pseudochromhidrosis was made. The patient was prescribed trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim DS) twice daily for a 4 to 6 week course and instructed to wash with chlorhexidine liquid soap 3 times weekly. Although his symptoms improved with therapy, he continued to notice intermittent mild pink discoloration of his towel. Unfortunately, the patient discontinued cleansing with the chlorhexidine soap and was later lost to follow-up before further therapeutic treatments could be pursued.

### A case report of tinea capitis in infant in first year of life [^112rEJRZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tinea capitis (TC) is a fungal infection of the scalp and the surrounding skin due to dermatophytes such as Microsporum spp. and Trichophyton spp. It is a predominantly dermatophyte infection in children 3 to 7 years old and it is rare in infants in the first year of life. We report a case of an infant with TC admitted to the Medical Science Department, University of Turin (Italy).

Case presentation

A.M. a 12-month-old male infant, Caucasian, Italian, in good general health, with no history of recent fever or any other symptoms. The patient was evaluated for erythematous scalp lesions and annular patches combined with hair loss (Fig. 1). The infant had not been in contact with animals; her mother and other family members were asymptomatic. No other systemic symptoms were elicited. He was suspected to have a dermatophytosis.

Fig. 1
A 12 month-old male infant presented a history of erythematous scalp lesions combined with hair loss

The Wood's light examination revealed a brilliant green fluorescence on the scalp lesions. Mycological analysis of all suspected dermatophyte lesions was performed. Hair and scale samples were collected and examined under a light microscope with 20% v /v KOH + 40% v/v DMSO solution in distilled water. A fungal culture was performed into Mycobiotic agar (Merck, KGAA, Germany) to identify dermatophytes. Plates were incubated at 25 °C and examined every 2–3 days for at last 15 days. Mold identification was based on macroscopic and microscopic assessment of colonies. Macroscopic examination revealed some white fluffy spreading colonies (Fig. 2), and a characteristic deep yellow-orange pigment on the reverse. Spindle shaped multicellular macroconidia with thick cell walls were detected on microscopic examination (Fig. 3). Clinical features and culture results reveled TC caused by Microsporum canis.

### Progressive macular hypomelanosis arising in a young African American woman in association with pregnancy and a toxic nodular goiter [^111Qsw3m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The authors present the case of a 23-year-old woman of French-Caribbean descent who presented with progression of hypopigmented, scaly ovoid macules on her neck, chest, abdomen and back. She was two months pregnant at the time of the onset of the pigmentary change was also simultaneously diagnosed with a toxic nodular goiter of her thyroid gland. Initial fungal culture, KOH and biopsy were positive for fungal hyphae, and she was treated with four weeks of oral ketaconazole and topical selenium sulfide shampoo. As she had continued progression of her hypopigmented lesions after treatment for pityriasis versicolor, a thorough physical examination (under room light and Wood's lamp) and repeat biopsy were performed. On examination, she demonstrated persistence of the ovoid hypopigmented macules on her neck, chest and abdomen with interval improvement of the superficial scaling. Under Wood's lamp examination, hypopigmented lesions demonstrated a characteristic follicular pink fluorescence associated with porphyrin production by Propionobacterium acnes (P. acnes) described previously in the lesions of progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH). PMH was confirmed histologically by the findings in the second biopsy of a decrease in epidermal melanin pigment and the persistence of pityriasis versicolor was ruled out by an absence of fungal hyphae. Based upon the literature suggesting improvement of PMH with antibiotic therapy to decrease P. acnes colonization, she was treated with 10% benzoyl peroxide wash, clindamycin 1% solution and oral, twice-daily tetracycline 500 mg. During six months of this treatment, she experienced re-pigmentation of many of her existing skin lesions and cessation of the development of new hypopigmented macules.

### Invasive fungal infections after natural disasters [^113v7Tc6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Disasters are complex events that can result in a wide range of health effects, although infectious disease outbreaks as an immediate consequence of disasters are uncommon. Health care providers should be aware of the possibility for cases or clusters of community-acquired or health care–associated fungal infections among disaster survivors because these infections often appear clinically similar to bacterial infections and can be associated with serious illness and death. These infections can occur in persons who do not have the typical immunocompromising risk factors for fungal infection but who have experienced near-drowning, trauma, or other unusual exposure to the environment, such as a dust storm. A fungal infection should be considered early if a patient has a persistent or progressive infection that is not responding to initial antibacterial treatment, particularly because rapid diagnosis and administration of appropriate antifungal therapy can improve patient outcomes. Prompt restoration of disaster-affected aspects of the local health care infrastructure may help facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment and possibly reduce the risk for infection associated with the use of contaminated medical equipment or substandard care. Strategies to reduce disaster-associated fungal infections should be considered within the broader context of comprehensive and sustainable risk reduction methods to prevent disaster-related injury and illness.

Fig 3
Hyperkeratosis with mild papillomatosis and acanthosis. (Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification: ×10.)

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis
B. Erythrasma
C. Tinea corporis and cruris
D. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
E. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)

Answers:
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis – Incorrect. This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by episodic/seasonal circinate, erythematous plaques with scaling, and centrifugal peeling. It predominantly involves palms and soles and may extend up the extremities. It rarely involves the trunk and face. Blisters occasionally occur in the center of new plaques.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. Erythrasma is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum overgrowth in the stratum corneum. Well-defined scaly plaques involve intertriginous sites of the trunk and toes. Coral red fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is classic and was negative in this patient's case.
C. Tinea corporis and cruris – Incorrect. Tinea corporis and cruris are dermatophyte infections of the trunk, extremities, and groin, respectively. Classic lesions have advancing, scaly border and central clearing. Hyphae are seen on histopathology and potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep).
D. EKV – Correct. EKV, an autosomal dominant disorder, presents with transient erythematous patches and stable hyperkeratosis. Individual erythematous lesions persist for minutes to hours, although they may last for days. Simultaneously or over time hyperkeratosis evolves. Sharply demarcated, yellow-brown to pink-brown plaques with figurate borders progressively develop on the limbs, buttocks, and trunk in nearly symmetrical distribution. Histopathology shows orthokeratosis, basket-weave hyperkeratosis, moderate-to-severe acanthosis with prominent granular layer, papillomatosis, and dilated elongated capillaries with minimal perivascular inflammation in the papillary dermis.
E. PSEK – Incorrect. PSEK begins during infancy or early childhood with fixed, sharply demarcated polycyclic hyperkeratotic plaques on erythematous base with fine scale or a rough, verrucous surface. They are symmetrically distributed on extremities, buttocks, face, and occasionally the trunk. Transient erythema and relative sparing of the face differentiate EKV from PSEK.

### Molecular diagnostics in medical mycology [^113RReLv]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

While the most common forms of PCR employ thermocycling, which cycles through a broad range of temperatures (from 5 to 95 °C), a simplified form of PCR, termed isothermal PCR, does not require thermocycling and therefore does not rely on complex instrumentation nor thermostable polymerases. Isothermal reactions utilize a single temperature throughout the amplification process. Strategies that use this approach are particularly attractive to developing countries because instrument cost, complexity, and portability are greatly alleviated by using an incubator instead of thermocycler. Other PCR components are relatively inexpensive, which together, allow PCR to be used in regions of low income and poor infrastructure.

Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), an isothermal PCR technique, is carried out at 60–65 °C and utilizes a polymerase that displaces one of the DNA strands as a new strand is synthesized. LAMP also uses four primers instead of the usual two, which provides a greater specificity than the typical pair of primers, although primer design is more challenging. LAMP has been applied to many of the major fungal pathogens –. A second type of isothermal amplification method used for fungal identification is called Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA), which uses RNA as the template. This reaction typically is done at 41 °C and is extremely sensitive because the RNA target can be present in thousands of copies. In a recent study of invasive aspergillosis for example, Zhao et al. found NASBA to correlate well with an FDA-approved serum 1,3-β-D-glucan kit. A third type of isothermal amplification method used for fungal identification is Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). RCA uses a viral polymerase to amplify the target sequence in the form of a circular template. The major advantages of this method are that it can amplify targets to an excess of 10⁹ copies, requires little optimization, and is resistant to contamination, which is a major concern for other PCR reactions. RCA has been successfully used with the Mucorales, Cryptococcus, and Exophiala speciesto name a few.

### A mysterious white rash [^114Q1THa]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pityriasis alba
B. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor
C. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation
D. Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH)
E. Vitiligo

Answers:
A. Pityriasis alba — Incorrect. Pityriasis alba is a skin condition of hypopigmentation that is associated with atopic dermatitis. It predominantly affects children, and lesions typically involve the face. Wood's lamp examination does not accentuate the hypopigmentation or exhibit perifollicular fluorescence.
B. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor — Incorrect. Like PMH, tinea versicolor is characterized by macular areas of hypopigmentation that typically involve the chest and upper portion of the back. However, tinea versicolor would be expected to improve with antifungal medications and does not exhibit red-orange perifollicular fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination. Instead, black-light illumination of skin affected by tinea versicolor reveals a yellow-orange fluorescence of the yeast. Additionally, potassium hydroxide examination characteristically reveals hyphae and yeast in a "spaghetti and meatballs" pattern.
C. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation — Incorrect. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation describes the loss of pigment in the skin after the resolution of an inflammatory process. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to the loss of functional melanocytes but is not completely understood. Wood's lamp examination does not accentuate hypopigmentation or reveal perifollicular fluorescence.
D. PMH — Correct. PMH is a skin condition of hypopigmentation that was undescribed in the scientific literature until 1988. It is clinically characterized by macular areas of hypopigmentation, typically on the chest or back, which exhibit perifollicular red-orange fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination. This characteristic finding with such an examination was first described by Wu et al in 2010. In their study of 21 patients with a previous diagnosis of PMH and with a previous negative potassium hydroxide test result, all 21 had perifollicular fluorescence with the application of black light. This finding has not been shown to be associated with any other hypomelanotic conditions and may therefore be considered pathognomonic for PMH. Currently, there are reports of cases studied with dermatoscopy; however, in hospitals in which there is no such tool or experience is limited, the use of Wood's lamp is an excellent method of differentiating PMH from other conditions of hypopigmentation, thus avoiding misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments. This report supports the utility of Wood's lamp as a diagnostic tool for hypopigmented lesions.
E. Vitiligo — Incorrect. Vitiligo is an acquired disorder characterized by macules and patches of depigmentation that result from a progressive loss of functional melanocytes. Although clinical presentation may be similar to that of PMH, Wood's lamp examination of areas affected by vitiligo does not reveal red-orange perifollicular fluorescence and demonstrates complete depigmentation rather than the hypopigmentation of PMH.

### Comma hairs: a dermatoscopic marker for tinea capitis: a rapid diagnostic method [^112YG7Xg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Dermatoscopy and videodermatoscopy have been used for several years in the diagnosis of skin disorders.

Objective

We sought to determine whether tinea capitis (TC) shows characteristic videodermatoscopy features that may facilitate its differentiation from alopecia areata (AA).

Methods

Two patients with TC caused by Microsporum canis, confirmed by mycological culture and fluorescence under Wood lamp, were examined with videodermatoscopy and results were compared with videodermatoscopy results of 12 patients with AA.

Results

The distinctive and most prominent feature of TC was presence of commalike structures (comma hairs). These were accompanied by broken and dystrophic hairs. Videodermatoscopy features of AA included exclamation mark hairs, vellus and dystrophic/cadaverized hairs, and yellow dots corresponding to hyperkeratotic hair follicle plugs.

Limitations

This study was conducted on two patients, both with M canis infection.

Conclusions

Comma hairs were observed as a distinctive videodermatoscopy feature of M canis-induced TC. This finding was not observed in AA, typified generally by exclamation mark hairs.

### Novel orthopoxvirus and lethal disease in cat, Italy [^112Z9WrA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Case Study

A domestic, short-haired, male, 6-month-old cat was brought to a veterinarian because of multicentric, nodular, ulcerative dermatitis (Figure 1). The cat was regularly vaccinated for common feline diseases (feline panleukopenia, rhinhotracheitis, calicivirosis, and chlamydiosis) and showed negative test results for retroviral infections. An antiparasitic product had been applied monthly (Frontline Combo Spot On; Merial, Ingelheim, Germany). The cat was fed a balanced commercial diet and lived indoors, but it had access to outdoors and had a hunting behavior.

Figure 1
Cat with orthopoxvirus infection, Italy. Ulcerated nodules and plaques were observed on the lips (A), thorax (B), and forelimb (C). Skin punch biopsy specimen (D) showing leukocyte infiltration and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (arrows) (hematoxylin and eosin stain, original magnification × 60).

The cat had multiple nodular, plaque-like, ulcerative lesions on its body, particularly on the feet and face. Results of diagnostic testing, including a wood lamp examination, skin scrapings, trichogram, and fungal culture, were negative. Cytological examination showed a mixed inflammatory population of cells with a relevant amount of eosinophils. A blood test showed only a mild leukocytosis with an increase in numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Because of rapid worsening of its clinical conditions, the cat was euthanized.

Histopathologic Analysis

We collected multiple skin biopsy specimens for histopathologic analysis by using an 8-mm biopsy punch and fixed these specimens in 10% buffered formalin. Samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, according to standard protocols.

### Widespread hyperpigmented rash present for 1 year [^11192KZ9]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What does Wood's lamp detect in this patient?
A. Coproporphyrin III
B. Melanin
C. Rhodopsin
D. Carotenoid
E. Pyocyanin

Answers:
A. Coproporphyrin III – Correct. Diagnosis of erythrasma can be made easily by Wood's lamp examination, which characteristically fluoresces coral red due to coproporphyrin III.
B. Melanin – Incorrect. Wood's lamp does not detect melanin, the naturally occurring pigment in skin and hair.
C. Rhodopsin – Incorrect. Wood's lamp does not detect rhodopsin, which is the purple pigment in eyes that helps with sight in dim light.
D. Carotenoid – Incorrect. Wood's lamp does not detect these red, yellow, or orange pigments, such as carotene, which give color to plant parts such as carrots or fall leaves.
E. Pyocyanin – Incorrect. Wood's lamp does not detect this blue-green pigment, which gives pseudomonas its characteristic color.

Question 3: How would you treat this patient?
A. Topical steroids
B. Macrolide antibiotic
C. Immunotherapy
D. Topical antifungals
E. Barrier cream

Answers:
A. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Topical steroids would be used for a diagnosis of inverse psoriasis and are not indicated for erythrasma, as it is a bacterial infection.
B. Macrolide antibiotic – Correct. Erythrasma is treated with topical clindamycin, erythromycin, or antibacterial soaps, such as benzoyl peroxide. For recalcitrant or extensive disease, a 5- to 14-day course of oral erythromycin or clarithromycin is used to eliminate the corynebacterium. For therapeutic failure of intertriginous involvement, topical clindamycin or other antibacterial soaps are added.
C. Immunotherapy – Incorrect. Immunotherapy can be used for cutaneous malignancies, such as mycosis fungoides; however, immunotherapy is not used for the treatment of erythrasma.
D. Topical antifungals – Incorrect. The patient has not responded to topical and oral antifungals, and these are not indicated in the treatment of erythrasma.
E. Barrier cream – Incorrect. Barrier creams are typically used to treat dermatitis and dry skin and work to improve barrier function of the skin and reduce its susceptibility to irritants.

### Zygomycosis: conventional laboratory diagnosis [^116YETKd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

A definitive diagnosis of zygomycosis caused by Mucorales can be made by histopathological examination with or without isolation of the fungus from the same site. Histopathological examination of the tissues affected typically shows characteristic broad, hyaline, ribbon-like, irregular fungal hyphae with wide-angle branching, accompanied by tissue necrosis and angioinvasion of the fungi. Tissue invasion by the fungal hyphae as seen by microscopy is essential to establish the diagnosis. Fungal elements can be stained with Gomori methenamine-silver, periodic acid-Schiff or Calcoflour white stain. All Mucorales grow rapidly on most fungal media such as Sabouraud dextrose agar incubated at 25–30 degrees C. Mucorales from a sterile site or repeated positive cultures of the fungi from a non-sterile site are considered significant in a high-risk patient with predisposing factors for acquisition of zygomycosis. Positive cultures from non-sterile specimens should be interpreted with caution and will require correlation between the finding and the clinical situation.

### Disseminated botryomycosis: a rare presentation [^116pmW53]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Botryomycosis is a rare chronic bacterial infection of the skin or viscera that resembles a deep fungal infection. Botryomycosis has two distinct patterns of infection, visceral and cutaneous, the latter being the most common. Cutaneous botryomycosis typically appears as a solitary plaque with superficial pustules. Histologically, bacterial colonies are arranged in a distinctive "bunch of grapes" pattern with surrounding eosinophilia, known as the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. Here we report a case of an 83-year-old female with disseminated botryomycosis.

### Diagnostic procedures in dermatology [^1167CVQU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Although most skin diseases can be diagnosed with simple visual inspection, laboratory investigations are necessary in several clinical circumstances. This contribution highlights the usefulness of routine diagnostic procedures that are often overlooked and the innovative methods of molecular biology, which are expensive and require an experienced staff. Among the classic diagnostic investigations are (1) the use of Wood's light in many dermatologic disorders (eg, vitiligo, pityriasis versicolor, erythrasma, porphyrias), (2) cytodiagnosis of Tzanck in dermatologic practice (eg, herpetic infections, molluscum contagiosum, leishmaniasis, pemphigus vulgaris, basal cell carcinoma, erythroplasia of Queyrat, Hailey-Hailey disease), and (3) microscopic examination for fungal and bacterial skin infections as well as for mite infestation using potassium hydroxide, simple saline, and Gram stain. Modern molecular biotechnologies encompassing gene-specific polymerase chain reaction and its variants have a substantial affect in selected cases of viral (especially herpes simplex virus), bacterial, fungal, and protozoan (Leishmania) skin infections.

### Fungal keratitis: diagnosis, management, and recent advances [^116w79Fd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fungal Keratitis Definitive Diagnosis is Achieved If

Fungal elements are seen in corneal smears.
Single medium showing fungal growth in the presence of fungus in smears.
Growth of fungus in two or more media in the absence of fungus-positive smears.
Fungal growth in a single solid medium at the site of inoculation in confluent form.

Fungal growth in positive cultures occurs in more than 80% after 3 days and in more than 95% after 7 days. Microbiologists should wait for at least 7–14 days before reporting culture-negative fungi. Brain heart infusion may be useful as a transport medium but is not routinely used. Both yeast and filamentous fungi can grow readily on blood agar and SDA at room temperature. The use of plastic bags to place the agar inside is usually useful to increase humidity and enhance fungal growth. Fungal growth can be seen by the naked eye or using a dissecting microscope.

Keratectomy and Biopsy

Corneal biopsy with diagnostic Keratectomy is more diagnostic than corneal scraping for fungal keratitis. It may be considered if corneal smears and cultures are negative. Partial-thickness trephination is performed using a 2–3 mm sterile disposable trephine to excise part of a clear cornea along with the infected cornea. Thereafter, to complete a partial-thickness keratectomy, the base is dissected and separated using a surgical blade. It is essential to avoid the visual axis. The procedure is usually performed under topical anaesthesia under an operating microscope or a slit lamp. The removed tissue is used for microbiological and histopathological examination. An excised corneal button during therapeutic keratoplasty may also be used for corneal biopsy. On histopathological examination, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) are the most commonly used stains to detect fungal hyphae and inflammatory signs.

### An underestimated pathogen: species [^114nqo4T]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Erythrasma

Corynebacterium minutissimum has been classically associated with a chronic superficial erythematous rash called erythrasma, which involves warm, moist intertriginous body spaces. C. minutissimum can be misidentified for the closely related C. aurimucosum, this is especially true when using conventional phenotypic methods. This does cast some concerns about the reliability of the identification of C. minutissimum in historic cases where the bacteria were isolated in culture from clinical cases. The use of the C. amycolatum / minutissimum group when discussing these previous cases is likely the most accurate identification. C. minutissimum does produce coproporphyrin III, which fluoresces with a coral-pink coloration under UV light. Wood's lamp illumination of skin lesions containing the bacteria or colonies grown on agar plates will reveal coral-pink fluorescence. The diagnosis of erythrasma is generally obtained by clinical presentation and physical examination findings, with culture-confirmed cases by C. minutissimum being sparse at best. When a microbiological culture of erythrasma skin lesions has been performed, other potential pathogens such as yeast and dermatophytes have been recovered. This sheds doubt on this cutaneous disease as a purely monomicrobial process. Treatment for erythrasma generally involves topical antimicrobial therapy; however, in severe cases, systemic antibiotics may be considered.

### Common tinea infections in children [^11658ib2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The common dermatophyte genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are major causes of superficial fungal infections in children. These infections (e.g., tinea corporis, pedis, cruris, and unguium) are typically acquired directly from contact with infected humans or animals or indirectly from exposure to contaminated soil or fomites. A diagnosis usually can be made with a focused history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide microscopy. Occasionally, Wood's lamp examination, fungal culture, or histologic tissue examination is required. Most tinea infections can be managed with topical therapies; oral treatment is reserved for tinea capitis, severe tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Topical therapy with fungicidal allylamines may have slightly higher cure rates and shorter treatment courses than with fungistatic azoles. Although oral griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis, newer oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole are effective, safe, and have shorter treatment courses.

### Photo quiz: skin scraping of persistent lesion reveals the main course [^111hVTwr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Malassezia species are a commensal constituent of human skin flora. Through an unknown mechanism, Malassezia species that are pathogenic produce hyphal forms. Identification to the species level is not usually required for superficial mycosis as the treatment is identical for all Malassezia species — a topical triazole or terbinafine cream, though oral antifungals are an option in severe or recurrent infection. In the case of fungemia, species identification is required as systemic treatment will be warranted, and susceptibility profiles are not necessarily predictable between species.

Clinically, as seen in this patient, Malassezia species form superficial, large, coalescing, scaly, painless patches on the trunk and proximal limbs but can be found anywhere on the body. Macules or patches may be hypo- or hyperpigmented. A Wood's lamp examination can reveal a yellow-green to copper-orange fluorescence, though Malassezia does not always fluoresce. Malassezia species are capable of more severe infections, such as folliculitis or seborrheic dermatitis. Interestingly, studies have shown that multiple Malassezia species can be isolated from a single patient. An important consideration is that as Malassezia species are skin flora constituents, their lipophilic nature places patients receiving parenteral nutrient (lipid) supplementation at a higher risk of Malassezia fungemia from colonized catheters.

### Multidetector computed tomography and MR imaging findings in mycotic infections [^113SUhyQ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Fungal infections constitute a diverse spectrum of infections with variable clinical and imaging features. They are commonly opportunistic infections that affect immunocompromised individuals secondary to inherited or acquired disorders. Fungal infections may affect multiple organ systems and contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Although the imaging features of some fungal infections are characteristic and permit their diagnosis, many mycotic infections manifest nonspecific findings. Definitive diagnosis often depends on histopathological analysis. Early diagnosis requires both clinical suspicion and supporting radiological evidence. Early treatment results in reduced morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the imaging findings in opportunistic and endemic fungal infections.

### Perialar intertrigo in children and adolescents: a multicenter prospective study of 41 cases [^116wxbXZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

We observed isolated cases of perialar intertrigo in children and teenagers that did not appear to correspond to any known clinical entity. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features of this dermatosis and the clinical characteristics of the patients.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in France from August 2017 to November 2019. All the patients under 18years of age with chronic perinasal intertrigo were included. A standardized questionnaire detailing the clinical characteristics of the patients and the description of the intertrigo. If possible, a Wood's lamp examination of the intertrigo was done.

Results

Forty-one patients were included (25 boys and 16 girls, average age: 12.1years). Intertrigo was bilateral in 38 patients (93%). The majority of patients had no symptoms (54%). Pruritus was present in 39% of cases. Orange red follicular fluorescence was present in the perialar region on Wood's light examination in 78% of cases with active fluorescence. The presumptive diagnoses suggested by the investigators were acne (24.4%), seborrheic dermatitis (19.5%), rosacea (9.8%), psoriasis (9.8%) and perioral dermatitis (7.3%). No diagnosis was proposed in 22% of the cases.

Conclusions

We describe a previously undescribed clinical sign which is characterized by a chronic bilateral erythematous intertrigo located in the perialar region. It can be isolated or associated with various facial dermatoses.

### Mucormycosis: an atrocious mate of patients with diabetes [^1115ShYG]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Mucormycosis also called zygomycosis is a rare infection caused by saprophytic aerobic fungus that belongs to a group of fungi called Mucoromycotina in the order Mucorales. Earlier these fungi were called Zygomycota but this scientific name has recently been changed. Mucormycosis can result in an acute, rapidly advancing and occasionally fatal disease caused by different fungi typically found in the soil and in association with decaying organic matter such as leaves, compost piles or rotten wood. These fungal infections are relatively infrequent; however, they occur in individuals who are debilitated in some major way and occasionally in groups of people with multiple penetrating injuries that are contaminated with soil and water from the environment. Mucormycosis is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.

### Are indoor molds causing a new disease? [^115Nu4am]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms for disease caused by mold-infection, allergy, and toxicity-are established and well recognized by clinicians. In each case the corresponding diseases are specific to a particular fungus. The mechanisms involved include a recognized inflammatory pathology that leads to objective clinical evidence of disease. Recent widespread litigation has arisen out of an unproved assertion that exposure to indoor molds causes an ill-defined illness. This illness is characterized by the absence of objective evidence of disease and by the lack of a defined pathology. There is usually no specificity for the involved fungus purported to cause the illness. Those publications that claim such an illness are reviewed. They are found to lack scientific validity, often on the basis of faulty methodology and insufficient information. There is no coherent clinical description for the presumed illness. Recommendations are offered for published reports and studies to address this problem.

### Wood decay under anoxia by the brown-rot fungus fomitopsis pinicola [^114vw4oJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Forests are a large and persistent carbon sink that stores 45% of the total carbon (C) of terrestrial ecosystems. An equilibrated forest microbiome is required to enable a continuous C cycle and ensure the forest's resilience towards global changes. While plants are responsible for the large ecosystem uptake of C through photosynthesis, fungal saprotrophs are the main decomposers of lignocellulose.

The most efficient fungal wood decayers have been empirically classified into soft-, white-, and brown-rots based on the appearance of the degraded wood following colonisation. Their decaying strategies rely on complex mechanisms combining abiotic chemistry with enzymatic activities. Differences in the mode of wood decay between brown-rots and white-rots have been supported in recent years by comparing the number of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in fungal genomes and machine-learning techniques. White-rot fungi secrete a complete arsenal of PCWDEs, including oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes, to degrade the different plant cell wall polymers. However, brown-rot fungi, which are predominant decayers of softwood in boreal forests, degrade holocellulose in a staggered mechanism, initiated by the controlled biochemical and enzymatic formation of highly reactive and short-lived hydroxyl radicals through Fenton chemistry, which is believed to be the primary cause of the decay. For the second stage, brown-rot fungi employ PCWDEs, yet these are a smaller set enzymes compared to white-rot fungi. Lignin and crystalline cellulose remain because they lack of key hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes (e.g. cellobiohydrolases, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, multicopper oxidases, and peroxidases). Despite these recent advances in the genomics and biochemistry of fungal saprotrophs, improved understanding of wood decay is needed.

### Erythrasma: a systematic review of interventions [^112r2QeJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrasma is a chronic superficial bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum, commonly affecting intertriginous areas. Cutaneous features include erythema, scaling, and skin discoloration, with the characteristic coral-red fluorescence under a Wood's lamp. Despite a variety of treatment options available, a comprehensive consensus on the most effective treatment approach is lacking.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of topical and systemic therapies for erythrasma.

Evidence Review

PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for interventions on Erythrasma from 1971 to 2020. The reference list was searched for additional articles. Humanised randomised controlled trials and clinical studies on interventions were included. Complete clearance of lesions was the primary outcome. At least two reviewers were involved in article screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment.

Results

We have included 12 articles from the screened 54 articles, of which 6 were randomised controlled trials and 6 were comparative clinical studies. The number of patients varied from 8 to 151. Most of the studies have used Wood's lamp reflection score as outcome measures, whereas few studies have used mycological cure as outcome measures. The outcome measures were heterogeneous across studies. However, treatment modalities were well tolerated.

Conclusion

The study found both clotrimazole and fusidic acid effective, with fusidic acid showing faster symptom resolution, reduced Wood's lamp reflection, and fewer side effects. Clarithromycin was more effective than erythromycin, though gastrointestinal side effects were common. Topical treatments were generally safer. There is a paucity of large randomised controlled trials with standardised outcome measure.

### Phaeoisaria sp. fungal keratitis resembling corneal rust residue: a case report [^117S8WBR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The corneal lesion in our patient resulted from an iron foreign body injury, appearing brownish in color, which differed from the typical presentation of fungal keratitis, making it susceptible to misdiagnosis as rust residue. Post-traumatic keratitis has been reported in 55–65% of keratomycosis cases according to previous research. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential for fungal infection and remain vigilant.

Phaeoisaria sp. primarily causes plant infections, wheras human infections caused by this fungus are uncommon. Phaeoisaria clematidis mainly infects plants such as Clematis, and only one previous research has reported it as a cause of human keratitis. However, its clinical characteristics and the corneal ulcers have not been fully described. Phaeoisaria sp. is a dark, filamentous fungus with low invasive potential and a high likelihood of lateral growth on the cornea. While previous studies have focused on the etiology, this study pays more attention to the unusual appearance of corneal ulcers and their imaging features.

According to previous studies, this species of fungus is known for its high level of resistance, and is likely to be resistant to commonly used antifungal drugs in clinical practice. Given the severity of the patient's condition, we administered 0.1% amphotericin B eye drops in combination with surgical intervention and the topical application of iodine tinctures. Removing red material from the surface of corneal ulcers provides specimens for pathogen detection and aids in the identification of ferrous foreign bodies. This may enhance the efficacy of topical drug therapy.

In our literature search, previous animal studies indicated that Phaeoisaria clematidis can infect mice, leading to dark nodular lesions across multiple organs. Histological examination revealed that the lesions were characterized by granulomata. However, there is currently no direct evidence of human infection in other organs. Further research is necessary to explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms and clinical relevance of this fungus.

### Utility of the wood's light: five cases from a pigmented lesion clinic [^116xXwg2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We demonstrate the utility of the Wood's light in a practice that specializes in the evaluation of pigmented lesions. The Wood's light assisted the physician in locating the site of a completely regressed primary cutaneous melanoma, determining the clinical borders of a lentigo maligna melanoma, differentiating between agminated naevi and a naevus spilus and detecting the recurrence of pigmentation after the excision of a dysplastic naevus, and also proved useful in monitoring a large segmental speckled atypical lentiginous naevus for change. Despite the availability of many 'high-tech' imaging and diagnostic devices designed to evaluate skin lesions, the relatively simple Wood's lamp continues to be of great value. We encourage physicians not to abandon the use of the Wood's light in their clinical practice.

### Invasive eye infection caused by trichoderma harzianum [^114wNdhn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Endophthalmitis is a potentially devastating intraocular infection. Exogenous endophthalmitis is more common than endogenous endophthalmitis, and it is secondary to recent ocular trauma or ophthalmic interventions, such as surgery or injections. To the best of our knowledge, endophthalmitis caused by T. harzianum in a healthy patient has not been reported in the literature. T. harzianum is an uncommon opportunistic pathogen belonging to the genus Trichoderma, and it is usually found in humid soil and decaying wood. Infections can lead to mortality rates of up to 53% in immunocompromised patients.

For patients with T. harzianum infections, doctors need to combine the patient's history and physical examination to initiate appropriate treatment immediately, whereas cultures of tissue samples are needed for a definitive diagnosis of a Trichoderma infection. Fungal culture and mNGS are effective in the diagnosis of infections caused by rare pathogens.

There are few reported cases of T. harzianum infections in healthy humans, and here, we report the case of ocular fungal infection caused by T. harzianum in a healthy patient. We are guessing that the infection was because of accidental trauma from a puncture vine that was hypothetically carrying the fungus, and Wang and Tu also reported that the Trichoderma longibrachiatum culture of the planting soil was positive (the patient had a history of close contact with a pot of Epipremnum aureum for more than 1 month before the onset of the disease). Bhullar et al. reported that among the exogenous causes, penetrating eye injury (56.3%) was the most common etiological factor. The effective treatment of fungal endophthalmitis rests on the combination of intravitreal antibiotics and systemic antifungal therapy.

In conclusion, the report indicates that fungal infections caused by the Trichoderma species can also occur in individuals with normal immunity. Therefore, it is recommended that doctors pay attention to the presence of fungal infections after injuries by plants during the diagnosis and treatment process.

### Late permian wood-borings reveal an intricate network of ecological relationships [^115qUf1r]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Wood-boring beetles evolved in association with microscopic fungi as food sources. These fungi degraded woody debris lodged in tunnels or were microbiotal elements in beetle's digestive tracts, thereby providing the important service of cellulose degradation. Larval consumption of wood and the presence of cellulytic fungi strongly indicate obligate nutritional dependency on fungi and thus an early form of agriculture. The association of fungal hyphae within borings indicates that beetle occupants likely were primitive agriculturists, analogous to modern bark beetles, macrotermitine termites and attine ants,– that first appear during the Early Cretaceous. Diverse plant‒fungus interactions are commonly known since the Devonian. The oldest fungally infected wood has been reported in a Late Devonian progymnosperm, but lacks a wood-borer nutritional component. However, there is evidence for the third, arthropod component in a glossopterid–fungus–arthropod interaction nexus during the middleand upperPermian of Antarctica. The arthropod members of these tritrophic nutritional relationships probably were insects. The first persuasive evidence for a conifer–fungus–beetle wood-borer relationship was documented from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina(Supplementary Note 1). The late Permian nutritional relationships described here occurred within a broader food web of a conifer source plant, fungal saprobes, insect and mite herbivores and fungivores, and chelicerate predators. We note that while fungi was present in the tunnels (Fig. 1s), neither spores nor hyphae were detected in the virtually opaque coprolites (Fig. 2), an observation also seen in the faecal pellets of extant oribatid mites and bark beetles that result from fluidisation of all but the most refractory ingested food prior to defecation.

### Ringworm information for healthcare professionals… [^114XDoqM]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Ringworm Information for Healthcare Professionals Definition and sources of infection Ringworm, also called "tinea" or "dermatophytosis, " is a common infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophyte molds. People can acquire ringworm through direct skin contact with people and animals who are infected. People can also acquire ringworm by sharing personal items or through contact with surfaces found in moist areas. Ringworm can also spread from one part of the body to another. Learn more about how steroid creams can make ringworm worse. Learn more about emerging antimicrobial-resistant ringworm infections. Diagnostic testing Potassium hydroxide preparation Clinicians can use a potassium hydroxide preparation of skin scrapings or nail clippings to confirm a diagnosis of ringworm.

This test can provide rapid results, but the test's accuracy depends on clinician experience and technique. 2 Fungal culture Fungal culture can be used to diagnose ringworm. Fungal culture is more specific than KOH stain, but results may take several weeks. 3, 4. Ultraviolet light Ultraviolet light can be useful for diagnosing ringworm caused by Microsporum canis and Microsporum audouinii. Although both species fluoresce blue-green under a Wood's lamp, these species are uncommon causes of ringworm infections in people. Itraconazole and fluconazole have been shown to be safe and effective, but are not FDA-approved for this indication. 6 Selenium sulfide shampoos can be used as adjunctive therapy. 6–7 Clinicians should generally confirm the diagnosis of tinea capitis using a laboratory test.
8. Treatment failure Most ringworm infections improve with antifungal treatment, but treatment failure may occur.

Common reasons for treatment failure may include incorrect diagnosis and inadequate treatment. Clinicians should counsel patients on the importance of taking antifungal medications as prescribed. Emerging resistance is another potential cause of treatment failure. Antifungal resistant. Trichophyton rubrum and Tinea indotineae are emerging global public health concerns.

### Infectious pseudochromhidrosis in the setting of dupilumab use [^1172ypNx]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Because this patient presented with blue sweat, the differential diagnosis included chromhidrosis or pseudochromhidrosis, which are both rare conditions of colored sweat. Many features of this case favored pseudochromhidrosis over chromhidrosis. The generalized distribution of the blue sweat made apocrine chromhidrosis less likely. Additionally, the negative Wood's lamp examination made a diagnosis of apocrine chromhidrosis less favorable. Apocrine chromhidrosis is often because of oxidation of lipofuscin, and an increased number of yellow-brown lipofuscin granules in the apocrine glands is observed on Wood's lamp examination. An eccrine source was also considered, since ingestion of dyes or colored foods can cause eccrine chromhidrosis; however, the patient denied eating many artificially colored foods. Therefore, pseudochromhidrosis emerged as the likely diagnosis. Because of the absence of dye or chemical exposures, an infectious source was suspected. The IPCH diagnosis was confirmed with positive cultures for B cereus.

B cereus is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that causes food poisoning, local infections, and systemic infections. Bacillus species have also previously been associated with blue IPCH. Reports of IPCH caused by Bacillus species have proposed that medications (such as ranitidine, promethazine, and topiramate) that alter the skin pH and microflora may trigger Bacillus colonization and IPCH. Dupilumab was started 3 months before the onset of blue sweat, suggesting a potential association with the IPCH. It is possible that dupilumab may have led to alterations in the patient's skin microflora. The blue sweat persisted after the patient stopped dupilumab injections due to injection-site pain; however, this may not necessarily rule out an association, if the effects on skin microflora were not quickly reversed. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that dupilumab can have effects on skin microflora for up to 18 weeks following the last injection.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes are spread by direct contact from other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites. Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Diagnosis occasionally requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination. Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with the newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate. The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Cutaneous protothecosis [^113zcaaT]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prototheca species are an achlorophyllic algae that cause infections primarily in immunocompromised individuals. At least one-half of infectious cases are cutaneous. Because protothecosis is seldom suspected clinically, patients may be subjected to various treatment modalities for extended periods without satisfactory results. Cutaneous protothecosis shares similar clinical and pathologic findings with deep tissue fungal mycoses. The typical presentation occurs most commonly on the face and extremities as erythematous plaques, nodules, or superficial ulcers. Prototheca spp are spherical, unicellular, nonbudding organisms that are sometimes noted on routine hematoxylin-eosin staining but are best visualized with periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori methenamine-silver histochemical stains. Although protothecosis can be diagnosed on biopsy, culture of the organism on a medium such as Sabouraud dextrose agar is required for definitive diagnosis. Treatment may require a combination of surgical excision and antifungal agents. Therefore, cutaneous protothecosis should be considered in a lesion that appears suspicious for the more-common fungal infections.

### Fungal keratitis: diagnosis, management, and recent advances [^114ccC3u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features

History-taking is an important step in the evaluation of a case of suspected fungal keratitis. It is important to ask about the onset and course of the disease. Mycotic keratitis usually has an insidious onset and a gradual course. Asking the patient about a history of trauma, contact lens use, systemic diseases, and medications is essential.

Symptoms of mycotic keratitis include blurring of vision, irritation, redness, photophobia, watering, and discharge. Pain is usually less than that of bacterial or Acanthamoeba keratitis and does not correlate with clinical signs.

Clinical signs (Figure 1) include hyperemia in the form of circumcorneal ciliary flush, corneal infiltration, edema, loss of lusterness and ulcer borders are usually feathery. Ulcers are usually associated with grey or yellow stromal infiltration that extends beyond the edges of the ulcer. A grey ring of infiltration may be seen in the cornea as fluffy elevated lesions with dirty yellow or brown pigmentation. Dense infiltration at the level of endothelium may be presented by endothelial plaques. Satellites in the form of multifocal micro abscesses are seen in more than 10% of cases. The anterior chamber reaction in the form of a thick hypopyon is seen in more than half of the cases. Variation in clinical appearance is usually related to causative fungal species.

Figure 1
Clinical signs of fungal corneal ulcer: Early fungal ulcer with feathery borders (blue arrow), Stromal infiltration (green arrow) (a). Advanced central fungal ulcer with satellites and dense infiltration (Black arrow) (b). Advanced fungal ulcer with dense infiltration (Green arrow), satellites (Black arrow), and hypopyon (Yellow arrow) (c). Corneal Opacification and vascularization following fungal ulcer (d).

It was found that clinical signs including serrated or feathery ulcer margins, raised borders, presence of satellite lesions, and color of infiltrates can be helpful in clinical differentiation between fungal and bacterial keratitis (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Clinical signs differentiating fungal corneal ulcer (a) from bacterial (b). The signs are infiltration (Green arrow), feathery borders (blue arrow), and hypopyon (Yellow arrow).

In candida and other yeast-induced keratitis, the ulcer configuration shows a "collar button" appearance. The ulcer is usually small with expanding infiltration of the stroma. It resembles bacterial keratitis but has a slow progressive course, a more discrete stromal infiltration, and shows no response to topical antibiotics.

### A mysterious white rash [^1113EFt9]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case

A 40-year-old Vietnamese man presented for an asymptomatic rash on his back and chest that had been present for the past decade. Over the years, he was treated by multiple providers, including 7 dermatologists. The rash had not improved despite treatment with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, various bland emollients, ketoconazole cream and shampoo, oral fluconazole, and various over-the-counter antifungal medications. On examination, the patient had nonscaly, hypopigmented macules coalescing into patches on his chest and back (Fig 1). He denied itching, pain, or other symptoms. Potassium hydroxide test result was negative and biopsy revealed no pathologic changes. Wood's lamp examination revealed perifollicular, punctiform, red-orange fluorescence (Fig 2).

### A single typical trichoscopic feature is predictive of tinea capitis: a prospective multicentre study [^113MrKjr]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Specific trichoscopic signs of tinea capitis (TC) were first described in 2008. The accuracy of this diagnostic tool has not been evaluated.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of trichoscopy.

Methods

A prospective, multicentre study was done between March 2015 and March 2017 at the dermatology departments of four French university medical centres. Patients with a presumed diagnosis of TC were included. Trichoscopy was considered to be positive if at least one specific trichoscopic sign was observed. Trichoscopy results were compared with the gold standard for diagnosis of TC (mycological culture).

Results

One hundred patients were included. Culture was positive for 53 patients and negative for 47. The sensitivity of trichoscopy was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 88–100], specificity was 83% (95% CI 72–94), positive predictive value was 92% and negative predictive value was 86%. Comma hairs, corkscrew hairs, zigzag hairs, Morse-code-like hairs and whitish sheath were significantly more frequent in patients with a positive mycological culture (P < 0.001). Comma hairs were more frequent in patients with Trichophyton TC (P = 0.026), and zigzag hairs were more frequent in patients with Microsporum TC (P < 0.001). Morse-code-like hair was not observed in any patients with Trichophyton TC and therefore appears to be highly specific for Microsporum TC.

Conclusions

The presence of a single trichoscopic finding is predictive of TC. Trichoscopy is a useful, rapid, painless, highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of TC - even for dermoscopists with little experience of trichoscopy. It enhances physicians' ability to make treatment decisions. What's already known about this topic? Tinea capitis (TC) must be confirmed by a mycological culture that may take up to 6 weeks, delaying treatment. Specific trichoscopic signs of TC were first described in 2008, but the accuracy of trichoscopy for diagnosing TC has not previously been evaluated. What does this study add? The present series is the largest yet on the use of trichoscopy in the diagnosis of TC. Our results demonstrated that the presence of a single feature (comma hair, corkscrew hair, zigzag hair, Morse-code-like hair or whitish sheath) is predictive of TC. Trichoscopy is painless and highly sensitive. Morse-code-like hair appears to be highly specific for Microsporum TC.

### The corkscrew and comma-shaped hairs of tinea capitis [^1175755H]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Dermatoscopic appearance

Dermatoscopic examination revealed comma-shaped, coiled, and corkscrew-like hairs emanating from hair follicles (Fig 2).

Key message and histologic diagnosis

The dermatoscopic findings are characteristic of tinea capitis and are thought to be the result of the invasion of the hair by fungi commonly found in the Trichophyton or Microsporum genera. Comma-shaped hairs are found in both Trichophyton and Microsporum infections, whereas corkscrew hairs are more commonly found in infections by Trichophyton and are thought to be the result of its endothrix invasion of the hair shaft. Wood's light examination of the hair would reveal bright-green fluorescence with most Microsporum infections, faint-blue fluorescence with Trichophyton schoenleinii, and no fluorescence with Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton verrucosum. Here, the combination of the clinical examination, lack of Wood's light fluorescence, and presence of corkscrew hairs suggest infection by fungi in the Trichophyton genera — the most common of which being infection by Trichophyton tonsurans.

Our patient was treated empirically with daily terbinafine (250 mg) for 6 weeks with resolution. The fungal culture of the skin and hair ultimately identified Trichophyton tonsurans.

### Wood's lamp employed as a provocative technique to identify pseudoseizures [^1159vKHy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 12-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with ictal phenomena suggestive of pseudoseizures. A Wood's lamp was successfully employed to induce the stereotypic phenomena and thereby identify the ictal events as nonepileptiform. Use of the Wood's lamp has not previously been reported as a provocative stimulus to induce pseudoseizures. Given its noninvasive nature and ready availability, the Wood's lamp should be considered for identification of pseudoseizures.

### Nondermatophytic filamentous fungi infection in south America – reality or misdiagnosis? [^112Q7ZCr]. Dermatologic Clinics (2008). Low credibility.

For the last 10 years, a steady increment in the diagnosis of nondermatophyte filamentous fungal infections has been observed. This trend also applies to the valuation of the medical mycology. It can be attributed, in part, to the increased concern of the population with the aesthetic aspect, the easiest access to health information, and the increased demand for specialized jobs. Moreover, increase in the diagnosis of new emerging fungi is also caused by the improvement of the diagnostic techniques available as well as the qualification and constant update of the professionals in medical mycology. Another relevant aspect is the valorization of medical mycology in the medical curriculum. Misdiagnosis can lead to treatment failures, because not all nail diseases are caused by fungi. Therefore, the importance of clinical diagnosis is strictly associated with laboratory results.

The patient was treated with griseofulvin, 20 to 25 mg per kg per day, and ketoconazole 2% shampoo applied to the scalp for five minutes, rinsed daily for two weeks, and then rinsed twice a week for six weeks. The kerion resolved after eight weeks, leaving patchy alopecia with permanent scarring. Tinea capitis can mimic seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, sebopsoriasis, and discoid lupus. It can develop into a kerion. 1, 2 It is caused by advanced disease and an exaggerated immune response, predominantly found in children five to 10 years of age.

3 More than 20 misdiagnosed cases have been reported, usually as bacterial abscesses or dissecting cellulitis. 4 Delayed treatment increases risk of permanent hair loss. Tinea capitis should be treated with systemic antifungals because topical medications inadequately penetrate the hair follicle. 2 Oral griseofulvin is the first-line treatment. 5 A systematic review found that griseofulvin was more effective for Microsporum species, whereas terbinafine was equally or slightly more effective for Trichophyton dermatophytes. 1, 5 Some clinicians treat kerion with prednisone, although combination treatment may not be superior to antifungals alone. 6 Antibiotics are unnecessary unless a secondary bacterial infection is identified.
6. Topical antifungal shampoos as an adjunctive scalp treatment can decrease infectivity and be used in family members to decrease risk of reinfection from asymptomatic carriers.

Ketoconazole 2% shampoo should be applied to the scalp for five to 10 minutes, two to three times per week for at least two weeks or until the infection has cleared. Fomites should be disinfected or discarded because dermatophytes can stay viable for prolonged periods.

### Cutaneous infections due to opportunistic molds: uncommon presentations [^116Wh82Q]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Molds are quite more often suspected as pathogens by the public than by the medical care community. Molds may, however, cause serious medical problems, and mold infections can develop incognito. Among the mycoses caused by opportunistic molds, alternariosis and fusariosis together with aspergillosis are of particular importance. They are more common than other groups with pathological characteristics. The aim of our presentation is to demonstrate the important role of common molds as causative agents in skin and ear infections. The clinical picture, etiology and pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment, and course and prognosis of cutaneous infections will be given. The spectrum of clinical symptoms ranges from eczemalike lesions to chronic erythematous, verrucous lesions of the skin or multiple acute infiltrations of the dermis, occasionally forming abscesses. The mycologic direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, and a histological examination of a skin biopsy are strongly recommended. The outbreak of cutaneous infections is triggered by weakened host defense mechanisms. A review of the literature regarding immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients will be given.

### Fungal melanonychia [^111QZB4V]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Melanonychia is characterized by tan, brown, or black pigmentation within the nail plate. Fungal melanonychia is rare and may simulate longitudinal melanonychia caused by melanocytic lesions. We report six cases of fungal melanonychia which were confirmed histopathologically or mycologically. On culture, Candida and/or Aspergillus species were isolated in four patients. The nail pigmentation improved after treatment with antifungal agents in all cases, but one patient experienced a new lesion on another nail after cessation of treatment. Fungal infection should be considered as a cause of melanonychia, and fungal melanonychia should be differentiated from the melanonychia caused by melanocytic lesions, particularly by subungual melanoma.

Case 2

A 20-year-old Black woman with HS since 3 years presented with an active disease of her suprapubic area, labia majora, and medial aspect of the left thigh. The patient had a disease of the axillae, buttocks, and breasts treated with aggressive surgery, doxycycline, chlorhexidine wash, topical clindamycin, intralesional triamcinolone, and adalimumab. Physical examination revealed draining sinus tracts in the left thigh, suprapubic area, and labia majora with granulating ulcers of the sacrum and right buttock. Erythematous, scaly plaques were noted on the medial aspect of the left thigh (Fig 2, A). Wood's lamp revealed coral-red fluorescence (Fig 2, B) of the medial aspect of the left thigh, consistent with erythrasma. The erythrasma responded to oral erythromycin base 500 mg that was administered 4 times daily for 7 days, after failing a course of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide combination gel.

### Tender violaceous nodule on the palm [^116VjenR]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sporotrichosis
B. Noninfectious foreign body granuloma
C. Coccidioidomycosis
D. Phaeohyphomycosis
E. Bacillary angiomatosis

Answers:
A. Sporotrichosis – Incorrect. Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus. Cutaneous infection usually results from traumatic inoculation and most commonly presents with a lymphangitic pattern. The presence of pigmented fungi on histology would not be expected.
B. Noninfectious foreign body granuloma – Incorrect. Foreign body granulomas develop from inflammatory reactions to the introduction of exogenous material and may appear as nodules. In this case, the biopsy showed a wood splinter (Fig 2) but also revealed fungal spores and hyphae (Fig 3). The foreign body may serve as a source of infection.
C. Coccidioidomycosis – Incorrect. Coccidioidomycosis is caused by 2 dimorphic fungi, Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii. It occurs predominantly in the southwestern United States, and characteristic endospore-containing spherules are present on histology.
D. Phaeohyphomycosis – Correct. Phaeohyphomycosis describes infections with dematiaceous or phaeoid fungi that most commonly affect immunosuppressed patients. Dissemination can occur. Gomori methenamine silver staining showed numerous pigmented fungal spores and hyphae (Fig 3). The histology of phaeohyphomycosis is distinct from those of mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis. Here, a phaeoid fungus of the genus Exophiala was identified by fungal culture and polymerase chain reaction.
E. Bacillary angiomatosis – Incorrect. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by infection with Bartonella genus bacteria and typically presents with bright red papules and nodules in immunocompromised patients.

### Treatment of alopecia in children [^114QowXn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alopecia or hair loss in children is an important and often challenging problem to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key because hair loss in children has a significant physical as well as psychological impact on their development. Alopecia in children are mainly non-scarring, but cicatricial alopecia can also be seen. The diagnosis can usually be made by direct examination of the scalp. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of plucked hair and scalp scrapings, woods lamp examination and trichoscopy are useful diagnostic aids. When a cicatricial alopecia is suspected, scalp biopsy is recommended. Disease specific treatment should be initiated early and adequate counselling provided to both the patient and their parents. This review focuses on the treatment options available for various types of alopecia in children and their safety and efficacy data, analyzing the available literature evidences.

### Direct microscopy in the dermatology clinic: enhancing the management of skin infections and infestations [^111Ky1f6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpreting the sample

In the setting of a dermatology clinic, it is most likely that slides will be examined with bright‐field illumination using a compound light microscope; this is certainly the most straightforward approach. The use of fluorescence microscopy, with a stain such as Calcofluor white, makes it considerably easier to detect and visualize the structure of fungal elements; however, this requires a fluorescence microscope or additional equipment, both of which are expensive.

Initially the sample should be examined under low power (× 10) and relatively low illumination, scanning the entire specimen systematically. If fungal elements are detected, the brightness can be increased and magnification increased to × 20 or × 40 to obtain a better image.

All dermatophytes are morphologically indistinguishable in tissue; however, the presence of hyphae confirms fungal infection (Fig. 3a). Dermatophyte hyphae are typically narrow and uniform in width, with a thin cell wall and regular septa (divisions between fungal cells). Branching of hyphae can occur without septa or constriction at the branching point. Arthroconidia (round spores) may be observed, either individually or in chains of varying size. Dermatophyte hyphae obtained from nail specimens can have an irregular appearance with variation in hyphal width and fronding; however, a significant degree of fronding should prompt consideration of a nondermatophyte mould. Fronding refers to palm‐like branching at the ends of hyphae; for this reason it is also referred to as 'terminal fronding'. Hair infection caused by dermatophytes occurs in distinct patterns, which can recognized by the arrangement of conidia and/or hyphae in relation to the hair. The major distinction is between endothrix infection, where arthroconidia are contained within the hair shaft (Fig. 3b), and ectothrix infection, where arthroconidia are observed growing around the outside of the hair shaft (Fig. 3c). Ectothrix is further divided into small‐spored ectothrix (SSE) with spores 2–3 μm in diameter, and large‐spored ectothrix with spores 5–8 μm in diameter; however, this difference can be subtle and difficult to appreciate. Culture should always be performed; however, the pattern of hair invasion seen on microscopy provides a rapid indication of the likely causative organism. Endothrix infection is caused by anthropophilic Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton tonsurans and Trichophyton violaceum, which respond well to terbinafine. By contrast, SSE is caused by Microsporum species, including Microsporum audouinii (anthropophilic) and Microsporum canis (zoophilic), for which terbinafine is less effective, and griseofulvin or itraconazole would be the preferred treatments.

### Dothistroma septosporum and dothistroma pini, the causal agents of dothistroma needle blight, are infected by multiple viruses [^113mcfPg]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dothistroma needle blight (DNB), formerly known as red-band needle blight, is one of the most important foliar diseases of members of the Pinaceae family, affecting over 110 species, mainly Pinus spp. DNB is caused by two closely related fungal species, Dothistroma septosporum (Doroguine) Morelet and D. pini Hulbury. The former is most likely of Eurasian origin and currently has a worldwide distribution. Contrarily, its sister species, D. pini, has a more limited distribution and has been reported only in the USA and Europe. Both fungi cause similar symptoms, initiated as chlorosis progressing to necrosis of the distal part of the needle. A typical symptom is the appearance of red discolouration around the necrotic spots due to the accumulation of dothistromin, a toxin produced by the fungus. The disease culminates as a needle cast, which may induce tree death in extreme cases. Total losses due to DNB, only in the UK, including wood and non-wood damages, are estimated to be in tens of millions of GBP annually (for details, see). Given its importance, many different approaches to controlling and managing DNB have been suggested. More recently, the potential of spraying ultra-low volume aerial fungicides to control outbreaks of DNB in the UK has been highlighted. However, given the EU's strict regulations over pesticide usage in plantations and natural forests, there is urgent need for more environmentally friendly tools against tree pathogens. Employing mycoviruses, that reduce virulence of plant pathogen (hypovirulence), as biological control agents (BCAs) could be an attractive alternative against fungal pathogens.

### Wood you believe It? A case of a sporotrichosis mimic [^111BUMgo]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium marinum is an acid-fast bacillus. Human infection can occur when damaged skin is exposed to an aqueous environment that is contaminated by the organism. An infection with M marinum can present as painless purple nodules that spread along the lymphatics. Sporotrichosis presents similarly. We present a case of cutaneous M marinum infection in a patient from rural central Texas who developed lesions initially suspected to be sporotrichosis after she sustained a splinter wound of her right hand. Despite empirical treatment for sporotrichosis with itraconazole, the patient's condition worsened, prompting further investigation. A positive culture for M marinum altered the treatment plan. After a course of minocycline, the patient's cutaneous lesions resolved. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of M marinum infections, which can mimic conditions such as sporotrichosis. M marinum is an incredibly slow-growing organism in culture and requires a high degree of foresight for accurate diagnosis. Clinicians should consider M marinum in the differential diagnosis for patients with apparent sporotrichosis lesions, particularly those with a history of appropriate environmental exposure, even in regions distant from bodies of water or occupations not routinely in contact with aquatic organisms.

### Intertrigo and secondary skin infections [^112UoMMy]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory dermatitis occurring on two closely opposed skin surfaces as a result of moisture, friction, and lack of ventilation. Bodily secretions, including perspiration, urine, and feces, often exacerbate skin inflammation. Physical examination of skin folds reveals regions of erythema with peripheral scaling. Excessive friction and inflammation can cause skin breakdown and create an entry point for secondary fungal and bacterial infections, such as Candida, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Corynebacterium minutissimum. Candidal intertrigo is commonly diagnosed clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of satellite lesions. Diagnosis may be confirmed using a potassium hydroxide preparation. Resistant cases require oral fluconazole therapy. Bacterial superinfections may be identified with bacterial culture or Wood lamp examination. Fungal lesions are treated with topical nystatin, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or econazole. Secondary streptococcal infections are treated with topical mupirocin or oral penicillin. Corynebacterium infections are treated with oral erythromycin.

### Treatment-resistant bacterial keratitis: challenges and solutions [^111BQ7us]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Challenge of Diagnosis

The main signs and symptoms of bacterial keratitis are pain, redness, blurred vision, discharge, corneal infiltrates, ulcerations, photophobia, and anterior chamber inflammation. These symptoms and findings should be supported by medical history, and all of the above-mentioned risk factors should be evaluated by physical examination and slit-lamp examination.

Suppurative stromal infiltrates greater than 1 mm in diameter and located in the central cornea are suggestive of bacterial keratitis. These infiltrates have indistinct edges and are usually accompanied by edema and leukocyte infiltration. There is typically an epithelial defect, and anterior chamber reaction is also common.

Pain, rapid stromal thinning, and descemetocele should immediately suggest a Pseudomonas infection. Yellow-green purulent discharge and ground-glass appearance and loss of transparency in the adjacent corneal stroma are other important clinical features suggesting Pseudomonas. In cases of staphylococcal keratitis, the corneal ulcer is usually round and circumscribed by an epithelial defect, with minimal edema in the adjacent cornea. Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause serpiginous ulcers that infiltrate and span the cornea.

Cornea specialists can distinguish bacterial keratitis from fungal keratitis based on biomicroscopic appearance. In a study based on 80 photographs of keratitis cases (40 bacterial, 40 fungal) in which the etiological agent was confirmed by direct culture, Dalmon et alfound that 15 cornea specialists distinguished bacterial keratitis from fungal keratitis at a rate of 66%, correctly predicted Gram staining results at a rate of 46%, and predicted genus and species at rates of 25% and 10%, respectively. Although bacterial/fungal differentiation was better than by chance, predictions of Gram staining, genus, and species were very low. In routine practice, the predominant approach to community-acquired bacterial keratitis is empirical antibiotic therapy without obtaining smears or culture. However, clinical findings are not sufficient for the diagnosis of microbial keratitis and staining and culture remain the gold standard.

### Prospective study of the sensitivity of the wood's lamp for common eye abnormalities [^112csp5W]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Wood's lamp, a handheld instrument that uses long-wave ultraviolet (UV) light with magnification of 2–3 times, is commonly used by non-ophthalmologists for examining patients with eye complaints. The goal of current research was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Wood's lamp for common eye abnormalities.

Study Design

We examined a convenience sample of patients, 18 years of age and older, who presented for eye complaints to an urgent clinic of a large ophthalmology practice. This prospective observational trial was performed from December 2016 until July 2017. An ophthalmologist examined the patient's eyes with a Wood's lamp, followed by examination of the eyes using a slit lamp. The Wood's lamp was compared with the slit lamp, which served as the gold standard.

Results

There were 73 patients recruited. The mean age of study subjects (29 female and 44 male) was 49 years. The overall sensitivity of the Wood's lamp was 52% (38/73; 95%CI 40% to 64%). Based on the principal final diagnosis made with the slit lamp, the Wood's lamp only detected 9 of 16 corneal abrasions, 5 of 10 corneal ulcers, 5 of 9 corneal foreign bodies, 0 of 4 cases of non-herpetic keratitis, 1 of 2 cases of herpes keratitis, 1 of 5 rust rings and 18 of 28 other diagnoses.

Conclusions and Relevance

Examination using the Wood's lamp fails to detect many common eye abnormalities. Our findings support the need for a slit lamp examination of patients with eye complaints whenever possible.
