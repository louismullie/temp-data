## Question

fecal occult blood test what does it mean

Assistant: A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for hidden (occult) blood in the stool. A positive result indicates that blood was detected, but it doesn't necessarily pinpoint where the bleeding is coming from or whether it's serious.

### 1. Possible Causes
- **Hemorrhoids**: Can cause small amounts of blood to appear in the stool.
- **Gastrointestinal inflammation or ulcers**: Conditions like gastritis, esophagitis, or peptic ulcer disease.
- **Polyps or tumors**: Growths in the colon or rectum, some of which may be precancerous or cancerous, can lead to occult bleeding.
- **Other sources**: Sometimes certain foods or medications can affect the test.

### 2. Follow-Up
- **Repeat testing or diagnostic procedures**: Doctors may recommend a colonoscopy or other imaging studies.
- **Lifestyle and diet discussion**: Sometimes further questions about diet, medications, and family history are important.

A positive FOBT isn't a definite diagnosis. Only a qualified healthcare provider can interpret your specific results and advise further steps. Testing is crucial, but it's not enough on its own to confirm any condition.

should i worry about colon cancer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether they should worry about colon cancer after a positive fecal occult blood test and what the appropriate next steps are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a positive FOBT actually means and how often it reflects cancer. Then, I should verify the key risk factors that modify pretest probability. Next, I will review guideline-based next steps, especially the need for timely colonoscopy. After that, I should quantify benefits and harms to set expectations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and address common concerns like diet, medications, and timing of follow-up.

> Let me first confirm what a positive FOBT signifies. A positive test detects hidden blood in stool but does not diagnose cancer; it increases the likelihood of clinically significant colorectal neoplasia, including cancer and advanced adenomas, and the positive predictive value in average-risk populations typically ranges from about 3% to 8% for cancer and roughly one-third to one-half for advanced neoplasia, depending on the test and population, so most positives are not cancer but warrant evaluation [^14299dee] [^5dfa61f8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how risk factors shift the probability. Age is the dominant risk factor, with risk rising steadily after 50 and accelerating after 60, and family history of colorectal cancer or advanced adenomas in first-degree relatives roughly doubles risk; personal history of prior polyps or inflammatory bowel disease also elevates risk, whereas lifestyle factors like smoking, obesity, red/processed meat intake, and inactivity further increase baseline risk, so someone with multiple risk factors has a higher pretest probability than an average-risk person of the same age [^0b00cef9] [^718f3f4d].

> Next, I should review what to do now. I need to ensure we align with guidelines: any positive non-colonoscopy screening test, including FOBT or FIT, should be followed by a timely colonoscopy, ideally within weeks to a few months; delays beyond 10–12 months are associated with higher odds of cancer and more advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, so scheduling promptly is important even if you feel fine [^ec659a92] [^b2c64bb3] [^43829886].

> I will now examine the balance of benefits and harms to set expectations. On the benefit side, randomized trials show that screening with guaiac FOBT reduces colorectal cancer mortality by about 16–25% at the population level, and observational data suggest FIT may reduce mortality even more, while colonoscopy after a positive stool test can prevent cancer by removing precancerous polyps; on the harm side, colonoscopy carries a small risk of perforation and bleeding, and false positives can lead to unnecessary procedures, but overall the net benefit is favorable in average-risk adults aged 50–75 [^5bedebf6] [^0450aa39] [^35592bd6].

> But wait, what if the positive result is a false positive from diet or medications? Let me consider that carefully. High-sensitivity guaiac tests can be affected by red meat and some vegetables and by medications like aspirin, whereas FIT is generally not affected by diet or common drugs; importantly, repeating a positive stool test to "confirm" before colonoscopy is not recommended, so the appropriate action remains colonoscopy rather than repeating the stool test [^02b568e9] [^43829886].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. If you are average risk, a positive FOBT roughly doubles your short-term risk of having advanced neoplasia compared with someone with a negative test, but the absolute risk is still modest, so you should not panic; you should prioritize scheduling a colonoscopy within the next few months, bring a detailed medication and family history to your appointment, and avoid stopping aspirin or anticoagulants without your clinician's guidance, as that could be unsafe [^14299dee] [^b2c64bb3] [^ec659a92].

> If you have higher-risk features, I should confirm that your threshold for concern is appropriately lower. With a first-degree family history, prior polyps, or IBD, the pretest probability is higher, so a positive FOBT is more worrisome and strengthens the case for expedited colonoscopy; in some high-risk scenarios, colonoscopy is the preferred initial screening modality rather than stool testing, so your doctor may adjust the plan accordingly [^0b00cef9] [^a9ab3244].

> I should double-check age-related nuances. For adults 76–85, screening decisions should be individualized based on health status and life expectancy, and routine screening is generally discouraged after 85; for adults 45–49, evidence is mixed and some guidelines advise shared decision-making rather than routine screening, so a positive test in this younger group still warrants colonoscopy, but the baseline risk is lower and the chance of cancer is correspondingly lower than in older adults [^c9622bd5] [^1754394b] [^e88140eb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. A positive FOBT is not a cancer diagnosis, but it is a red flag that should not be ignored; the right next step is timely colonoscopy to find and remove polyps or detect cancer early, and the likelihood that this will help you is substantially higher than the small risks of the procedure, so you should act promptly and avoid delaying follow-up [^ec659a92] [^b2c64bb3] [^0450aa39].

A positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) means **hidden blood is present in the stool** [^12807867], which is not normal and may indicate bleeding anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract [^59e4c89d]. This is **not a diagnosis of cancer** [^5dfa61f8]; it is a screening signal that warrants further evaluation, most often with a colonoscopy [^ec659a92] to identify the source of bleeding and check for polyps, cancer, or other conditions [^c2bbe75a]. Common causes include hemorrhoids, polyps, ulcers, or colorectal cancer, so a positive result should be followed up promptly to determine the cause and guide treatment [^b2c64bb3].

---

## What does a positive FOBT indicate?

A positive FOBT indicates **occult gastrointestinal bleeding** — blood that is not visible to the naked eye [^12807867]. This bleeding can originate from anywhere in the GI tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum [^59e4c89d]. The test does not specify the location or cause of bleeding, so further diagnostic evaluation is necessary [^4e4df213].

---

## Common causes of a positive FOBT

Several conditions can cause a positive FOBT, including:

- **Hemorrhoids**: Swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that bleed during bowel movements [^59e4c89d].
- **Anal fissures**: Small tears in the lining of the anus.
- **Polyps**: Benign growths in the colon or rectum that may bleed [^e886bf7c].
- **Colorectal cancer**: Malignant tumors that can cause bleeding [^0450aa39].
- **Ulcers**: Open sores in the stomach or small intestine (peptic ulcers) [^59e4c89d].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Chronic inflammation of the colon or rectum, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^59e4c89d].
- **Upper gastrointestinal bleeding**: Bleeding from the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine [^59e4c89d].

---

## Limitations of the FOBT

While the FOBT is a useful screening tool, it has several limitations:

- **False positives**: Certain foods (e.g. red meat, raw vegetables), medications (e.g. aspirin, NSAIDs), and supplements (e.g. vitamin C) can cause false-positive results [^02b568e9].
- **False negatives**: Intermittent bleeding or bleeding from lesions not shedding blood into the stool can result in false-negative results [^5bedebf6].
- **Non-specificity**: The test detects blood but does not identify the source or cause of bleeding [^12807867].

---

## Recommended follow-up for a positive FOBT

A positive FOBT result **requires further evaluation** to determine the source and cause of bleeding [^ec659a92]. The standard follow-up is a colonoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the colon and rectum and enables biopsy or removal of suspicious lesions [^c2bbe75a]. If colonoscopy is contraindicated or declined, alternative tests such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, or barium enema may be considered [^69903420].

---

## Clinical significance of a positive FOBT

A positive FOBT is clinically significant because it may indicate underlying pathology, including colorectal cancer or precancerous polyps [^0450aa39]. Early detection of these conditions through appropriate follow-up can significantly improve patient outcomes, including survival rates and quality of life [^7c4d8b30].

---

## Conclusion

A positive fecal occult blood test indicates the presence of hidden blood in the stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding [^12807867]. It is **not a diagnosis of cancer** but a screening signal that requires further evaluation, typically with a colonoscopy [^ec659a92], to identify the source and cause of bleeding. Prompt follow-up is essential to rule out serious conditions such as colorectal cancer and to ensure appropriate treatment [^b2c64bb3].

In summary, high-quality scientific studies indicate that the use of the FOBT for colorectal cancer screening has a number of important advantages. The test is capable of detecting most early colorectal cancers and many advanced adenomas. It has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce substantially colorectal cancer mortality and incidence. The FOBT is feasible, widely available, and acceptable to most individuals. It has a low up-front cost and is highly cost-effective. Combining annual FOBT with periodic flexible sigmoidoscopy seems to be an especially effective screening option. Limitations of FOBT screening include its low sensitivity for polyps, especially smaller ones. Some of the trials report a relatively low sensitivity for detecting cancers located in the distal colon. The test has a relatively low specificity, so there are many false-positive screens; and for it to be most effective, repetitive screening is necessary. Balancing these advantages and disadvantages, the evidence-based screening guidelines have concluded that FOBT screening has a major role to play in colorectal cancer control and a program of annual FOBT plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is a preferred option for screening the asymptomatic, average-risk population for colorectal cancer. Short of doing direct colonoscopy screening for the entire at-risk population, the FOBT currently is the best available method of identifying asymptomatic, average-risk people most likely to benefit from colonoscopy.

### Fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer: open issues [^d0ff2bf7]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Data from seven case-control and — mainly — three randomized clinical trials consistently indicate that biennial fecal occult blood screening (FOBT) can reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality by approximately 20% after 10–18 years. The reduction may be greater in compliant subjects. In the long-term, incidence also appears to be reduced. There are suggestions that the effect of annual screening may be greater, although data are inadequate to quantify the potential advantages of annual versus biennial screening. The issue of the effectiveness of FOBT in the general population and, more important, of comparative cost-effectiveness with other possible screening tests for CRC, however, remain open to discussion.

### Many participants in fecal occult blood test population screening have a higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer [^2de99edc]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Population-based colorectal cancer screening by fecal occult blood testing reduces cancer-specific mortality. Current guidelines recommend this strategy for average risk individuals. This study investigated the prevalence of higher-than-average risk characteristics, and rate of prior colonoscopy, in participants in fecal occult blood test screening programs.

Methods

Randomly selected individuals aged 50–74 years in urban Adelaide were offered free fecal occult blood test screening by mail, without prior knowledge of their medical status. Each invitation included a questionnaire to record the prevalence of higher-than-average risk characteristics related to symptoms, family history or comorbidity, as well as prior colonoscopy. The definition of average risk was taken from updated guidelines published by the US Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.

Results

Of 2538 responses analyzed, 425 individuals had had a colonoscopy within the last 5 years, 106 fulfilled family history criteria for an initial screening colonoscopy, 209 had past polyps and 26 had had colorectal cancer. Eighty-three reported recent rectal bleeding. By current guidelines, 23% of the screened population did not warrant fecal occult blood test, because either prior colonoscopy rendered it unnecessary or particular patient characteristics made colonoscopy a more appropriate initial investigation.

Conclusions

Fecal occult blood test screening programs capture a sizeable number of higher-than-average risk individuals that may warrant colonoscopic rather than fecal occult blood test screening. Other participants have had a recent colonoscopy and probably warrant a delay in screening. Mass population fecal occult blood test-based screening programs need to more effectively target those at average risk and should divert those of higher or lower risk to more individualized assessment.

American Cancer Society 2018 colorectal cancer screening — average-risk adults: The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation, and the recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a strong recommendation; as part of the screening process, all positive results on non-colonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that 1) average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from continuing CRC screening. Options for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are listed as: fecal immunochemical test; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annual; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

### Colorectal cancer screening: clinical applications [^1d6af24e]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Screening for colorectal cancer reduces mortality in individuals aged 50 years or older. A number of screening tests, including fecal occult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy, are recommended by professional organizations for colorectal cancer screening, yet the rates of colorectal cancer screening remain low. Questions regarding the quality of evidence for each screening test, whether screening for individuals at higher risk should be modified, the availability of the tests, and cost-effectiveness are addressed. Many potential barriers to colorectal cancer screening exist for the patient and the physician. Strategies to increase compliance for colorectal cancer screening are proposed.

### Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^c3f0c49e]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Screening and surveillance substantially reduce both the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Screening of normal-risk individuals may be accomplished by several methods, including fecal occult blood testing, fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy, double contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy. New technologies for screening are being developed, such as fecal immunochemical testing for blood, fecal DNA testing, and virtual colonoscopy. Patients at increased risk for colorectal cancer, such as those with a positive family history, previous adenomatous polyps or cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease, should be offered more intensive evaluation and surveillance.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^a8b5afe2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for colorectal cancer.

Methods

To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review on 4 selected questions relating to test characteristics and benefits and harms of screening technologies, and 2) a decision analytic modeling analysis using population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of available screening modalities when used in a programmatic way over time.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary. (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 to 85 years of age. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient. (C recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than age 85 years. (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer. (I statement).

### Screening for colorectal cancer [^e0526521]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are several methods available for colon cancer screening, none is optimal. This article reviews methods for screening, including fecal occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT colonography, capsule endoscopy, and double contrast barium enema. A simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and relatively sensitive screening test is needed to identify people at risk for developing advanced adenomas or colorectal cancer who would benefit from colonoscopy. It is hoped that new markers will be identified that perform better. Until then we fortunately have a variety of screening strategies that do work.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^683f704e]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — interval fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) before scheduled surveillance is not advised after an adequate baseline colonoscopy. If the patient has an adequate baseline colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be based on the current guidelines, and patients should not have interval fecal blood testing if colonoscopy is planned. The task force recommends that interval fecal testing not be performed within the first 5 years after colonoscopy; there is currently insufficient evidence to support this practice, and the likelihood of false-positive test results is high, which would result in unnecessary early colonoscopies. If a fecal blood test is performed in the first 5 years after colonoscopy, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, and the clinician's judgment to repeat colonoscopy could consider the prior colonoscopy findings, completeness of examination and bowel preparation, and family history.

### Colon cancer screening strategies [^cb61a00a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Screening has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality related to colorectal cancer. However, the optimal strategy for population screening for colorectal cancer has been a topic of heated debate. Recent studies have challenged the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of current population screening practices. Novel approaches to improve the assessment of an individual's colorectal cancer risk and advances in technology are changing our approach to colorectal screening. This review covers current guidelines for screening for colorectal cancer, recent advances in cancer risk assessment, and the role of endoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and fecal DNA testing in colorectal cancer screening.

### Colon cancer screening and surveillance controversies [^c6f2fef9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss new colorectal cancer screening tests and highlight controversies regarding colon screening and surveillance.

Recent Findings

New screening guidelines were published in 2008. Tests that primarily detect early cancer include sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test. Tests that can detect both early cancer and cancer precursor lesions include sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. One guideline endorses the use of computed tomographic colonography. Limitations of each test are highlighted in the new guidelines. Controversies include age to start screening, age to stop screening, and appropriate interval after a negative screening colonoscopy. New work has raised some doubt about the protective effect of colonoscopy in the proximal colon. Finally, there is new emphasis on the quality of screening programs.

Summary

Colorectal cancer screening can reduce both incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer if performed with high quality. New work should focus on improving the quality of all screening programs.

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^7a987418]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) after normal colonoscopy is addressed by noting recommendations to suspend gFOBT for at least 10 years after a normal colonoscopy due to low positive predictive value of interval gFOBT for clinically significant colonic neoplasia, and that one study found only 1% of gFOBT-positive individuals had an advanced neoplasm when they had a negative screening colonoscopy within the past 5 years.

### Fecal occult blood test for evaluation of symptoms or for diagnostic testing [^4e4df213]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

This editorial discusses the role of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in a diagnostic workup. Utility of FOBT in colorectal cancer screening is well documented in multiple clinical trials, although there continues to be a debate (and ongoing trials) on its merit relative to other screening tests. Over the years, FOBT has seen growth in its application for assessment of symptomatic gastrointestinal disease without clear guidelines on its use in this setting. The work of Lee et al. in this edition of the journal synthesizes evidence on diagnostic utility of FOBT and provides additional rationale to stop using FOBTs for symptoms evaluation or for diagnostic testing.

### Utilization of a colorectal cancer screening test among individuals with average risk [^9c0f3eaa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What were the overall and test-specific colorectal cancer screening participation rates in the period before and after the introduction of the multitarget stool DNA assay?

Findings

In this cohort study of 97 776 individuals with average risk of colorectal cancer with commercial or Medicare supplemental insurance in the United States, adherence to colorectal cancer screening increased between 2011 and 2019. There was an increase in the adoption of the multitarget stool DNA assay and a decrease in fecal occult blood testing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that overall colorectal cancer screening rates are increasing over time and there are varied patterns of use for specific tests.

### Colon cancer screening strategies [^010bf1cf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Screening and prevention of colorectal cancer is a public health priority. Fecal occult blood testing is a popular screening test because of its simplicity, noninvasiveness, and demonstrated mortality benefit. At the same time, guaiac tests suffer from poor sensitivity, limited ability to detect early lesions, the need for annual testing, low population compliance, and high costs of follow-up for false-positive tests. These limitations have sparked many innovations in stool testing.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that both community intervention and physician awareness are needed to improve patient compliance with fecal occult blood testing and colorectal cancer screening in general. Despite the low costs of the guaiac test, the high false positives and high false negatives of fecal occult blood testing lead to high costs and low cost-effectiveness when compared with endoscopic techniques. Fecal DNA testing promises to improve the performance characteristics of stool testing. Small trials of multitarget assays demonstrate a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 62 to 91% and a sensitivity for adenomas of 26 to 73%. The specificity of these assays is high, ranging from 93 to 100%. The major drawback of fecal DNA testing, compared with other fecal colorectal cancer screening tests, is the cost.

Summary

Preliminary data on fecal DNA tests show better performance characteristics than fecal occult blood tests. In their current form, however, it is not clear that the added sensitivity merits the additional cost. These tests must be studied in larger cohorts of asymptomatic patients before adequate comparison can be made to established colorectal cancer screening techniques.

### Fecal immunochemical test screening and risk of colorectal cancer death [^441c3c28]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer deaths worldwide, and an estimated 152 810 individuals in the US received a diagnosis of CRC and 53 010 died from it in 2024. The US Preventive Services Task Force and other US organizations recommend annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening among average-risk individuals to reduce the risk of death from CRC. FIT is simple to use, usually completed at home without the need for an in-person visit, and can be analyzed in a standardized way. FIT is more sensitive for both CRC and adenomas than guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (g-FOBT) while being highly specific, and g-FOBT screening has also been shown to reduce the risk of CRC mortality.

FIT screening programs have reported reduced CRC incidence and mortality, but further evidence on effectiveness is limited. Observational studies of biennial FIT screening in Europe and Taiwan have compared CRC mortality risk between screened and unscreened individuals or people invited vs not invited to screen in people aged 50 to 65 or 50 to 71 years. However, those studies did not verify eligibility in all individuals and/or used incidence-based mortality rates that is subject to lead-time bias. Current trials of FIT have limited power, and/or are not designed to compare FIT screening with unscreened individuals. This contrasts with observational and randomized clinical trial evidence on g-FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Also, there are reasons to believe that FIT effectiveness may vary according to colon site, and by race and ethnicity given differences in social and structural barriers that influence care quality across the screening continuum.

We previously reported improved CRC incidence and mortality rates and narrowing of racial disparities in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) FIT-based screening program. This study examined whether completing FIT screening is associated with a lower risk of death from CRC overall, according to location in the colon, and by race and ethnicity. The approaches used in this study have previously generated findings that approximated randomized clinical trial results on sigmoidoscopy and g-FOBT.

### Screening for colorectal cancer using the faecal occult blood test, hemoccult [^5bedebf6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the Western world. The human and financial costs of this disease have prompted considerable research efforts to evaluate the ability of screening tests to detect the cancer at an early curable stage. Tests that have been considered for population screening include variants of the faecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. Reducing mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) may be achieved by the introduction of population-based screening programmes.

Objectives

To determine whether screening for colorectal cancer using the faecal occult blood test (guaiac or immunochemical) reduces colorectal cancer mortality and to consider the benefits, harms and potential consequences of screening.

Search Strategy

Published and unpublished data for this review were identified by: Reviewing studies included in the previous Cochrane review; Searching several electronic databases (Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Amed, SIGLE, HMIC); and Writing to the principal investigators of potentially eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

We included in this review all randomised trials of screening for colorectal cancer that compared faecal occult blood test (guaiac or immunochemical) on more than one occasion with no screening and reported colorectal cancer mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from the eligible trials were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary data analysis was performed using the group participants were originally randomised to ('intention to screen'), whether or not they attended screening; a secondary analysis adjusted for non-attendence. We calculated the relative risks and risk differences for each trial, and then overall, using fixed and random effects models (including testing for heterogeneity of effects). We identified nine articles concerning four randomised controlled trials and two controlled trials involving over 320,000 participants with follow-up ranging from 8 to 18 years.

Main Results

Combined results from the 4 eligible randomised controlled trials shows that participants allocated to screening had a 16% reduction in the relative risk of colorectal cancer mortality (RR 0.84, CI: 0.78–0.90). In the 3 studies that used biennial screening (Funen, Minnesota, Nottingham) there was a 15% relative risk reduction (RR 0.85, CI: 0.78–0.92) in colorectal cancer mortality. When adjusted for screening attendance in the individual studies, there was a 25% relative risk reduction (RR 0.75, CI: 0.66–0.84) for those attending at least one round of screening using the faecal occult blood test.

Authors' Conclusions

Benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve. Harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result, the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result, the possibility of overdiagnosis (leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment) and the complications associated with treatment.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^43829886]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Follow-up of positive noncolonoscopy screening tests — timeliness and management: Appropriate follow-up to a positive (noncolonoscopy) test is a timely colonoscopy, which is an integral part of the screening process and not complete until performed; repeating a positive stool-based test to decide on colonoscopy is not an appropriate screening strategy. In a retrospective cohort of 70,124 patients with a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT), no significant differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk were seen when colonoscopy occurred 7 to 9 months after FIT, but after delays of 10 months or more risks increased, and were even higher when delayed 12 months or more (odds ratio, 2.25 for any cancer and 3.22 for advanced-stage disease). Completion of follow-up is suboptimal: failure to complete colonoscopy within 12 months has been documented in more than one-half of patients in some settings, and across 4 U.S. health systems colonoscopy follow-up at 12 months varied from 58% to 83%.

### Annual fecal occult blood testing can be safely suspended for up to 5 years after a negative colonoscopy in asymptomatic average-risk patients [^1b0621cf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is often continued in patients who have had a recent negative colonoscopy, despite recommendations to the contrary. This prospective study aimed to determine the proportion of patients with a positive FOBT who had adenomas and cancers on colonoscopy stratified according to the duration of time since the last negative colonoscopy.

Methods

A total of 1,119 asymptomatic average-risk patients ≥ 50 years of age referred for a positive FOBT were prospectively identified and stratified by the duration of time since the last colonoscopy (never, > 10 years, 5–10 years, or < 5 years). The proportion of patients in each category with adenomas of any size, adenomas ≥ 10mm, advanced neoplasms, and cancers was assessed.

Results

The mean age (68.9 ± 9.6 years), sex (95.2% male), and race (48.1% white, 32.1% black, 15.6% Hispanic, and 4.2% other) did not differ between the four groups. Overall, adenomas of any size were detected in 42.8% of patients, adenomas ≥ 10mm in 14.7%, advanced neoplasms in 20.7%, and cancers in 7.3%. Advanced neoplasms were detected in 30.4% of patients who have never had a colonoscopy, 27% in those who have had one greater than 10 years prior, 10.0% in 5–10 years prior, and 1.1% in less than 5 years prior.

Conclusions

In asymptomatic average-risk patients with a negative colonoscopy within the last 5 years, the prevalence of adenomas is low, and no patient was diagnosed with cancer. These findings support the CDC recommendations to suspend annual FOBT for up to 5 years after a negative colonoscopy.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^35592bd6]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness, diagnostic accuracy, and harms of screening for CRC.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014, with surveillance through February 23, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting CRC or adenomas, and serious adverse events.

Results

Four pragmatic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating 1-time or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy (n = 458,002) were associated with decreased CRC-specific mortality compared with no screening (incidence rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.82). Five RCTs with multiple rounds of biennial screening with guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (n = 419,966) showed reduced CRC-specific mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98, at 19.5 years to RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93, at 30 years). Seven studies of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) with bowel preparation demonstrated per-person sensitivity and specificity to detect adenomas 6 mm and larger comparable with colonoscopy (sensitivity from 73% [95% CI, 58%-84%] to 98% [95% CI, 91%-100%]; specificity from 89% [95% CI, 84%-93%] to 91% [95% CI, 88%-93%]); variability and imprecision may be due to differences in study designs or CTC protocols. Sensitivity of colonoscopy to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger ranged from 75% (95% CI, 63%-84%) to 93% (95% CI, 88%-96%). On the basis of a single stool specimen, the most commonly evaluated families of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) demonstrated good sensitivity (range, 73%-88%) and specificity (range, 90%-96%). One study (n = 9989) found that FIT plus stool DNA test had better sensitivity in detecting CRC than FIT alone (92%) but lower specificity (84%). Serious adverse events from colonoscopy in asymptomatic persons included perforations (4/10,000 procedures, 95% CI, 2–5 in 10,000) and major bleeds (8/10,000 procedures, 95% CI, 5–14 in 10,000). Computed tomographic colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation exposure or identification of extracolonic findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CTC, and stool tests have differing levels of evidence to support their use, ability to detect cancer and precursor lesions, and risk of serious adverse events in average-risk adults. Although CRC screening has a large body of supporting evidence, additional research is still needed.

### Progress and challenges in colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^94656af4]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. There is evidence that screening of average-risk individuals can result in mortality reduction with early cancer detection and cancer prevention by detection and removal of cancer precursor lesions. The optimal form of screening is not clear. Fecal screening tests can be performed at home at low initial cost, but current versions lack high sensitivity for cancer precursor lesions, and tests need to be repeated at regular intervals. Adherence to repeat testing for negative tests and referral for colonoscopy for positive tests are important elements of program effectiveness. Structural examinations of the colon are more invasive and may result in detection of both early cancer and cancer precursor lesions. Every screening program has advantages and limitations, but each program ultimately depends on quality and patient adherence.

### Implementation of colon cancer screening: techniques, costs, and barriers [^0adc9b27]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer and breast cancer are the only cancer sites for which evidence on the efficacy of screening is available from randomized trials. The trials on colon cancer screening in the United States and Europe used the fecal occult blood test as the primary screen, but randomized trial data are not yet available on endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm), and no randomized, controlled trials of colonoscopy as a screening test are in progress. This article reviews colorectal cancer screening from an epidemiologist's perspective to provide the theoretic evidence-based underpinning for the role of the gastroenterologist in colorectal screening.

### Association between time to colonoscopy after a positive fecal test result and risk of colorectal cancer and cancer stage at diagnosis [^b2c64bb3]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is commonly used for colorectal cancer screening and positive test results require follow-up colonoscopy. However, follow-up intervals vary, which may result in neoplastic progression.

Objective

To evaluate time to colonoscopy after a positive FIT result and its association with risk of colorectal cancer and advanced-stage disease at diagnosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study (January 1, 2010-December 31, 2014) within Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California. Participants were 70 124 patients aged 50 through 70 years eligible for colorectal cancer screening with a positive FIT result who had a follow-up colonoscopy.

Exposures

Time (days) to colonoscopy after a positive FIT result.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk of any colorectal cancer and advanced-stage disease (defined as stage III and IV cancer). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were adjusted for patient demographics and baseline risk factors.

Results

Of the 70 124 patients with positive FIT results (median age, 61 years [IQR, 55–67 years]; men, 52.7%), there were 2191 cases of any colorectal cancer and 601 cases of advanced-stage disease diagnosed. Compared with colonoscopy follow-up within 8 to 30 days (n = 27 176), there were no significant differences between follow-up at 2 months (n = 24 644), 3 months (n = 8666), 4 to 6 months (n = 5251), or 7 to 9 months (n = 1335) for risk of any colorectal cancer (cases per 1000 patients: 8–30 days, 30; 2 months, 28; 3 months, 31; 4–6 months, 31; and 7–9 months, 43) or advanced-stage disease (cases per 1000 patients: 8–30 days, 8; 2 months, 7; 3 months, 7; 4–6 months, 9; and 7–9 months, 13). Risks were significantly higher for examinations at 10 to 12 months (n = 748) for any colorectal cancer (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.05–2.08]; 49 cases per 1000 patients) and advanced-stage disease (OR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.14–3.42]; 19 cases per 1000 patients) and more than 12 months (n = 747) for any colorectal cancer (OR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.89–2.68]; 76 cases per 1000 patients) and advanced-stage disease (OR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.44–4.25]; 31 cases per 1000 patients).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with a positive fecal immunochemical test result, compared with follow-up colonoscopy at 8 to 30 days, follow-up after 10 months was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer and more advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis. Further research is needed to assess whether this relationship is causal.

### The effect of fecal occult-blood screening on the incidence of colorectal cancer [^e886bf7c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both annual testing for fecal occult blood and biennial testing significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer. However, the effect of screening on the incidence of colorectal cancer remains uncertain, despite the diagnosis and removal of precancerous lesions in many persons who undergo screening.

Methods

We followed the participants in the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study for 18 years. A total of 46,551 people, most of whom were 50 to 80 years old, were enrolled between 1975 and 1978 and randomly assigned to annual screening, biennial screening, or usual care (the control group). Those assigned to the screening groups were asked to prepare and submit two samples from each of three consecutive stools for guaiac-based testing. Those with at least one positive slide in the set of six were offered a diagnostic examination that included colonoscopy. Screening was conducted between 1976 and 1982 and again between 1986 and 1992. Study participants have been followed with respect to newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer and deaths. Follow-up has been more than 90 percent complete.

Results

During the 18-year follow-up period, we identified 1359 new cases of colorectal cancer: 417 in the annual-screening group, 435 in the biennial-screening group, and 507 in the control group. The cumulative incidence ratios for colorectal cancer in the screening groups as compared with the control group were 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.90) and 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.94) for the annual-screening and biennial-screening groups, respectively. For both screening groups, the number of positive slides was associated with the positive predictive value both for colorectal cancer and for adenomatous polyps at least 1 cm in diameter.

Conclusions

The use of either annual or biennial fecal occult-blood testing significantly reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer.

### Colorectal cancer screening and prevention [^718f3f4d]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. The annual incidence has decreased since the 1980s. However, in the past 25 years, the incidence in adults 40 to 49 years of age, although low, has increased by 15%. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults with average risk and no signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer undergo periodic screening from 45 to 75 years of age. Starting screening or surveillance at an earlier age should be considered in patients with a prior diagnosis of adenomatous polyps or inflammatory bowel disease, a history of radiation to the abdomen or pelvis to treat a prior cancer, any genetic disorder that predisposes the patient to a high lifetime risk of cancer, or a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps. Recommended screening modalities include stool-based fecal immunochemical tests, which can also include DNA analysis, and direct visualization via computed tomography colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. Blood-based testing has low sensitivity and high cost and is therefore a second-line screening option performed only when the patient declines all first-line tests. Physicians should emphasize to patients that regular screening is a powerful tool for preventing colorectal cancer and highlight modifiable risk factors, which include staying at a healthy weight; performing moderate to vigorous physical activity; eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and low in red and processed meats; not drinking alcohol; and not smoking.

### Factors associated with colorectal cancer screening via immunochemical fecal occult blood test in an average-risk population from a multiethnic, middle-income setting [^03600a38]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of Colorectal Cancer and Its Screening

For the knowledge of colorectal cancer symptoms, there were nine close-ended items where the respondents had the options to answer yes" or "no" comprising bleeding from back passage or rectal, persistent abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, tenesmus, blood in stools, pain in back passage, lump in abdomen, lethargy (anemia), and unexplained weight loss. Each correct answer was given one mark. A total score ≤ 4 was considered as poor and ≥ 5 as good knowledge.

Risk factors were assessed using 10 questions based on a 5-point Likert scale from definitely agree (scored 1), agree (scored 1), do not know (scored 0), disagree (scored 0), and definitely disagree (scored 0). The accepted answers included alcohol consumption > 1 unit per day; low-fiber, vegetables, and fruit intake; high red meat and/or processed food consumption; obesity; being > 70 years of age; a positive family history of colorectal cancer; lack of physical activities or exercise; inflammatory bowel disease; and diabetes mellitus. The total score was then categorized into good (score ≥ 5) and poor (score ≤ 4).

For the knowledge of screening, colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, colon capsule endoscopy, and barium enema were listed. A score of 1 was given for each test correctly recognized by the respondents (score 1: poor knowledge and score ≥ 2: good knowledge).

### Beyond the scope: an update on colon cancer screening tests [^85a67cb9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common and rising among persons under age 50, but screening uptake is sub-optimal, particularly in 45–49 year-olds. Death from CRC can be prevented through detection and removal of advanced precancerous colorectal lesions (APLS) or detection of CRC at an early stage. In this review, we cover average-risk CRC screening options and present a framework for test selection in different clinical settings.

Recent Findings

The optimal CRC screening test should be highly sensitive for APLs and early stage CRC, easy to access, affordable to patient and payers, and appropriate for screening settings. Organized screening is administered systematically on the population-level, while opportunistic screening relies on individual provider-patient shared decision making. In addition to established options such as fecal immunochemical testing, multitarget stool DNA testing, and colonoscopy, novel options include stool-based RNA testing, next-generation stool-based DNA testing, and blood-based DNA testing. Although blood-based tests may be convenient, their low sensitivity for APLs can unintentionally lead to negative consequences for CRC prevention.

Summary

Uptake, cost, and efficacy of established and novel CRC screening tests influence the modality of choice for specific screening settings. Colonoscopy and stool-based tests should generally be first-line for CRC screening.

Importance

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US.

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness, test accuracy, and harms of screening for CRC to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1, 2015, to December 4, 2019; surveillance through March 26, 2021.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting cancers or adenomas, and serious adverse events.

Results

The review included 33 studies (n = 10 776 276) on the effectiveness of screening, 59 (n = 3 491 045) on the test performance of screening tests, and 131 (n = 26 987 366) on the harms of screening. In randomized clinical trials (4 trials, n = 458 002), intention to screen with 1- or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy vs no screening was associated with a decrease in CRC-specific mortality (incidence rate ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.68–0.80]). Annual or biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) vs no screening (5 trials, n = 419 966) was associated with a reduction of CRC-specific mortality after 2 to 9 rounds of screening (relative risk at 19.5 years, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84–0.98]; relative risk at 30 years, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65–0.93]). In observational studies, receipt of screening colonoscopy (2 studies, n = 436 927) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (1 study, n = 5.4 million) vs no screening was associated with lower risk of CRC incidence or mortality. Nine studies (n = 6497) evaluated the test accuracy of screening computed tomography (CT) colonography, 4 of which also reported the test accuracy of colonoscopy; pooled sensitivity to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger was similar between CT colonography with bowel prep (0.86) and colonoscopy (0.89). In pooled values, commonly evaluated FITs (14 studies, n = 45 403) (sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.94) and stool DNA with FIT (4 studies, n = 12 424) (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.85) performed better than high-sensitivity gFOBT (2 studies, n = 3503) (sensitivity, 0.50–0.75; specificity, 0.96–0.98) to detect cancers. Serious harms of screening colonoscopy included perforations (3.1/10 000 procedures) and major bleeding (14.6/10 000 procedures). CT colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation. It is unclear if detection of extracolonic findings on CT colonography is a net benefit or harm.

Conclusions and Relevance

There are several options to screen for colorectal cancer, each with a different level of evidence demonstrating its ability to reduce cancer mortality, its ability to detect cancer or precursor lesions, and its risk of harms.

### Vital signs: colorectal cancer screening test use-United States, 2018 [^4bcb24e6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of cancers that affect both men and women, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2016, 141,270 cases were diagnosed, and 52,286 persons died from the disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults at average risk (those who do not have a personal or family history of CRC or polyps, do not have inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of genetic syndromes associated with CRC) aged 50–75 years be screened for CRC by any of six available tests: 1) fecal occult blood test (FOBT), 2) fecal immunochemical test (FIT), 3) multitarget stool DNA (FIT-DNA), 4) computed tomographic colonography (CTC), 5) sigmoidoscopy, or 6) colonoscopy. Strong evidence exists that screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality. Both CRC incidence and mortality have declined steadily over the past 30 years; the decline is attributable in part to the increasing percentage of adults aged 50–75 years who are up to date with CRC screening (i.e. have completed a CRC screening test within the recommended time interval). Despite steady gains, the prevalence of CRC screening is lower than the stated national Healthy People 2020 target of 70.5%, and not all populations have achieved equivalent gains in CRC screening. This report describes current CRC screening among U.S. adults aged 50–75 years, by demographic characteristics and state.

### Familial risk of colorectal cancer in subjects attending an organised screening programme [^1fc6bda5]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

First degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients are at increased risk for the same disease.

Aims

To evaluate the prevalence of familial risk and its association with the occurrence of pathological significant lesions in subjects with positive faecal occult blood testing leading to colonoscopy.

Methods

Faecal occult blood testing is offered biennially to subjects aged 50–70. Subjects with a positive faecal test are invited to undergo colonoscopy. Familial history for colorectal cancer in subjects undergoing colonoscopy was routinely recorded.

Results

From 1995 to 2009, 4833 screenees with positive faecal occult blood test undergoing colonoscopy were enrolled. Twelve percent reported a positive first degree family history. Multivariate analysis evidenced that the probability of detecting pathological significant lesions was statistically associated with age, gender, type of test, repeated or first screening, and having at least 1 first degree relative with colorectal cancer.

Conclusions

Subjects attending colonoscopy reporting a positive first degree family history are at increased risk for pathologically significant lesions.

Stool test collection and low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) use guidance — All manufacturers of stool tests recommend that CRC screening stool samples be collected at home, and because of low sensitivity and lack of validation when using an office-collected digital rectal examination sample, CRC screening guidelines recommend against in-office testing with stool collected during digital rectal examination. Due to poor performance, nonrehydrated, low-sensitivity gFOBT variants cannot be recommended and should not be used for CRC screening. National surveys indicate overall stool testing use is low; in 2015, 7.2% of US adults used an office test and 7.5% used a home test as part of stool testing in the United States.

Although stool-based tests and colonoscopy screening may be useful for secondary prevention of EOCRC, there is no consensus on the optimal screening methods or the recommended age to begin screening for average-risk or high-risk populations. Individuals who test positive on stool-based tests but do not undergo follow-up colonoscopy have a significantly increased risk of CRC incidence and mortality, particularly among those under 50 years of age. Given the rising incidence of EOCRC, the American Cancer Society revised its guidelines in 2018, lowering the recommended screening age from 50 to 45 for average-risk individuals, while recommending that high-risk individuals begin screening by age 40. However, adherence to these recommendations among younger individuals remains low. While ideally, screening should be tailored to individual risk, CRC screening has yet to incorporate personalized risk assessment. Evaluating genetic polymorphisms, early-life exposures, and their environmental interactions could improve the efficiency of EOCRC screening and early detection. Despite the increasing incidence of CRC among younger populations, the absolute incidence remains significantly lower than in older populations. Thus, whether current screening methods are appropriate for younger individuals remains uncertain, and evidence is limited. For young individuals, using risk scores to guide screening modality selection (e.g. stool-based tests followed by colonoscopy for high-risk subgroups) could reduce reliance on invasive procedures, representing a promising strategy. However, existing CRC risk prediction models require further optimization and validation with more data before they can be effectively applied.

For modalities beyond these, "the evidence of benefit for all other screening tests is limited to test performance data" and observational studies; therefore, the guideline development group (GDG) "adopted evidence-based inferential reasoning" to extend support for fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and multitarget stool DNA test analysis (mt-sDNA) based on occult blood detection, and FS RCTs provide "proof of concept" for structural evaluation.

### Screening for colorectal neoplasms with new fecal occult blood tests: update on performance characteristics [^9435a2f0]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Background

One type of fecal occult blood test (FOBT), the unrehydrated guaiac fecal occult blood test (GT), is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Institute of Medicine for use in screening programs, but it has relatively low sensitivity as a single test for detecting advanced colonic neoplasms (cancer and adenomatous polyps ≥ 1 cm in diameter). Thus, improving the sensitivity of FOBT should make colon cancer screening programs that use these tests more effective.

Methods

We assessed prospectively the performance characteristics of two newer FOBTs in 5841 subjects at average risk for colorectal cancer in a large group-model managed care organization. The tests evaluated included a sensitive GT, a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and the combination of both tests. Patients with positive and negative test results were advised to have colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting advanced neoplasms in the left colon within 2 years after the FOBT screening were evaluated for the two tests administered separately and in combination.

Results

A total of 139 patients were diagnosed with advanced colorectal neoplasms (n = 14 cancers, n = 128 adenomas) within the 2 years following their initial FOBT screening. Sensitivity for detecting cancer was 81.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 47.8% to 96.8%) for the FIT alone and 64.3% (95% CI = 35.6% to 86.0%) for the sensitive GT and the combination test. Sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal adenomas was 41.3% (95% CI = 32.7% to 50.4%) for the sensitive GT, 29.5% (95% CI = 21.4% to 38.9%) for the FIT, and 22.8% (95% CI = 16.1% to 31.3%) for the combination test. Specificity for detecting cancer and adenomas was 98.1% (95% CI = 97.7% to 98.4%) and 98.4% (95% CI = 98.0% to 98.7%), respectively, for the combination test; 96.9% (95% CI = 96.4% to 97.4%) and 97.3% (95% CI = 96.8% to 97.7%), respectively, for the FIT; and 90.1% (95% CI = 89.3% to 90.8%) and 90.6% (95% CI = 89.8% to 91.4%), respectively, for the sensitive GT.

Conclusions

The FIT has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting left-sided colorectal cancer, and it may be a useful replacement for the GT.

### Screening colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing practice patterns: a population-based survey of gastroenterologists [^9273170c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines advocate the performance of colonoscopy at 10-year intervals in average-risk patients. Gastroenterologists' acceptance of 10-year intervals between colonoscopies and interim utilization of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is largely unknown.

Methods

A survey instrument of 15 multiple choice items following brief clinical scenarios involving different CRC screening strategies was sent to 72 practicing gastroenterologists in New Haven County, Connecticut to define screening colonoscopy and FOBT utilization practice patterns.

Results

The overall survey response rate was 75%. Eighty percent of respondents recommend a 10-year screening interval in average-risk patients after normal colonoscopy. Fifty-two percent of respondents recommend annual FOBT beginning 1 to 5 years after a normal screening colonoscopy and, if positive, 59% would evaluate further with colonoscopy and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Repeat colonoscopy in a patient with a family history of colon cancer in a first-degree relative at age 64, was recommended in 3 years by 9%, 5 years (67%), and 7 to 10 years (24%). Repeat colonoscopy in an average-risk patient with a suboptimal bowel preparation was recommended at the next available appointment by 17%, 1 year (20%), 3 years (28%), and in 5 to 7 years (35%).

Conclusions

Most gastroenterologists adhere to colon cancer screening practice guidelines regarding the timing of repeat evaluation in average-risk patients. A range of surveillance intervals was recommended in patients with greater-than-average CRC risk and a suboptimal bowel preparation. A majority of gastroenterologists use interim FOBT and evaluate positive results with additional endoscopic procedures that increase the frequency of surveillance examinations.

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^14299dee]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) diagnostic performance — sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) — varies with hemoglobin cut-off and across populations. Using colonoscopy as the gold standard, sensitivities for advanced adenoma ranged from 25% to 56%, with specificities from 68% to 96% in 1319 average-risk subjects, and lowering cut-offs (20 to 10 μg/g; 14 to 2 μg/g) increased sensitivity while decreasing specificity in asymptomatic cohorts. Across populations, PPV of FIT for cancer ranged from 2.9% to 7.8% and for advanced neoplasia from 33.9% to 54%, and a positive FIT substantially increased the yield of colonoscopy relative to screening colonoscopy, in which cancer (0.5%–1%) and advanced neoplasia (5%–10%) are detected less frequently.

### Beat colon cancer mortality? Yes we can! [^397d1294]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Summary

The New England Journal of Medicine published the results of the National polyp surveillance (NPS) study in reference to colon cancer mortality among patients with colonic adenomas. This is a prospective study of 2,602 patients who were enrolled from 1980 to 1990 to undergo colonoscopy and followed up for a median time of 15.8 years, with a maximum of 23 years. Only higher-risk patients were enrolled (positive findings on barium enema or sigmoidoscopy, positive fecal occult blood test, patients with symptoms, positive family history for colon cancer), all polyps were removed and this study was performed in centers of excellence. Among patients in whom adenomas were removed, 12 deaths from colon cancer occurred in this follow-up period whereas 25.4 deaths were expected in the carefully matched controls of the general population. Previously, these authors had demonstrated that the removal of adenomatous polyps reduced the expected incidence of colorectal cancer. This study emphasizes that the colonic cancers that were prevented were clinically meaningful and led to the anticipated but now proven 53% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c2bbe75a]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF colorectal cancer screening strategies — recommended methods and intervals are: high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) every year; fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year; stool DNA test with fecal immunochemical test (sDNA-FIT) every 1 to 3 y; colonoscopy every 10 y; computed tomography (CT) colonography every 5 y; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 y; and flexible sigmoidoscopy with FIT as flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 y plus FIT every year. Evidence notes include randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence that gFOBT reduces colorectal cancer mortality, cohort evidence that colonoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality, RCT evidence that flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer mortality, and RCT evidence that flexible sigmoidoscopy + FIT reduces colorectal cancer mortality, while there is no direct evidence evaluating the effect of sDNA-FIT or CT colonography on colorectal cancer mortality. To achieve the benefits of screening, abnormal results from stool-based tests, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy should be followed up with colonoscopy.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaColorectal cancer Screening [^69903420]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding colorectal screening with imaging. For individuals at average or moderate risk for colorectal cancer, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening. After positive results on a fecal occult blood test or immunohistochemical test, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer detection. For individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn colitis), optical colonoscopy is preferred because of its ability to obtain biopsies to detect dysplasia. After incomplete colonoscopy, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening for individuals at average, moderate, or high risk. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Reduced risk of colorectal cancer up to 10 years after screening, surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy [^bf837123]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Data from randomized controlled trials on the effects of screening colonoscopies on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are not available. Observational studies have suggested that colonoscopies strongly reduce the risk of CRC, but there is little specific evidence on the effects of screening colonoscopies.

Methods

We performed a population-based case-control study of 3148 patients with a first diagnosis of CRC (cases) and 3274 subjects without CRC (controls) from the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany from 2003 to 2010. Detailed information on previous colonoscopy and potential confounding factors was collected by standardized personal interviews. Self-reported information on colonoscopies and their indications was validated by medical records. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between colonoscopy conducted for specific indications within the past 10 years and risk of CRC.

Results

A history of colonoscopy was associated with a reduced subsequent risk of CRC, independently of the indication for the examination. However, somewhat stronger associations were found for examinations with screening indications (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.13) than for examinations with diagnostic indications, such as positive fecal occult blood test result (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.57), surveillance after a preceding colonoscopy (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24–0.45), rectal bleeding (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.20–0.40), abdominal symptoms (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10–0.21), or other (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.14–0.30). Colonoscopy was also associated with a reduced risk of cancer in the right colon, regardless of the indication, although to a smaller extent than for other areas of the colon (OR for screening colonoscopy, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14–0.33).

Conclusions

In a population-based case-control study, the risk of CRC was strongly reduced up to 10 years after colonoscopy for any indication. Risk was particularly low after screening colonoscopy, even for cancer in the right colon.

### Association between colorectal cancer mortality and gradient fecal hemoglobin concentration in colonoscopy noncompliers [^8ebb6054]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 10% of all cancers worldwide. In an effort to reduce mortality rates, several countries have adopted mass screening for CRC using either the fecal occult blood test or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. The superior performance and unique quantitative property of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) render it feasible for population-based screening.

Despite the widespread use of FIT in population-based screening, its effectiveness in reducing mortality from CRC is contingent upon the successful completion of a colonoscopic examination, a procedure that can directly reduce the mortality rate for those with positive test results. Therefore, an evaluation of the efficacy of FIT in reducing CRC mortality essentially amounts to an evaluation of the efficacy of colonoscopy for FIT-positive patients, assuming the sensitivity of FIT and colonoscopy compliance are both 100%.

Unfortunately, in population-based screening programs, some 10% to 20% of people in whom FIT is positive decline subsequent colonoscopy, substantially reducing the effectiveness of screening. The best way to address this problem is to fully educate colonoscopy candidates about the risk of CRC if they do not receive this procedure. An alternative approach is to focus on individuals with the highest risk of developing CRC so that resources allocated to tracking and counseling patients may be used efficiently.

While a perfect scenario may be unachievable, FIT-positive patients not referred for colonoscopy may serve as a comparator group to evaluate the efficacy of colonoscopy following a positive FIT. In addition, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing the mortality rate of patients with cancers of the proximal colon. Furthermore, no evidence has been presented quantifying the benefit of colonoscopy in patients with positive FIT, considering that the screening test may diagnose the cancer earlier but with no effect on the outcome (ie, the lead time bias).

In light of the increased incidence of CRC, a nationwide screening program was launched in Taiwan in 2004 (3,5). The primary aim of this study was to quantify the increased risk in mortality in those who did not receive colonoscopic follow-up after a positive FIT compared with those who did. We also determined whether fecal quantities of hemoglobin could serve as a priority-setting tool for referral to colonoscopy.

### Fecal immunochemical test screening and risk of colorectal cancer death [^8f4cd32a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study was in 2 health care systems that have systematically delivered organized screening to a well-defined member population using population health management strategies for about 1.5 decades. FIT effectiveness in clinical practice depends upon receiving follow-up colonoscopy when the FIT result is abnormal. In the population studied, about 20% of people had not undergone a follow-up colonoscopy within 12 months of the result date. Although that follow-up rate is among the highest reported in the US, any failures to receive follow-up could diminish the potential effectiveness of FIT screening on reducing CRC mortality.

Our results are also similar to prior observational studies despite differences in settings, methods, populations, screening delivery (annual vs biennial), and age groups studied. Chiu et alfound a lower risk of CRC death overall (adjusted rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57–0.64), for left colon cancers (adjusted rate ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.53–0.69), and right colon cancers (adjusted rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.66–0.80) after up to 10 years of follow-up in Taiwan's national biennial screening program. The pooled analysis of g-FOBT trials reported a 25% reduction in CRC death among people who completed at least 1 screening round. Our estimated 33% lower risk may reflect that FIT has higher sensitivity and specificity. We leveraged the diversity of our population to report estimates that varied from 29% to 63% overall lower risk of CRC death in association with FIT screening across the racial and ethnic groups.

### Colorectal cancer screening with faecal immunochemical testing, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy: a clinical practice guideline [^a8b00d46]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Recent 15-year updates of sigmoidoscopy screening trials provide new evidence on the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening. Prompted by the new evidence, we asked: "Does colorectal cancer screening make an important difference to health outcomes in individuals initiating screening at age 50 to 79? And which screening option is best?"

Current Practice

Numerous guidelines recommend screening, but vary on recommended test, age and screening frequency. This guideline looks at the evidence and makes recommendations on screening for four screening options: faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year, FIT every two years, a single sigmoidoscopy, or a single colonoscopy.

Recommendations

These recommendations apply to adults aged 50–79 years with no prior screening, no symptoms of colorectal cancer, and a life expectancy of at least 15 years. For individuals with an estimated 15-year colorectal cancer risk below 3%, we suggest no screening (weak recommendation). For individuals with an estimated 15-year risk above 3%, we suggest screening with one of the four screening options: FIT every year, FIT every two years, a single sigmoidoscopy, or a single colonoscopy (weak recommendation). With our guidance we publish the linked research, a graphic of the absolute harms and benefits, a clear description of how we reached our value judgments, and linked decision aids.

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, content experts and methodologists produced these recommendations using GRADE and in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines. A linked systematic review of colorectal cancer screening trials and microsimulation modelling were performed to inform the panel of 15-year screening benefits and harms. The panel also reviewed each screening option's practical issues and burdens. Based on their own experience, the panel estimated the magnitude of benefit typical members of the population would value to opt for screening and used the benefit thresholds to inform their recommendations.

The Evidence

Overall there was substantial uncertainty (low certainty evidence) regarding the 15-year benefits, burdens and harms of screening. Best estimates suggested that all four screening options resulted in similar colorectal cancer mortality reductions. FIT every two years may have little or no effect on cancer incidence over 15 years, while FIT every year, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy may reduce cancer incidence, although for FIT the incidence reduction is small compared with sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. Screening related serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events are rare. The magnitude of the benefits is dependent on the individual risk, while harms and burdens are less strongly associated with cancer risk.

Understanding The Recommendation

Based on benefits, harms, and burdens of screening, the panel inferred that most informed individuals with a 15-year risk of colorectal cancer of 3% or higher are likely to choose screening, and most individuals with a risk of below 3% are likely to decline screening. Given varying values and preferences, optimal care will require shared decision making.

It is recommended that all patients with colon cancer be queried regarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, and results from a randomized controlled trial suggest that most individuals without a personal history of CRC and with one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC diagnosed at any age can safely be screened with colonoscopy every 6 years.

Fecal occult-blood testing and sigmoidoscopy have been recommended for screening for colorectal cancer, but the sensitivity of such combined testing for detecting neoplasia is uncertain. At 13 Veterans Affairs medical centers, we performed colonoscopy to determine the prevalence of neoplasia and the sensitivity of one-time screening with a fecal occult-blood test plus sigmoidoscopy.

Methods

Asymptomatic subjects (age range, 50 to 75 years) provided stool specimens on cards from three consecutive days for fecal occult-blood testing, which were rehydrated for interpretation. They then underwent colonoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy was defined in this study as examination of the rectum and sigmoid colon during colonoscopy, and sensitivity was estimated by determining how many patients with advanced neoplasia had an adenoma in the rectum or sigmoid colon. Advanced colonic neoplasia was defined as an adenoma 10 mm or more in diameter, a villous adenoma, an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or invasive cancer. Classification of subjects according to the findings was based on the most advanced lesion.

Results

A total of 2885 subjects returned the three specimen cards for fecal occult-blood testing and underwent a complete colonoscopic examination. A total of 23.9 percent of subjects with advanced neoplasia had a positive test for fecal occult blood. As compared with subjects who had a negative test for fecal occult blood, the relative risk of advanced neoplasia in subjects who had a positive test was 3.47 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.76 to 4.35). Sigmoidoscopy identified 70.3 percent of all subjects with advanced neoplasia. Combined one-time screening with a fecal occult-blood test and sigmoidoscopy identified 75.8 percent of subjects with advanced neoplasia.

Conclusions

One-time screening with both a fecal occult-blood test with rehydration and sigmoidoscopy fails to detect advanced colonic neoplasia in 24 percent of subjects with the condition.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^02b568e9]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) performance and regulatory context — FITs consistently demonstrate superior sensitivity for cancer and advanced neoplasia and slightly lower specificity compared with low-sensitivity gFOBT, and compared with HSgFOBT the sensitivity and specificity of FIT tend to be similar or superior; for single-sample FIT, sensitivity ranges from 73% to 92% and specificity ranges from 91% to 97%, whereas HSgFOBT sensitivity ranges from 62% to 79% with specificity from 87% to 96%. Evidence across FIT brands is limited, with published colonoscopy-confirmed performance data for only 6 of the 26 FIT versions sold in the United States; at the time of publication the only guaiac test shown to meet high-sensitivity performance standards in a population-based study is Hemoccult II Sensa (Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA). Operationally, FIT positivity is generally not influenced by upper gastrointestinal bleeding and FITs eliminate the need for the dietary restrictions recommended with gFOBT. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance process does not require manufacturers to provide test sensitivity or specificity for CRC or adenomatous polyps, and tests are cleared only for detection of occult blood, not for CRC screening.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for colorectal cancer screening 2009 [^4f86e6ae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

This document is the first update of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations since 2000. The CRC screening tests are now grouped into cancer prevention tests and cancer detection tests. Colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 50, remains the preferred CRC screening strategy. It is recognized that colonoscopy is not available in every clinical setting because of economic limitations. It is also realized that not all eligible persons are willing to undergo colonoscopy for screening purposes. In these cases, patients should be offered an alternative CRC prevention test (flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, or a computed tomography (CT) colonography every 5 years) or a cancer detection test (fecal immunochemical test for blood, FIT).

### Colon cancer: detection and prevention [^bc832c74]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Recent data have advanced our ability to detect, survey, and manage patients with colonic neoplasia. Current studies and consensus statements increasingly support the role of colonoscopic screening over less invasive testing such as FOBT or FS for appropriately selected individuals. There are many issues, however, that remain unresolved. What is the appropriate surveillance of an individual with a single family member who had colon cancer at an early age? How should family members of suspected HNPCC kindreds be managed? There has yet to be a prospective cohort validation of the Bethesda criteria in directing clinical practice, with the endpoint of mortality reduction. Questions regarding prophylaxis with dietary supplements and medications are exciting areas that are currently under study. As newer technologies become clinically available for molecular diagnostics and screening, and virtual colonoscopy with computed tomography and magnetic resonance disseminates, there will undoubtedly be new questions to be answered regarding their ability to aid in the detection and management of colon cancer.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force colorectal cancer screening — first-tier tests and overall approach: Colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are identified as first-tier tests, and "Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as the cornerstones of screening." In a sequential strategy with colonoscopy offered first, "FIT should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy." When presenting multiple options, "Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as tests of choice," and a "risk-stratified approach is also appropriate," using FIT where advanced neoplasia prevalence is low and colonoscopy where prevalence is high.

### Does stool collection method affect outcomes in immunochemical fecal occult blood testing? [^119a6de7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

This paper compares the positive predictive value of an immunochemical fecal occult blood test for colorectal neoplasms between the stool specimens obtained during the digital rectal examination and those obtained during the routine screening.

Methods

In a medical check-up, 1,688 subjects received both an immunochemical fecal occult blood test and a colonoscopy. Fecal occult blood was tested by two methods: digital rectal examination and routine screening. The positivity rate of an immunochemical fecal occult blood test and the positive predictive value for colorectal cancer and large adenomatous polyp were determined by these two methods.

Results

The positivity rate and the positive predictive value were 5.4 percent and 19.8 percent (4.4 percent for cancer and 15.4 percent for adenomatous polyp) in the digital rectal examination method and 3.5 percent and 27.1 percent (6.8 percent for cancer and 20.3 percent for adenomatous polyp) in the routine screening method, respectively. These figures indicate a significant difference in the positivity rate (P < 0.01) and the positive predictive value (P < 0.05) between these two methods.

Conclusions

These findings indicate that the stool obtained by routine screening has a better positive predictive value than stool collected during the digital rectal examination.

### Screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians (version 2) [^5dfa61f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer screening — fecal immunochemical test (FIT) accuracy and effectiveness indicate that commonly used FIT had a sensitivity of 0.74 (CI, 0.64 to 0.83) and a specificity of 0.94 (CI, 0.93 to 0.96), and the modeling study used a sensitivity of 0.74 and a slightly higher specificity of 0.97; one nonrandomized study found that screening with biennial FIT was associated with lower CRC mortality versus no screening (adjusted RR, 0.90 [CI, 0.84 to 0.95]); FIT is noninvasive with no known serious harms, though harms occur with colonoscopy after an abnormal FIT result.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^b4852c51]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fecal immunochemical test in patients at increased risk for colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^7930b9ee]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The potential role of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for screening patients at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been elucidated.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of FIT for CRC or advanced neoplasia (AN) in asymptomatic patients at above-average risk.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and gray literature sources through August 2016.

Study Selection

Diagnostic studies evaluating the accuracy of FIT for CRC or AN in patients with a personal or familial history of CRC using colonoscopy as the reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors (A.K. and P.P.) independently extracted data and evaluated study quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, and evaluated the quality of the body of evidence by means of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Hierarchical models were used to synthesize available evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of FIT for detecting CRC or AN.

Results

We included 12 studies (6204 participants). Seven studies were deemed at high or unclear risk of bias. The average sensitivity of FIT for CRC was 93% (95% CI, 53%-99%), and the average specificity was 91% (95% CI, 89%-92%), yielding a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 10.30 (CI 7.7–13.9) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.01–0.75) (GRADE: very low). The average sensitivity of FIT for AN was 48% (95% CI, 39%-57%); and the average specificity was 93% (95% CI, 91%-94%), yielding an LR+ of 6.55 (95% CI, 5.0–8.5) and an LR- of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.48–0.67) (GRADE: very low). Subgroup analyses indicated that FIT cutoff values between 15- and 25-μg/g feces provided the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CRC (93% and 94%, respectively). Quantitative and 1-sample FIT showed adequate test performance, but data on other FIT brands and multiple samples were insufficient.

Conclusions and Relevance

The FIT has high overall diagnostic accuracy for CRC but moderate accuracy for AN in patients at above-average personal or familial risk. Heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals limit the trustworthiness of our findings.

### Do aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause false-positive fecal occult blood test results? A prospective study in a cohort of veterans [^00a27fec]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether use of regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a risk factor for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result.

Methods

Consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test result at a Veterans Affairs hospital were eligible. Patients with hematochezia, peptic ulcer disease, or unevaluated dyspepsia requiring antacids, or who used warfarin, were excluded. Regular aspirin and NSAID use was defined as at least one daily dose for at least 3 days per week. Colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result alone were defined a priori as diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or polyps < 1.0 cm with no villous histology. Findings likely to explain a positive test result included cancer and advanced polyps.

Results

The sample comprised 193 veterans with a mean (± SD) age of 66 ± 10 years; 98% were male and 86% were white. No colonoscopic findings explained the positive fecal occult blood test result in 153 patients (79%). One hundred and thirty-five patients (70%) were regular aspirin or NSAID users, of whom 21% (n = 29) had findings to explain the positive test results, compared with 19% (11/58) of nonusers (P = 0.7). There was no relation between aspirin dose and colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result. Multivariate analysis found no association between regular aspirin or NSAID use and a false-positive test result (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 1.84).

Conclusion

Aspirin and NSAID use were not risk factors for a false-positive fecal occult blood test result in this study.

### Reducing the burden of colorectal cancer: AGA position statements [^7c4d8b30]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA position statement — evidence that increasing screening reduces CRC burden: There is strong evidence from randomized controlled trials, observational clinical studies, and modeling studies that increasing CRC screening rates will reduce CRC incidence and mortality; randomized controlled trials with fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrated reduced CRC incidence and mortality with screening compared with no screening; observational studies show greater reductions with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) compared with guaiac FOBT and with colonoscopy compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy; validated models indicate profound impact in individuals 50 years and older and show benefits of extending screening to individuals aged 45–49 years; mean results of 4 well-established models suggest colonoscopy or FIT starting at age 45 years can avert approximately 75% and 61% of CRC.
