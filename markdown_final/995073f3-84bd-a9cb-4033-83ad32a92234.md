## Question

Are they still recommended if the GFR is 20?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SGLT2 inhibitors are still recommended when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 20 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact eGFR threshold for initiation versus continuation. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline consensus. Next, I will check for any exceptions, such as type 1 diabetes or dialysis. After that, I need to consider safety, monitoring, and what to do if eGFR declines further. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation with practical next steps.

> Let me first confirm the threshold language. KDIGO 2024 recommends initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with CKD when eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73 m², and importantly, it is reasonable to continue therapy even if eGFR subsequently falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless therapy is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is initiated, which directly addresses the "still recommended" question for eGFR around 20 [^1165ykcs] [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and consensus. KDIGO gives a Grade 1A recommendation for initiation at eGFR ≥ 20 in type 2 diabetes with CKD and for several non-diabetic CKD scenarios, and a Grade 2B suggestion for eGFR 20–45 with lower albuminuria, reflecting high-certainty benefits and broad alignment across major guidelines, including ADA 2025 and UK Kidney Association 2023, which similarly endorse initiation at eGFR ≥ 20 and continuation below that threshold when tolerated [^1165ykcs] [^116ZzRpS] [^112twXGq].

> Hold on, I should verify the trial basis that underpins this. Large CKD trials such as EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD enrolled participants down to eGFR 20 and 25, respectively, and showed robust reductions in kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events; meta-analyses demonstrate approximately a 37% reduction in kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in AKI irrespective of diabetes, supporting both initiation at eGFR 20 and continuation below that level in many patients [^113dFj4k] [^116Cayz4] [^113dFj4k].

> I need to ensure I address exceptions. SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended for type 1 diabetes due to euglycemic ketoacidosis risk, and in patients on dialysis or with very advanced kidney failure, evidence is limited and many guidelines advise against initiation; however, some contemporary guidance allows consideration even below eGFR 20 in select cases, but that remains a nuanced, individualized decision rather than a blanket recommendation [^114s3Xtf] [^112twXGq] [^112jjyMz].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. An initial reversible eGFR "dip" of about 10–30% is expected after initiation; a drop exceeding 30% should prompt evaluation but is not itself an indication to stop, and routine extra lab monitoring solely due to SGLT2 initiation is not required. I should double-check that this aligns with KDIGO's hemodynamically active therapy guidance, which it does [^116AyvdY] [^116AyvdY] [^11373Ayt].

> Let me consider practical steps. If eGFR is 20, I should confirm the diagnosis of CKD, assess albuminuria, volume status, and concomitant medications, then initiate a standard dose of an SGLT2 inhibitor such as empagliflozin 10 mg daily or dapagliflozin 10 mg daily, counsel on genital infections and sick-day rules, and plan to recheck kidney function and electrolytes in about 4–12 weeks to ensure the expected eGFR dip is within 10–30% and that potassium remains stable, continuing therapy unless adverse effects or KRT emerge [^1165ykcs] [^116hMxBK] [^11373Ayt].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on an SGLT2 inhibitor and eGFR drifts to 20? I should confirm that continuation is still reasonable unless not tolerated or KRT is initiated, and I should avoid stopping for a modest eGFR decline; if the patient becomes volume depleted or faces prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness, I should temporarily hold the drug to mitigate ketoacidosis risk and then resume when safe [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo] [^114s3Xtf].

> In summary, yes — SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended at eGFR 20 for initiation in appropriate patients with CKD, and if already on therapy, they should generally be continued even if eGFR falls below 20, provided they are tolerated and KRT has not begun, with shared decision-making and routine safety monitoring rather than reflex discontinuation [^1165ykcs] [^1152W5vk] [^113NtASN].

SGLT2 inhibitors are **recommended to initiate at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^1165ykcs] for patients with CKD, including those with type 2 diabetes, because they reduce kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events [^116Cayz4] [^113dFj4k]. If eGFR later falls below 20, **continuation is reasonable unless therapy is not tolerated or dialysis is initiated** [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo]. For eGFR < 20, initiation is not routinely recommended, but some guidelines suggest it may be considered case-by-case, especially if albuminuria is high or heart failure is present [^112twXGq] [^112jjyMz]. Always monitor for volume depletion, hyperkalemia, and ketoacidosis, and adjust other medications as needed [^114s3Xtf] [^116AyvdY].

## Current guideline recommendations

### KDIGO 2024 guidelines

- **Initiation**: Initiate SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with CKD and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², including those with type 2 diabetes, to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events [^1165ykcs] [^116YTNGo].

- **Continuation**: Continue SGLT2 inhibitors even if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless not tolerated or dialysis is initiated [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo].

- **Low albuminuria**: Consider SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with eGFR 20–45 mL/min/1.73 m² and urine ACR < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) [^116fYV79] [^116L3tgj].

---

### ADA 2025 guidelines

ADA 2025 recommends **SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^113NtASN] [^1113Xymz]. Continuation is advised until dialysis or transplant, even if eGFR declines below 20 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116ZzRpS].

---

### UK Kidney Association 2023 guidelines

The UK Kidney Association recommends **initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²**, especially with albuminuria or heart failure [^116Zy5YB] [^113VRRaN]. Consider initiation even when eGFR is < 20 mL/min/1.73 m² in select cases [^112twXGq] [^112jjyMz].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use at low eGFR

- **EMPA-KIDNEY**: Benefits on kidney outcomes were consistent down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m², including in patients without diabetes [^113dFj4k] [^116Sgpm4].

- **DAPA-CKD**: Benefits were observed in patients with eGFR as low as 25 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1158cmfL].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent reductions in kidney failure, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization across eGFR strata, including eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116Cayz4] [^11373VoP].

---

## Safety considerations at low eGFR

- **Initial eGFR dip**: Expect a reversible 10–30% eGFR decline after initiation; monitor but do not stop unless > 30% or symptomatic [^116BVZUa] [^1134hRPd].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Risk is low; monitor potassium, especially with ACEi/ARB or MRAs [^116L3tgj].

- **Ketoacidosis**: Rare but possible; assess risk, counsel, and hold during prolonged fasting, surgery, or acute illness [^114s3Xtf] [^116YTNGo].

- **Volume depletion**: Monitor and adjust diuretics as needed [^114s3Xtf].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² | Initiate SGLT2 inhibitor if indicated [^1165ykcs] [^113NtASN] |
| eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m² | - Not routinely initiated <br/> - Consider case-by-case if high albuminuria or heart failure [^112twXGq] [^112jjyMz] |
| Already on SGLT2 inhibitor, eGFR declines to 20 | Continue unless not tolerated or dialysis initiated [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo] |
| Monitoring | - Check eGFR and electrolytes 1–2 weeks after initiation <br/> - Then per routine CKD care [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical takeaways

- **Initiation**: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended to initiate at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for CKD, including T2DM, to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events [^1165ykcs] [^113NtASN].

- **Continuation**: Continue even if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless not tolerated or dialysis is initiated [^1152W5vk] [^116YTNGo].

- **eGFR < 20**: Initiation is not routine; consider case-by-case in high-risk patients [^112twXGq] [^112jjyMz].

- **Safety**: Monitor for volume depletion, hyperkalemia, and ketoacidosis; adjust concomitant medications as needed [^114s3Xtf] [^116BVZUa].

In sum, **eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² is the key threshold for initiation**, with continuation below 20 if tolerated, and selective consideration below 20 in high-risk patients.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)

CKD is a well-known risk for cardiovascular disease and CVD mortality. It has been recognized by both nephrology and cardiovascular organizations as one of the highest risk factors for the development of CVD. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial showed that the addition of simvastatin 20 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg for CVD primary prevention significantly reduced major atherosclerotic events in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD age 40 or greater by nearly 22%. The results of the SHARP trial have been further supported by multiple meta-analyses suggesting that patients with CKD derive statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment. CVD risk attenuation of statins is the result of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), rather than a class-dependent effect. Guidelines vary in their lipid-pharmacotherapy recommendation. KDIGO and KDOQI agree that statins should be initiated in all patients aged 50 years and older with CKD, in addition to patients younger than 50 years with > 10% cardiovascular event 10-year risk. The AHA/ACC acknowledges CKD as a significant risk factor for CVD, but ultimately recommend utilizing statins for target LDL-c reduction of > 50% for high-risk patients (> 20% ASCVD risk) and 30–49% for intermediate risk (7.5–20% ASCVD risk). ESC/EAS guidelines are more aggressive and recommend LDL-c targets of < 70 mg/dL (1.8mmol/L) for patients with GFR 30–59, and < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for patients with GFR < 30. Given recent trends in CVD, a new risk score titled PREVENT has been published by the AHA that incorporates kidney disease to more accurately predict 10- and 30- year risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

Context for recommendations

These recommendations apply to all adults with type 2 diabetes, regardless of ethnicity, sex, gender or comorbidities; and to adults with or without concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). These guidelines do not apply to individuals receiving kidney replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant, those with polycystic kidney disease, those with rare kidney diseases, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below the threshold for safe use of a candidate medication (medication-specific but typically < 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) and not receiving kidney replacement therapy. The recommendations focus exclusively on available medications for diabetes management; non-pharmacological interventions are outside the scope of the guideline.

Assessing a patient's risk

Benefits and harms of medications are likely to vary considerably according to an individual's baseline risk of cardiovascular and kidney complications without additional treatment. In general, the higher the baseline risk for a given cardiovascular or kidney complication, the greater the benefit of treatment with a disease-modifying agent. Recommendations provided are therefore stratified by the risk of such complications, classifying individuals as being at either lower, moderate or higher risk based on the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or of established CVD or CKD. In the absence of credible baseline risk estimates for other prioritised outcomes, risk stratification is currently limited to five patient-important outcomes (all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation for heart failure, and kidney failure). The three defined risk strata represent a simple and pragmatic representation of the gradient of risk encompassed across patients with type 2 diabetes, and facilitate risk-stratified recommendations. They are designed to be practically helpful for clinical decision makers. However, the quality of evidence to support the defined risk categories and associated baseline risks across prioritised outcomes is variable (see methods and Summary of Findings tables in MAGICapp for full details).

### Recommended methods of drug dosing adjustment for patients with renal impairment [^114Axnzd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Since 2020, there have been changes in Food and Drug Administration guidance and in recommendations by national organizations with a focus on kidney diseases pertaining to the choice of equations used to estimate creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. This includes a recommendation by the National Kidney Foundation to avoid the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment. This commentary provides an overview of recent recommendations concerning kidney function assessment that have important implications for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment and provides suggestions for implementing these recommendations.

### Assessment of glomerular filtration rate in health and disease: a state of the art review [^116bxUfb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic kidney diseases affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. There has been substantial progress in the past 20 years in the use of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations. In principle, use of a single equation for each filtration marker (creatinine, cystatin C, or the combination) for detection, evaluation, and management of kidney disease and for drug development and dosing would facilitate clinical practice. We review the principles for assessment of GFR, provide historical perspectives and updates regarding use of GFR estimating equations, including assay methods for filtration markers, performance of estimating equations, and recommendations by clinical practice guideline groups and regulatory agencies. We conclude that it is time to change from rigid adherence to the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation for use in drug development and drug dosing to the more accurate and more widely used Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations.

Conclusions

The chosen literature references resulted in bigger differences in recommendations for drug dose adjustment than the different equations used for estimating eGFR alone. Both, the divergent results of the eGFR equations and the conflicting instructions according to the literature sources can lead to uncertainty for the practitioner and as a result compromise patient safety. Thus there is a strong need for a validated eGFR-equation for estimating kidney function in the elderly. Further research on estimation of GFR and the development of an international consensus on concordant recommendations for practitioners concerning drug dose adjustment in renal failure are desirable.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with reduced eGFR and low albuminuria — Recommendation 3.7.3 states "We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² with urine ACR < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B)". Rationale notes that "Large trials individually and when combined in meta-analysis demonstrate clear net benefits of SGLT2i, with benefits particularly large in people without diabetes due to almost no risk of serious harm from ketoacidosis or lower-limb amputation", and that "SGLT2i reduced the risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes (Figure 22)". Additional effects include that "SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, fluid overload, and the risk of serious hyperkalemia". For patients with concomitant heart failure, "a person with CKD and heart failure has a clear indication for the use of SGLT2i to reduce risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure irrespective of level of albuminuria". Evidence certainty statements indicate "The overall certainty of evidence for the efficacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with CKD without diabetes is moderate", supported by an IPD meta-analysis "which included data from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor among adults with CKD but not diabetes", where "Both RCTs were considered to have a low risk of bias". Certainty gradings specify "The certainty of the evidence for CKD progression was graded as high" and "The certainty of the evidence for kidney failure was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision".

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1165ykcs]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for CKD — We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with an SGLT2i (1A). We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine ACR ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol), or heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine ACR < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). Practice points add that once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated; it is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness; and SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^1152ER3S]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Values, preferences, costs, and implementation for SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD without diabetes states that fully informed adults without diabetes and low levels of albuminuria (urine ACR < 200 mg/g [< 20 mg/mmol]) who have established CKD and an eGFR of 20–45 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 may be particularly motivated to take SGLT2i, Adults with established CKD are highly likely to want to start treatment early to maximize benefits, and extrapolation of the findings from eGFR slope analyses could show substantial delays in the need for KRT; health economic analyses are required to establish cost-effectiveness, reducing the cost burden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable, and the considerations for implementation are no different to people with albuminuria.

KDIGO 2024 — SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease: Two large randomized controlled trials using 2 different SGLT2i recruited 19,019 participants, and in a collaborative metaanalysis including those 2 and 11 other trials (13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized participants) in comparison with placebo, those allocated to an SGLT2i experienced a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) irrespective of diabetes status. These benefits appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of kidney disease, or level of GFR.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitor use — initiation, continuation, and trial enrollment: The guideline specifies a lower limit eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor, but maintains that it is safe to continue until reaching the need for KRT. DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

### Principles of kidney pharmacotherapy for the nephrologist: core curriculum 2021 [^112Rt2jr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Medications are an important part of the management of patients with kidney disease. When used appropriately, pharmacotherapy can slow disease progression and reduce morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, reduced kidney function can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many medications, putting patients at risk for drug toxicity if modifications to therapy are not appropriately managed. Adding complexity to the appropriateness of medication and dosage selection is the difficulty in estimating kidney function and the discordance between the Cockcroft-Gault-derived dosing cut points in most medication package inserts and the estimations of glomerular filtration rate by newer and generally more accurate guideline-recommended equations. This installment of the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology provides recent updates and practical considerations for designing optimal medication regimens. Given the prevalence of abnormal kidney function and its importance in medication selection and dose adjustment, additional focus and specific recommendations are provided for anticoagulant, anti-infective, analgesic, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive agents.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hemodynamically active therapies and eGFR change: Practice Point 2.1.4 states that among people with chronic kidney disease who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, "GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation". Acute eGFR decline after intensive blood pressure control shows "reductions of 10%–20% being typical within the first 3 months of treatment", and "acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents". Trials of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) suggest participants with " > 10% initial drop in eGFR" have similar outcomes "except in unusual cases when the acute "dip" in eGFR was > 30% from baseline". A "significant drop in eGFR (> 30%)" during initiation of antihypertensives, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or SGLT2i "should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring", and providers "should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents" because early dips are "typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity".

Because GFR estimating equations have been developed in units of mL/min per 1.73 m2 and drug clearance is more strongly associated with nonindexed eGFR (mL/min) than indexed eGFR (mL/min per 1.73 m2), in very small or large individuals this can result in over- or underdosing; nonindexed eGFR can be obtained by multiplying the indexed eGFR results by the person's BSA and dividing by 1.73 m2, or by using an appropriate online calculator.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114s3Xtf]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease primary care — SGLT2 inhibitor safety, perioperative management, and eGFR thresholds: SGLT2i treatment is contraindicated for type 1 diabetes, and caution should be taken when titrating down insulin doses in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin at initiation of SGLT2i therapy due to risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Multiple perioperative guidelines suggest holding SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness and reinitiating after an acute event has passed. With SGLT2i initiation, there is an expected, reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other guideline development groups have deemed this reversible decrease safe enough to recommend not reassessing eGFR following the initiation of SGLT2i therapy. In the evidence review, the lowest eGFR for initiation was 20 mL/min/1.73m2. Most studies did not specify discontinuation thresholds; two specified discontinuation when eGFR was < 15mL/min/1.73m2, and one specified discontinuation at the start of hemodialysis. There appeared to be continued efficacy until initiation of dialysis, and the Work Group suggests continuation of SGLT2i treatment until patients are started on dialysis. Work Group members raised concerns that SGLT2i may potentiate volume depletion with loop diuretics; additional monitoring might be indicated and, depending on volume status, a decrease in diuretics at initiation might be warranted.

Defining CKD progression

Classically, rapid CKD progression has been defined as a loss of > 5 mL/min/year. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline avoids defining any thresholds, arguing that any worsening could reflect deteriorating kidney health. Instead, advice is provided to better appreciate the intraindividual random biological variation in eGFR and albuminuria: a change in eGFR of > 20% or a doubling of uACR on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. While this definition focuses more broadly on how to interpret the changes in kidney function during patient monitoring, we may miss the denominator of time. Without considering the time between both subsequent tests, we do not have an impression on the speed of this decline.

The initiation of haemodynamically active therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA), GLP-1ra and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) results in transient short-term 'dips' in eGFR of a magnitude of 10%–30%. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommends review of underlying causes and close monitoring in patients with eGFR reductions of > 30% during the first 3 months of therapy with these agents. However, providers should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents, particularly since these earlier 'dips' are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity, especially as the potential clinical benefits are considerable.

### Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate: current status and future directions [^117PWaEL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the assessment of kidney function in medical practice, research and public health. Measured GFR (mGFR) remains the reference standard, but the past 20 years have seen major advances in estimated GFR (eGFR). Both eGFR and mGFR are associated with error compared with true GFR. eGFR is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines, regulatory agencies and public health agencies for the initial evaluation of GFR, with measured GFR (mGFR) typically considered an important confirmatory test, depending on how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for application to the clinical, research or public health setting. Our approach is to use initial and confirmatory tests as needed to develop a final assessment of true GFR. We suggest that GFR evaluation might be improved by more complete implementation of current recommendations and by further research to improve the accuracy of mGFR and eGFR.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^113Xv2tf]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Meta-analysis of large randomised clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibition indicates that cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition, particularly reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, are present irrespective of trial-level average eGFR. The benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition in terms of reducing progression of kidney disease are also not modified by eGFR in individual trials. eGFR slope analyses from heart failure and CKD trials consistently demonstrate reduced rates of kidney function decline among people treated with SGLT-2 inhibition, including those without significant albuminuria, as demonstrated in EMPA-KIDNEY (Fig. 3). EMPEROR-REDUCED, EMPEROR-PRESERVED, DAPA-HF and DELIVER all show reductions in the rate of kidney function decline with SGLT-2 inhibition compared to placebo, while in EMPEROR-REDUCED this reduction in rate of eGFR decline is present in the presence and absence of CKD and across the spectrum of albuminuria. Therefore, while this population has not been directly studied in randomised trials, there is indirect evidence to support reduction in cardiovascular risk and reduced rate of kidney function decline in this group, for which we provide a grade 2B Recommendation.
3 We suggest clinicians consider initiating SGLT-2 inhibition in people with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 to slow progression of kidney disease (Grade 2B)

Rationale

Clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibition conducted in populations with CKD have continued SGLT-2 inhibition until the initiation of kidney replacement therapy, providing indirect evidence to support the use of this SGLT-2 inhibition in this population. Furthermore, data from EMPA-KIDNEY indicates that the benefit of SGLT-2 inhibition in terms of progression of kidney disease is not attenuated in people with an eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 (Fig. 4). There is no suggestion from the data that kidney benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition begin to attenuate down to an eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73m 2, and those with very low eGFR are at particularly high risk (Fig. 4). We therefore provide a 2B Recommendation for use in people with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2.

### Integrating international consensus guidelines for anticancer drug dosing in kidney dysfunction (ADDIKD) into everyday practice [^114sZbcG]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Comparison of ADDIKD's recommendations vs existing guidance for methotrexate dosing according to kidney function.

As shown in Table 1, ADDIKD's guidance distinguishes high-from low-dose methotrexate and curative from non-curative treatment intent (see Supplementary Material 2 for ADDIKD's complete methotrexate dosing recommendations). Unlike other guidance, when prescribing high-dose methotrexate, ADDIKD strongly recommends the utilisation of directly measured glomerular filtration rate (through direct measurement of the clearance of exogenous markers such as iohexol, iothalamate, 51 Cr-EDTA or 99m Tc-DTPA and expressed in mL/min), at baseline rather than an estimated assessment (i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], CrCl). By way of a specific example, overall survival of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) relies on high-dose methotrexate to penetrate the blood–brain-barrier. Existing guidelines empirically halve the dose of methotrexate when CrCl or GFR is 20–50 mL/min, whereas ADDIKD enables tailoring of the extent of dose reduction, by considering treatment intent and/or additional patient factors into more discrete bands according to the KDIGO Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) categories of kidney function. Being curative, high-dose methotrexate in PCNSL patients (with a good performance status) who have an eGFR between 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (or directly measured GFR between 45–59 mL/min) should maintain full doses, thereby ensuring dose exposure without significantly increasing toxicity. ADDIKD recommends a 25% dose reduction or using an alternative protocol in patients not receiving curative treatment and/or poorer performance status. For example, if considering the use of low-dose methotrexate protocols, such as for breast cancer, alternative regimens without methotrexate demonstrate similar survival outcomes and do not increase the risk haematological and kidney-related adverse events.

In addition to the specific dosing adjustments shown in Table 1, ADDIKD includes a set of 'practice points' to guide the administration of methotrexate (see Fig. 1).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) in CKD — benefits, harms, and monitoring: In randomized trials, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have consistently shown renal and cardiovascular benefits in proteinuric kidney disease, and they remain nephroprotective in those with GFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Adverse effects include acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, hypotension, angioedema, cough, headache, and nausea, and they are associated with teratogenicity. KDIGO guidelines recommend that the initial dose should be lower for individuals with GFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, with GFR and potassium measured within 1 week of starting, or after any dose escalation, and regularly thereafter. ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be temporarily discontinued during intercurrent illness, planned intravenous radiocontrast administration, bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy, or before major surgery, and contraindications include a history of allergy or angioedema and bilateral renal artery stenosis.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^116Sgpm4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to be effective in people with albuminuric chronic kidney disease across broad population, including people with and without type 2 diabetes, and down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73m 2. Meta-analysis of CKD trials and all SGLT-2 inhibitor trials demonstrates that the kidney benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition are not modified by the presence or absence of diabetes. Furthermore, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY both indicate consistent benefits irrespective of primary kidney disease, with benefits observed in glomerular disease of a similar magnitude to those seen in diabetic kidney disease.

SGLT-2 inhibition has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalisation in people with stable established symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-REDUCED trials, with relative effects similar in people with and without DM. Data from EMPEROR-PRESERVED and DELIVER confirm benefits on heart failure complications in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), including people without DM. The four large trials recruited a substantial proportion of people with CKD, with cardiac benefits appearing to be unmodified by moderately reduced levels of eGFR. We therefore provide a grade 1A Recommendation for use of SGLT-2 inhibition in people without DM with an eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 and uACR ≥ 25 mg/mmol, or those with symptomatic heart failure. Note that the 25 mg/mmol threshold for uACR was chosen pragmatically, given that this value is expected to be easier to recall for practicing clinicians than a cut-off of 23 mg/mmol, as is commonly used in the CKD trials.
2 We recommend initiating SGLT-2 inhibition to slow rate of kidney function decline in people with an eGFR of 20–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a uACR of < 25 mg/mmol* (Grade 1B)

* urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 35 mg/mmol can be considered equivalent.

SGLT2 inhibitors and dialysis

Many health organizations recommend discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with severe renal impairment; however, clinical trials have been conducted in patients receiving dialysis. The recommendation is to consider SGLT2is in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hospitalized heart failure patients if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 20 ml/min/1.73 m². There are no contraindications for low-dose use: the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin should not exceed 10 mg/day, and canagliflozin should not exceed 25 mg/day. Recent guidelines do not advocate initiating SGLT2is in patients receiving dialysis with heart failure and recommend discontinuation if the patient is off dialysis.

A recent trial involving 125 patients with eGFRs below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and stage 5 dialysis (G5D) demonstrated the effectiveness of dapagliflozin and the non-adenosine nature of the treatment. The data provide solid evidence supporting the use of SGLT2is in patients on dialysis. Three phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating SGLT2is, aimed at understanding their impact on kidney survival, cardiovascular events, and mortality, were reviewed to assess benefits for patient management. The nephrology society has modified recommendations for patients with a GFR below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² regarding high doses of the tested SGLT2is. Multidisciplinary stewardship should be applied when using SGLT2is in G5D patients due to patient preferences, the presence of hyperkalemia, fluid restrictions, and comorbidities. Experts advise administering SGLT2is at least 2 h post-dialysis and adjusting doses based on weekly drug clearance.

Current Guidelines for SGLT2i Use in T2DM

While the NICE NG28 recommendations are used by the majority of UK HCPs to guide T2DM treatment decisions, there are some gaps in the current NICE guidelines that are considered in the ADA/EASD and KDIGO guidance. The NG28 guideline recommends initiation of SGLT2i therapy in combination with metformin (once metformin tolerability has been confirmed) for individuals with high CV risk, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), comorbid HF and comorbid CKD. SGLT2i monotherapy is also advocated for use in high-risk individuals with T2DM who are unable to tolerate metformin. NICE recommends the use of the QRISK2 ® tool (QRISK ® 3 is also available as an updated version to use online but is currently less widely integrated in primary care systems) to assess a person's risk of CVD. People with T2DM who are under the age of 40 years and therefore unsuitable for QRISK assessment should be considered at high risk if they have one or more CV risk factor, defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, obesity, and family history (in a first-degree relative) of premature CVD. According to ADA/EASD guidelines, SGLT2is may be used as a first-line treatment in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies (or alone) where the treatment goal is to achieve and maintain glycaemic and weight management targets, with early combination therapy endorsed to optimise outcomes and extend the time to therapeutic failure. Under the same guidelines, SGLT2is are the recommended first-line therapy (in addition to comprehensive CV risk-management strategies) when the goal of treatment is cardiorenal risk reduction in high-risk people with T2DM, comprising those with known cardiorenal disease (established CVD/HF/CKD) or indicators of high ASCVD risk. The Primary Care Diabetes Europe position statement recommends combining SGLT2i therapy with metformin for individuals with T2DM and HF or CKD, ensuring both glycaemic control and cardiorenal protection. The KDIGO 2022 recommendations include SGLT2is within their comprehensive care strategy to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression and CVD in people with diabetes. KDIGO supports combination therapy with metformin and an SGLT2i and advises that SGLT2is may be initiated when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥ 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and continued (as tolerated), until dialysis or transplantation is initiated. Likewise, the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) recommends SGLT2is for people with T2DM and eGFR ≥ 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2 attributed to diabetic nephropathy and in people with T2DM and coronary disease or stable symptomatic HF (irrespective of ejection fraction).

CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

The prescribing information for metformin in the current label is explicit with respect to renal contraindications, based on serum creatinine cut points. It proscribes use at or above the 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL levels in women and men, respectively. The recently updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation are perfectly consistent with the label. Yet, certain U.S. practice guidelines substantially differ in their recommendations for metformin use related to renal status. The annually updated clinical practice guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association, for example, do not actually discuss renal thresholds but refer the reader to a separate consensus statement for prescribing details. This statement, authored by members of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, reports that metformin seems safe unless eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

Clinical guidelines outside of the U.S. incorporate the eGFR for determination of metformin safety. In the U.K. for example, prescribing guidelines consider both creatinine and eGFR for assessing treatment eligibility. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends reviewing the clinical circumstances when serum creatinine exceeds 130 µmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or eGFR falls below 45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence further specifies that metformin be stopped if serum creatinine exceeds 150 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) (a higher threshold than in the U.S.) or eGFR is below 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. In contrast, the Canadian Diabetes Association practice guidelines are now based solely on eGFR, recommending caution with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and contraindicating its use with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. The Australian Diabetes Society practice guidelines similarly recommend against metformin with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and caution with eGFR 30–45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Thus, although there is clear recognition that renal failure may be a risk factor for adverse events with metformin use, there is significant divergence in opinion across the globe regarding the optimal definition of safety.

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^115FpGnT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^11373Ayt]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitor implementation in adults with chronic kidney disease — the Work Group considered it safe to continue or even initiate an SGLT2i when the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and to continue use until kidney replacement therapy is initiated. The group also considered that initiating SGLT2i does not necessitate alteration of frequency of laboratory monitoring, and it is not routinely necessary to recheck blood tests after initiating an SGLT2i in adults with CKD. Reduced glomerular hyperfiltration from SGLT2i can result in a dip in eGFR which is reversible. None of the large trials demonstrated an increased risk of AKI in people treated with SGLT2i, and the intervention does not induce hyperkalemia. Adults with polycystic kidney disease were excluded from the large CKD trials testing SGLT2i.
