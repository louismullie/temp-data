can fetus considered alife

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a fetus can be considered alive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological definition of life and whether a fetus meets it. Then, I should distinguish that from the medical concept of viability and the legal definition of a live birth. Next, I will examine how different disciplines frame "being alive" versus "being a person". Finally, I will synthesize an ethically sensitive answer that acknowledges the distinctions between biological life, viability, and legal personhood, and I will double-check that my terminology aligns with current standards and guidelines > Let me first confirm the biological baseline. A fetus, by definition, is a developing human organism from about 9 weeks after fertilization through birth, exhibiting metabolism, growth, response to stimuli, and coordinated organ development, which squarely meets standard biological criteria for being alive as an organism, albeit one that is physiologically dependent on the pregnant person for oxygen, nutrients, and waste removal.

> Wait, let me verify the terminology trap here, because I initially almost equated "alive" with "viable". Hold on, I should verify the medical distinction. In obstetrics, "pregnancy viability" in the first trimester simply means a pregnancy with detectable cardiac activity and is not a statement about extrauterine survival, whereas "fetal viability" refers to the capacity to survive outside the uterus with available medical support, typically in the 22–24 week range in contemporary practice, and varies with individual factors and local resources, so early cardiac activity does not equal viability [^116jfg6C] [^114JkXSa] [^114k4mvE].

> I need to check the legal and public health definitions next. A live birth is defined by the presence of signs of life after separation from the mother — breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite voluntary muscle movement — and is recognized regardless of gestational age, which means a fetus can be biologically alive in utero yet not legally "alive" until it exhibits those signs after delivery, reinforcing that "alive" in law is tied to extrauterine signs of life rather than intrauterine existence per se [^113Pmo7H] [^112oeV9c].

> Let me consider the philosophical dimension carefully. Being biologically alive is not the same as being a moral or legal person; personhood typically requires capacities such as consciousness, sentience, or interests, and fetuses are generally described as having a dependent moral status that increases with gestational development and the pregnant person's intention to continue the pregnancy, but this does not grant independent rights that override maternal autonomy in medical ethics frameworks [^1126RUua] [^111qzKj1].

> I should double-check how guidelines advise clinicians to communicate this. Professional societies recommend avoiding ambiguous terms like "viable" or "alive" in early pregnancy and instead using precise language such as "cardiac activity present" or "10-week fetus with heartbeat", precisely to prevent conflating pregnancy viability with fetal viability and to respect the distinct biological, clinical, and legal meanings of "alive" in different contexts [^113TpvjF].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion is precise. Yes, a fetus is biologically alive from early gestation onward as a living human organism, but "being alive" in medical and legal discourse is context-dependent: it is not equivalent to viability, nor does it confer legal personhood or independent rights, and clinicians should explicitly distinguish biological life from viability and from legal live birth when counseling patients to avoid confusion and to honor both scientific accuracy and ethical nuance [^114JkXSa] [^113Pmo7H] [^1126RUua].

The fetus is **biologically alive** from conception, exhibiting metabolism, growth, and response to stimuli, but it is not considered a **separate legal person** until birth in most jurisdictions [^115ykFZG]. Viability — the ability to survive outside the uterus — typically begins around **24 weeks** of gestation, though this varies with medical resources and individual circumstances [^115FnETu] [^114JkXSa]. Ethical and legal views differ: some emphasize the fetus's potential personhood and rights, while others prioritize maternal autonomy and the fetus's dependence on the mother [^1126RUua] [^111qzKj1]. Thus, the fetus is biologically alive, but its legal and moral status is complex and context-dependent [^1126RUua] [^111qzKj1].

---

## Biological evidence of fetal life

Biologically, the fetus is **alive from conception**, exhibiting metabolism, growth, and response to stimuli. Key milestones include:

- **Implantation**: Around day 6–10 post-fertilization, the embryo implants and begins drawing maternal resources, a clear sign of ongoing metabolism and growth.

- **Cardiac activity**: Detectable by ultrasound around 5–6 weeks, indicating a functioning circulatory system.

- **Neural development**: Begins early, with brainstem activity by 10–12 weeks, enabling reflexive responses.

- **Movement**: Limb and trunk movements are observable by ultrasound from about 8–10 weeks, reflecting neuromuscular coordination.

These features confirm the fetus is a **living organism**, though it remains dependent on the mother for survival [^111AyDBV].

---

## Legal definitions and implications

Legally, the fetus is generally **not considered a person** until birth, though laws vary by jurisdiction:

- **United States**: The fetus is not a legal person under federal law; however, some states grant limited rights or protections, particularly after viability.

- **United Kingdom**: The fetus has no legal personality until birth, though the law recognizes offenses like child destruction after 24 weeks.

- **International**: Most countries align with the principle that legal personhood begins at birth, though some recognize limited fetal rights, especially post-viability.

These legal frameworks shape **abortion laws**, fetal homicide statutes, and medical decision-making [^115ykFZG].

---

## Ethical perspectives

Ethical views on fetal life are diverse and often **conflict**:

- **Pro-life stance**: Emphasizes the fetus's potential personhood and right to life from conception, viewing abortion as morally impermissible except in rare cases.

- **Pro-choice stance**: Prioritizes maternal autonomy and the fetus's dependence on the mother, supporting the right to abortion, particularly before viability.

- **Gradualist view**: Recognizes increasing moral status as the fetus develops, with greater ethical weight after viability.

These perspectives influence **public policy**, medical ethics, and individual decision-making [^117YBhQV].

---

## Medical definitions and clinical practice

Medically, the concept of **viability** is central. Viability is the gestational age at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus with medical support, typically around **24 weeks**, though survival at 22–23 weeks is possible in some settings. Before viability, the fetus is entirely dependent on the mother; after viability, medical intervention may sustain life, though outcomes vary widely [^113TpvjF] [^112Sa7WM] [^112VKUv1] [^112r6xm8] [^115FnETu].

---

## Societal and cultural influences

Cultural, religious, and societal values **significantly shape views** of fetal life. Ultrasound technology has increased public awareness and emotional connection to the fetus, influencing both individual and societal attitudes toward abortion and fetal rights [^116p46r6].

## Summary of perspectives

| **Perspective** | **View on fetal life** | **Implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Biological | Alive from conception | - Metabolism <br/> - Growth <br/> - Response to stimuli |
| Legal | Personhood at birth | Varies by jurisdiction; affects abortion laws and fetal rights |
| Ethical | - Diverse <br/> - Conflicting | Influences public policy and individual decisions |
| Medical | Viability around 24 weeks | Guides clinical practice and neonatal care |
| Societal | - Culturally shaped <br/> - Variable | Influences laws, policies, and individual attitudes |

The fetus is **biologically alive** from conception, but its legal and moral status is complex and varies by context. Viability marks a critical threshold, after which the fetus may survive outside the uterus, though it remains dependent on medical support.

### The limits of viability [^116aHcT1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Words and concepts based on those expressions matter. As clinicians, we must be consistent when discussing the concept of viability. It has been said that there is something about a crisis that gives us clarity. We are currently facing a crisis of demarcation for providing optimal options to patients. Our patients and society look to us for guidance. Clinicians, our patients, the courts, legislatures, and the general public need this clarity. With this call to action for individuals to evaluate their use of the term viable, there is opportunity for professional organizations to clarify this confusion as well. If we do not get this right, how can we expect individuals outside of the medical profession to understand what it means for a pregnancy or fetus to be viable?

### Recognising our' invisible infants': there is no internationally agreed definition of live birth-is this ethically acceptable? [^11187pzc]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Globally, there is a lack of adherence to the WHO definition of live birth. This is leading to untenable ethical inconsistencies due to significant variation in which infants are being acknowledged and registered as alive. If an infant is not registered as alive, there can be no acknowledgement of their rights as a child, and there are subsequent implications for worldwide child health resources and funding. Being alive should not be a quality that is geographically determined. This paper explores the differing definitions that are used regarding live birth and the ethical and practical implications for infants, their families and child health worldwide.

### The limits of viability [^116jfg6C]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Even though legal discourse has depended on medicine to define the concept of viability, it is arguable that medicine fails to clarify the confusion, though it is a term that has been used for nearly 200 years. Reference to viability in medical writing goes back at least to 1832, when William Potts Dewees in Compendius System of Midwifery defines viability as, "the capacity to sustain life, rather than the mere signs of this condition". In the PubMed archives, we find, in 1841, "Case of a Foetus: Viable at Six Months", which carries the prescient first sentence, "There is no question in medico-legal science more difficult, and none more interesting and important, than that of the exact limits of utero-gestation, that is, the longest and shortest periods which a child may be carried in the womb, and yet survive".

In current times, obstetricians use the terms viability or viable in two contexts:
At or around the time a fetus can survive outside of the uterus. This is often called fetal viability. A viable fetus is contrasted with a fetus that cannot survive outside of the pregnancy.
When an embryo or fetus has a detectable heartbeat. This is generally considered pregnancy viability. A viable pregnancy is contrasted with a failed pregnancy.

The subtle difference in those two usages suggests the importance of precision and specificity in this terminology. In one case — fetal viability — we describe a dependent organism that can possibly survive at that moment outside the pregnancy, though with the help of medical technology. In the other case — pregnancy viability — we describe a condition that has a possibility of producing a liveborn neonate, eventually. Unfortunately, we suspect that practitioners in these areas (obstetricians, midwives, and radiologists, for example) are rarely thinking of the difference between these two usages as they communicate with each other, patients and families, and society.

### The limits of viability [^114JkXSa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

What does it mean for a pregnancy or a fetus to be viable? This question has been passionately pursued in political, legal, religious, philosophical, and scientific conversations. The discussion is also occurring in a medical context, because this is one of our time's more critical health care questions. However, a lack of precision in health care professionals' use of the term "viable" has contributed to confusion and misinformation regarding pregnancy and has inflamed an already precarious sociopolitical relationship between government and women's reproductive health. The term viable appears to be used variably, imprecisely, and with controversy throughout these different conversations, even in medicine and particularly when courts and legislatures appropriate medical terminology. The possibilities for legislatures to misuse and confuse the terminology are even more perilous, particularly considering proposed "heartbeat bills". There is no uniform single line of viability that is medically appropriate to apply to all fetuses in all settings, and certainly not one based on gestational age alone. Terminology in medicine should aim to be free from controversial interpretation, which may not be the case for viability. Good medicine requires clear definitions, as evidenced by the need for medical dictionaries. Therefore, the question is better asked as, "Do we have a clear concept of how to use the term 'viable' in medicine and, specifically, obstetrics?"

As obstetricians, these questions have been on the authors' minds recently, and we hope to explore these questions with our colleagues. We should specify that we are not asking, "When does life begin?" We have our personal opinions on the answer to this question but do not purport to be professionals in philosophy, religion, cellular biology, or physiology. Instead, we wish to focus on the linguistic terminology and usage in medicine that confuses our colleagues, legislatures, judges, the public, and, most importantly, pregnant people and their families. As it stands, this confusion appears to lead one to ask the question "When does life begin?" even when it is not necessary. The unintended creep of the medical term viability into common parlance and usage has led to confusion, societal tension, and, most importantly, suboptimal care for birthing people.

### After-birth abortion: why should the baby live? [^113LyjgE]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Abortion is largely accepted even for reasons that do not have anything to do with the fetus' health. By showing that (1) both fetuses and newborns do not have the same moral status as actual persons, (2) the fact that both are potential persons is morally irrelevant and (3) adoption is not always in the best interest of actual people, the authors argue that what we call 'after-birth abortion' (killing a newborn) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^113sCVEr]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Accurately defining and reporting perinatal deaths (ie, fetal and infant deaths) is a critical first step in understanding the magnitude and causes of these important events. In addition to obstetric health care providers, neonatologists and pediatricians should know the current US definitions and reporting requirements for live births, fetal deaths, and infant deaths. Correct identification of these vital events will improve our local, state, and national data so that these deaths can be better addressed and reduced.

### Global policy and practice for intrauterine fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery for open spina bifida repair [^114k4mvE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Globally accepted evidence-based practice for fetal closure of open spina bifida recommends that a woman should be between 19 weeks and 25 weeks plus 6 days of pregnancy to be eligible for fetal surgery, with only a few centers performing surgery beyond this date and up to 31 weeks of gestation. A fetus requiring emergency delivery during surgery is therefore considered viable and thus eligible for resuscitation; however, clinical practice is apparently geographically dependent and may vary according to legal definitions in the relevant country. In the UK and US, guidelines recommend that active resuscitation is considered from 22 weeks of gestation if the neonate displays signs of life. There is wide variation across Europe, and prior to 26 weeks of gestation, treatment may be active, minimal interventions only, palliative, or requiring parental consent. It is unclear whether neonatal resuscitation guidelines in each country apply to infants with a serious congenital anomaly, who, in addition, experience serious fetal distress and eventually are delivered alive after a decision by the clinical team to expedite delivery during fetal surgery. It is also unknown how this scenario is addressed by parents who travel across country borders for fetal surgery. This study therefore aims to assess current policy and practice for both fetal resuscitation during fetal surgery and neonatal resuscitation after emergency delivery during fetal surgery, in fetal centers undertaking this surgery across the world.

### Do the 'brain dead' merely appear to be alive? [^115Uv916]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Some patients meeting diagnostic tests for 'brain death' can be supported for very long periods of time, perhaps indefinitely. It is impossible to know how many could be supported in this way since, once the declaration of 'brain death' is made, the patient will almost certainly either have life-sustaining treatment removed or will be an organ donor. However, there are at least 30 known cases of pregnant women having been physiologically supported for up to 107 days to gestate a fetus; a young boy meeting 'brain death' criteria was physiologically supported for 20 years; and more recently, a young woman has been maintained on home ventilation for over 3 years following the diagnosis of 'brain death'.

Both committee reports assert that the presence of a beating heart in the patient meeting diagnostic criteria for 'brain death' is a function of the ventilator. This claim deserves careful scrutiny. Consider patient A, who meets diagnostic criteria for 'brain death'. Patient A has passed the acute phase of the condition, did not succumb to the serious complications associated with the process of the injury itself and is now relatively physiologically stable, 6 weeks after meeting diagnostic criteria for 'brain death'. Patient A is receiving tube feeding through the stomach and is not in need of medications to maintain blood pressure or vasopressin to regulate urine output.

### Rationalizing definitions and procedures for optimizing clinical care and public health in fetal death and stillbirth [^116XRwrU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the recent focus on stillbirth, there remains a profound need to address problems associated with the definitions and procedures related to fetal death and stillbirth. The current definition of fetal death, first proposed in 1950, needs to be updated to distinguish between the timing of fetal death (which has etiologic and prognostic significance) and the timing of stillbirth (ie, the delivery of the dead fetus). Stillbirth registration procedures, modeled after live birth registration and not death registration, also need to be modernized because they can be an unnecessary burden on some grieving families. The problems associated with fetal death definitions and stillbirth-associated procedures are highlighted by selective fetal reduction in multifetal pregnancy; in many countries, the fetus reduced at 10–13 weeks of gestation and delivered at term gestation requires stillbirth registration and a burial permit even if fetal remains cannot be identified. An international consensus is needed to standardize the definition of reportable fetal deaths; ideally this should be based on the timing of fetal death and should address the status of pregnancy terminations. In this article, we list propositions for initiating an international dialogue that will rationalize fetal death definitions, registration criteria, and associated procedures, and thereby improve clinical care and public health.

### Ethical and legal approaches to' the fetal patient' [^1126RUua]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2003). Low credibility.

The concept of fetuses being 'patients' can serve a benign protective, cautionary purpose, alerting healthcare providers and pregnant women to the implications that medical treatment can have for fetuses. The concept allows women to provide the children they intend to deliver with the care they consider appropriate. A negative effect occurs, however, if healthcare providers decide to treat pregnant women according to providers' own views of the best interests of fetuses, and compromise patients' care and self-determination without their informed consent. Some activists advocate rights of fetuses for the purpose of limiting pregnant women's self-determination. Recognition that fetuses have legitimate interests, rather than rights, is common, and opens a way to balancing various competing interests without compromising patients' rights to decide on their medical care. Courts of law generally favor this approach, and tend to allow few limits on women's choice of indicated medical care while pregnant.

### Improving the reporting of clinical trials of infertility treatments (IMPRINT): modifying the CONSORT statement [^111FzCPP]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

Infertility trial reporting — live birth definitions and viability thresholds — there is no consensus on the minimum gestational duration to qualify as a live birth, definitions vary across agencies, and the authors promote a uniform approach. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology defines live birth as delivery of one or more live‑born infants with no gestational‑age cutoff and counts delivery of multiple infants as one live birth, whereas the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics considers a live‑born infant with one or more stillborns to be a singleton birth, thus underestimating multiple pregnancies. ICMART defines a delivery as "after 20 completed weeks of gestational age", but defines a live birth "regardless of the duration of the pregnancy", so even a fetus born at 18 weeks may show signs of life without survival. The page notes 20 weeks as the dividing point between nonviable and potentially viable pregnancies, the window of viability as between 23 and 24 weeks' gestation, and that live births after 20–22 weeks have virtually no chance of survival. To standardize reporting and enable comparison with public birth records, the authors state "we recommend using the WHO definition of live birth as any infant born alive with a gestational age ≥ 20 weeks".

### The ethics and practice of perinatal care at the limit of viability: FIGO recommendations [^117YBhQV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

An arbitrary gestational age limit of viability cannot be set, and in clinical practice the focus should be on a periviability interval-the so-called "gray zone" of prognostic uncertainty. For cases within this interval, the most appropriate decision-making process remains debatable and periviability has emerged as one of the greatest challenges in bioethics. Universally recognized ethical principles may be interpreted differently due to socioeconomic, cultural, and religious aspects. In the case of periviability, there is considerable uncertainty over whether interventions result in a greater balance of clinical good over harm. Furthermore, the fetus or neonate is unable to exercise autonomy and the physicians and parents will act as patient surrogates. When parents and physicians disagree about the infant's best interest, a dialogue without paternalistic attitudes is essential, whereby physicians should only offer, but not recommend, perinatal interventions. Parental choice, based on thorough information, should be respected within the limits of what is medically feasible and appropriate. When disagreements between parents and physicians occur, how is consensus to be achieved? Professional guidelines can be helpful as a framework and starting point for discussion. In reality, however, guidelines only rarely draw categorical lines and in many cases remain vague and ambiguously worded. Local ethics committees can provide counseling and function as moderators during discussions, but ethics committees do not have decision precedence. Counseling assumes the most significant role in periviability discussions, taking into consideration the particular fetal and maternal characteristics, as well as parental values. Several caveats should be observed relative to counseling: message fragmentation or inconsistence should be minimized, prognosis should preferably be presented in a positive framing, and overreliance on statistics should be avoided. It is recommended that decisions regarding neonatal resuscitation in the periviability interval be made before birth and not conditional on the newborn's appearance at birth. Regardless of decision, it is important to assure pre- and postnatal coherence. The present article describes how individual physicians, centers, and countries differ in the approach to the decision to initiate or forgo intensive care in the periviability interval. It is impossible to provide a global consensus view and there can be no unifying ethical, moral, or practical strategy. Nevertheless, ethically justified, quality care comprises early involvement of the obstetric and neonatal team to enable a coherent, comprehensible, nonpaternalistic, and balanced plan of care. Ultimately, physicians will need to adjust the expectations to the local standards, local outcome data, and local neonatal support availability.

### The limits of viability [^112r6xm8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

In fact, clinicians are guided systematically to get the distinction between fetal and pregnancy viability wrong. One example is in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes, published by the World Health Organization, used for billing, research, and other health services (Table 1). In particular, the code O36.80X_ is described as, "pregnancy with inconclusive fetal viability". This code is most often used during an early pregnancy encounter, such as an ultrasonogram, during which the pregnancy's location and potential are assessed. A code describing fetal viability is applied to a situation to determine pregnancy viability.

Table 1.
Examples of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Diagnosis Codes Using the Term "Viability"

Failing to be specific in terminology has harmful implications. For example, telling someone being evaluated for early pregnancy that their ultrasonogram shows a viable pregnancy at 8 weeks of gestation can be confusing for someone who has heard the word viability applied in the context of abortion. Another patient with an ectopic pregnancy with ultrasonographically detectable cardiac activity might be led to believe, falsely, that her pregnancy has progressed to the point of newborn survival.

Fetal viability depends largely on fetal organ maturity, which is a function of gestational age. As noted above, the viability of a fetus means having reached such a stage of development as to be capable of living, under normal conditions, outside the pregnancy. Viability exists as a function of obstetric and neonatal medical care, the content and capacity of which vary dramatically across the United States and the world. Notably, the viability of an individual fetus is also influenced by other specific circumstances of that fetus, for instance the presence or absence of structural anomalies, fetal weight, amniotic fluid levels during the pregnancy, and presence of infection.

The terminology of viability cannot be avoided. But we can and must be clearer among ourselves, with society at large, and, above all, with our patients. When using these terms, we should be specific about distinguishing between pregnancy viability and fetal viability. Primarily, we should never let the word viability hang on its own, such as, "Ultrasound demonstrates viability". Wherever possible, we should use plain language to describe the situation, such as, "Ultrasound demonstrates a 10-week fetus with cardiac activity".

### Maternal brain death and somatic support [^111AyDBV]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Brain death is a concept used in situations in which life-support equipment obscures the conventional cardiopulmonary criteria of death, and it is legally recognized in most countries worldwide. Brain death during pregnancy is an occasional and tragic occurrence. The mother and fetus are two distinct organisms, and the death of the mother mandates consideration of the well-being of the fetus. Where maternal brain death occurs after the onset of fetal viability, the benefits of prolonging the pregnancy to allow further fetal maturation must be weighed against the risks of continued time in utero, and preparations must be made to facilitate urgent cesarean section and fetal resuscitation at short notice. Where the fetus is nonviable, one must consider whether continuation of maternal organ supportive measures in an attempt to attain fetal viability is appropriate, or whether it constitutes futile care. Although the gestational age of the fetus is central to resolving this issue, there is no clear upper physiological limit to the prolongation of somatic function after brain death. Furthermore, medical experience regarding prolonged somatic support is limited and can be considered experimental therapy. This article explores these issues by considering the concept of brain death and how it relates to somatic death. The current limits of fetal viability are then discussed. The complex ethical issues and the important variations in the legal context worldwide are considered. Finally, the likelihood of successfully sustaining maternal somatic function for prolonged periods and the medical and obstetric issues that are likely to arise are examined.

### The fetus, the "potential child, " and the ethical obligations of obstetricians [^111qzKj1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The right of pregnant women to refuse obstetric interventions is an established tenet of obstetric ethics. However, that does not mean that fetal considerations are inconsequential. Although respect for negative autonomy is largely a settled issue, what is less clear is the degree to which a pregnant woman's affirmative autonomy (the right to demand) should be controlling. We discuss the ethical basis for deciding when a pregnant woman's affirmative autonomy should be decisive. We focus on the ethical consequences when a fetus is considered a "potential child" because of a woman's decision to continue a pregnancy. Her intention determines the relevance and nature of the interests of the future child. Although fetal interests may temporally approach those of a born child, they are, in all cases, still circumscribed by the de facto circumstance of the potential child, ie, the child cannot be treated without treating the mother. That treatment would implicate the pregnant woman's right to bodily integrity. This right is so fundamental to our conception of autonomy that its trespass should give serious pause to all who respect basic human dignity. Accordingly, the future interests of a child should not constrain a pregnant woman's right of negative autonomy (the right to refuse any intervention intended for the putative benefit of the fetus or herself). However, the interests of the potential child may factor into considerations of affirmative autonomy and, in parallel, on a physician's right to refuse a particular intervention or plan of care.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^113Pmo7H]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Stillbirth

Whilst fetal death is the death of the fetus in utero, stillbirth refers to the delivery, or birth, of a baby after such a death. Delivery typically occurs spontaneously or planned in consultation with health providers and affected parents, within days of fetal death. Occasionally, weeks or longer between the fetus' death and its delivery or stillbirth.

A stillbirth is a baby born following a fetal death at 154 days (22 +0 completed weeks) or more of gestation.

Gestational age subgroups

Early gestation stillbirth is a stillbirth between 154 and 195 days of gestation (22 +0–27 +6 weeks).

Late gestation stillbirth is a stillbirth at 196 or more days gestation (≥ 28 +0 weeks).

If no gestational age information is available birth weight ≥ 500 g can be used as a proxy for stillbirth, with early gestation stillbirths ≥ 500 to < 1000 g and late gestation stillbirths ≥ 1000 g.

Stillbirths by timing

Antepartum stillbirth is a stillbirth following antepartum fetal death (before onset of labor). Intrapartum stillbirth is a stillbirth following intrapartum fetal death (occurring during labor).

Every effort should be made to assess and record the vital status of the fetus for all women presenting in labor to the health facility. Skin appearance is a poor proxy for stillbirth timing and should only be used when the vital status of the baby at the onset of labor, or admission to the health facility is unknown. In these cases macerated stillbirth (presence of maceration at delivery) suggests antepartum death, while fresh stillbirth (no maceration) suggests intrapartum death.

Live birth

A live birth is the delivery of a baby, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which after such separation shows signs of life. Signs of life at birth include breathing, beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord and definite movement of voluntary muscles whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Fleeting reflex activity, defined as automatic involuntary reflexes triggered by stimuli such as touch or temperature changes, observed only in the first minute after birth does not warrant classification as a sign of life.

Total births

The sum of stillbirths and live births. If the lower limit of stillbirth used differs from 154 days (22 +0 completed weeks), for example ≥ 196 days (≥ 28 +0 weeks) for international reporting, this should be clearly stated.

### One life ends, another begins: management of a brain-dead pregnant mother – A systematic review- [^111VTctQ]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Clinically, following the onset of BD, it is possible to sustain a brain-dead mother's somatic functions over a longer period. Manifold physiological changes occurring during pregnancy and brain death, as well as the prolonged hospital stay after BD, present enormous challenges, however, both for the treating clinicians and for the family. The important question is from which gestational age onward should the pregnancy be supported? At present, it seems that there is no clear lower limit to the gestational age which would restrict the physician's efforts to support the brain-dead mother and her fetus. As reported by Slattery et al. a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. At 24, 28 and 32 weeks, a fetus has approximately a 20–30%, 80% and 98% likelihood of survival with a 40%, 10% and less than 2% chance of suffering from a severe handicap, respectively. Therefore, depending on maternal stability and fetal growth, the decision must be made on an individual basis. According to our findings, prolonged somatic support can lead to the delivery of a viable child with satisfactory Apgar score and birthweight. Such children can also develop normally without any problems resulting from their intrauterine conditions. Furthermore, after the delivery, mothers could be considered as potential organ donors. In Figure 2, we summarize the recommendations for the critical care management of brain-dead pregnant women. This schema is not a definitive guideline, because the technical support and the experience of the responsible medical team must also be taken under consideration. Also, the number of reported cases is too small to define the rate at which intensive care support of the brain-dead mother can result in a healthy infant. The percentage of successful cases cannot be determined, because there are no reports describing failure of intensive maternal support from all medical centers. Finally, it cannot be established whether a relative infrequency of cases such as those that we found in the published literature reflects the rarity of the event, perfect success in all prior situations, reluctance to initiate intensive efforts required to support the brain-dead patient or simply publication bias.

Figure 2
Recommendations for the management of maternal brain death. GA, gestational age.

However, we maintain that the management of a brain-dead pregnant woman should follow the existent standards, guidelines and recommendations both for nontraumatic therapy for the fetus and organ-preserving treatment for the donor.

### Optimal fetal growth: a misconception? [^113L8FPd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Alterations in fetal growth trajectory, either in terms of individual organs or the fetal body, constitute part of a suite of adaptive responses that the fetus can make to a developmental challenge such as inadequate nutrition. Nonetheless, despite substantial changes in nutrition in many countries over recent centuries, mean birthweight has changed relatively little. Low birthweight is recognized as a risk factor for later noncommunicable disease, although the developmental origins of such risk are graded across the full range of fetal growth and birthweight. Many parental and environmental factors, some biological and some cultural, can influence fetal growth, and these should not be viewed as abnormal. We argue that the suggestion of establishing a universal standard for optimal fetal growth ignores the breadth of these normal fetal responses. It may influence practice adversely, through incorrect estimation of gestational age and unnecessary elective deliveries. It raises ethical as well as practical issues.

### Ethics of research in perinatal medicine [^113MzquY]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Ethics is an essential component of fetal research. From definitions of medical ethics and the ethical principles of beneficence and respect for autonomy, we identify the ethical concept of the fetus as a patient. We then identify major components of research ethics. On these 2 bases, we identify ethically justified criteria for initiating study of innovative fetal interventions, for randomized trials in fetal research, for making the clinical, scientific, and ethical judgment that fetal research has produced a new standard of care, and for stopping rules for fetal research.

### Medical paternalism and the fetus [^116pgE7E]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

A number of developments in the medical field have changed the debate about the ethics of abortion. These developments include: advances in fetal physiology, the increase in neonatal intensive care and the survival rates of premature infants. This paper discusses the idea of selective termination and the effects that these decisions have on disabled people of today. It presents a critique of the counselling services that are provided for the parents of a disabled fetus and discusses how this is viewed from a social perspective. The article ends with an argument that the mother deserves to be autonomous in the decision of abortion. The easiest and most fair way to develop her autonomy is to consider the relationship between a professional and a mother as an expert-expert relationship. Here both parties are considered experts in diagnostic information, treatment options, possibilities, and their history, family roots, philosophy and way of life, respectively.

### Stillbirth: we can do better [^112fx6XY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Stillbirth is far too common, occurring in millions of pregnancies per year globally. The rate of stillbirth (defined as death of a fetus prior to birth at 20 weeks' gestation or more) in the United States is 5.73 per 1000. This is approximately 1 in 175 pregnancies accounting for about 21,000 stillbirths per year. Although rates are much higher in low-income countries, the stillbirth rate in the United States is much higher than most high resource countries. Moreover, there are substantial disparities in stillbirth, with rates twice as high for non-Hispanic Black and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders compared to non-Hispanic Whites. There is considerable opportunity for reduction in stillbirths, even in high resource countries such as the United States. In this article, we review the epidemiology, risk factors, causes, evaluation, medical and emotional management, and prevention of stillbirth. We focus on novel data regarding genetic etiologies, placental assessment, risk stratification, and prevention.

### Causes of death and associated conditions (codac): a utilitarian approach to the classification of perinatal deaths [^113ZuTNj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

The continuum of perinatal loss

The numerator in perinatal mortality classification is the number of individual fetuses entering the perinatal period alive, and dying before it ends. The perinatal period is defined (see table 4) by the WHO as being ≥ 500 grams, and only secondarily ≥ 22 weeks, as gestational age is often unknown in developing countries. Yet, in practice, gestational age has been used interchangeably with birthweight in many settings, and most legal implications are linked to gestational age. Gestation at birth is commonly used, but should be corrected if time of intrauterine death is known. Valid arguments can be made for other limits of gestation, but for uniform reporting the limit at 500 grams/22 weeks is internationally established, and the WHO also recommend reporting data for international comparisons with the limits 1000 grams/28 weeks/35 cm. Nonetheless, communities who use lower limits should register and classify all their cases and causes of death accordingly, and many would favor also registering late neonatal deaths until the 28 th postnatal day (rather than the 7 th postnatal day) to capture more deaths with origins in perinatal events.

It should be noted that mean birthweight of stillbirths is significantly below 500 g at 22 completed weeks. Communities using the birthweight criterion will underestimate their stillbirth rate compared with regions using gestational age. In a population-based material with close to universal ultrasound-dating, 10.4% of stillbirths (> 22 weeks) would be unreported if the birthweight criterion was used.

In addition to variations in definitions, incomplete registrations, and differences in registration preferences and cultures, two classification issues hamper comparisons of stillbirth rates: "truncated" data due to terminations of pregnancy, and the "transfers" from stillbirths to neonatal deaths due to medical interventions (e.g. early delivery for hypertensive disorders). To enable interpretation of cause-specific perinatal death rates, information on both terminations and neonatal deaths must be managed together with stillbirths.

### The fetus in the age of the genome [^114vMRuW]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

There can be only one (patient)?

The new and exciting prospects in prenatal diagnosis and treatment give rise to an understanding of the unborn and fetus as a patient with all related consequences for clinical care pathways in prenatal medicine (Casper). We owe much insight into the theoretical basis of this concept to Laurence McCullough and Frank Chervenak, who in the 1980s began to elaborate on the professional duties towards a pregnant woman and the fetus as patients (Chervenak and McCullough). Being a patient since the eighteenth century is frequently described as a social role for "the sick", created by physicians becoming professionals (McCullough). The concept emphasizes a commitment of physicians to their "responsibility to protect and promote the health-related and other interests of the individual under their care" (McCullough and Chervenak). By identifying the fetus as a patient, it is given a dependent moral status which comes along with beneficence-based (not rights-based) obligations of health care professionals. The authors repeatedly stressed that in this understanding the fetus is neither required to be seen as separate from the pregnant woman, nor has an independent moral status and therefore does not restrict the rights of pregnant women (McCullough and Chervenak). But the adequacy and applicability of the concept is still under considerable debate (Lyerly et al; Rodrigues et al; Schmitz et al.), and convincing alternatives have not been elaborated so far.

### Deprivations, futures and the wrongness of killing [^1138dK3S]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

In my essay, Why abortion is immoral, I criticised discussions of the morality of abortion in which the crucial issue is whether fetuses are human beings or whether fetuses are persons. Both argument strategies are inadequate because they rely on indefensible assumptions. Why should being a human being or being a person make a moral difference? I argued that the correct account of the morality of abortion should be based upon a defensible account of why killing children and adults is wrong. I claimed that what makes killing us wrong is that our premature deaths deprive us of our futures of value, that is, the goods of life we would have experienced had we survived. This account of the wrongness of killing explains why killing is one of the worst of crimes and how killing greatly harms the victim. It coheres with the attitudes of those with cancer or HIV facing premature death. It explains why we believe it is wrong to kill infants (as personhood theories do not). It does not entail that it wrongs a human being to end her life if she is in persistent vegetative state or if her future must consist only of unbearable physical suffering and she wants to die (as sanctity of human life theories do not). This account of the wrongness of killing implies (with some defensible additional assumptions) that abortion is immoral because we were fetuses once and we know those fetuses had futures of value. Mark Brown claims that this potential future of value account is unsound because it implies that we have welfare rights to what we need to stay alive that most people would reject. I argue that Brown is incorrect in two ways: a welfare right to what we need to stay alive is not directly implied by my account and, in addition, most of us do believe that dependent human beings have substantial welfare rights to what they need to stay alive. Brown argues that depriving us of a future of value of which we have mental representations both is a better explanation of the wrongness of killing and does not imply that abortion is immoral. I reply that (a) if Brown's arguments against my view were sound, those arguments could be easily adapted to show that his view is unsound as well and (b) Brown's view is both ambiguous and unsound on any interpretation. The most popular class of pro-choice argument strategies appeals to the view that some or all fetuses lack either a mental state or function or a capacity for a mental state or function necessary for possession of the right to life. Desires, interests, sentience, various concepts, moral agency, and rationality have all been suggested as candidates for this crucial mental role. Brown's analysis is one member of this class of strategies. I believe that it is possible to show that none of these strategies is reasonable. However, there are so many of these strategies that the required argument demands something more like a book and less like a short essay. The argument of the following essay is a piece of this larger argument.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^113TpvjF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound (US) terminology — cardiac activity and viability language is specified as follows: Cardiac is a scientifically accurate adjective as endorsed by ACOG, and the rate of cardiac activity, as documented on M-mode, should be reported as beats per minute. The terms 'live', 'living', and 'viable' have been used frequently to refer to any pregnancy with cardiac activity; We recommend against the use of all these terms in the first trimester. Fetal viability has been defined as the ability of a fetus to survive in the extrauterine environment and thus is not applicable in the first trimester. Avoiding the terms 'nonviable' and 'pregnancy of uncertain viability' is therefore recommended. Likewise, a US examination in the first trimester should be called first-trimester US or early pregnancy US and not a 'viability' scan.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^1144oeMe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Obstetric care consensus — definition and reporting thresholds — fetal death is defined as the delivery of a fetus showing no signs of life based on absent breathing, heartbeats, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite voluntary movements. Reporting is suggested for fetal deaths at 20 weeks or greater of gestation (if known) or for a weight greater than or equal to 350 g if gestational age is unknown. The cutoff of 350 g is the 50th percentile of weight at 20 weeks of gestation. US vital statistics data are collected for fetal deaths with a stated or presumed period of gestation of 20 weeks or more, and terminations for life-limiting fetal anomalies and for previable premature rupture of membranes are specifically excluded and classified as terminations of pregnancy. The term stillbirth is preferred among parent groups and is used in this document.

### Causes of death and associated conditions (codac): a utilitarian approach to the classification of perinatal deaths [^113toWdB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

If several pathologies are present, while no direct association indicate one of them as the underlying cause of the other(s), the most significant lethal condition is coded as COD (rule 3, table 2), but if equally significant they are coded as follows:

1) If related conditions, the pathology considered to occur first is coded as the COD (due to the probability that the first caused the second) (rule 4, table 2). E.g. isolated multiple infarctions of the placenta and placental abruption. 2) For unrelated conditions, the last to occur is coded as COD (due to evident survival of the first condition) (rule 5, table 2). E.g. an infection and true knots of the cord with evidence of circulatory compromise. 3) When no indication of timing is available, the hierarchical approach described below is used (rule 6, table 2).

The assumption of mutually exclusive categories makes limited clinical sense, most cases having several contributing causes, but Codac categories are distinctive – with one significant exception: Infections are coded in two separate positions comparable to ICD: First by infectious agents (codes 0xx), and second by site of infection (codes 19x, 49x, 59x, 69x, 79x) (rule 7, table 2). Even infections by unknown agent are coded as COD by unspecified infection (code 000) with site of infection in the second position to retain the information. In neonatal congenital infections (contracted by definition in fetal life), site of the underlying infection is coded in the second position among fetal infections (codes 49x).

As previously discussed, registrations of terminations must be based on a compromise. In Codac, we recommend reporting all terminations 1) in the perinatal period, and 2) for conditions constituting a perinatal COD – starting whenever consistent registration is feasible after 12 completed weeks. Terminations in cases of inevitable death, e.g. inductions prior to 22 weeks for inevitable pregnancy loss in chorioamnionitis with preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (PPROM), or for maternal health issues such as severe preeclampsia, should only be registered if the natural history of the disease or condition indicated that they were expected to enter the perinatal period alive. In Codac, terminations are coded in category 9 and to gain information on how terminations affect mortality rates, the reason for termination is coded both in the main and subsequent categories (rule 8, table 2).

### Does advanced maternal age confer a survival advantage to infants born at early gestation? [^111LDRLm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

While the fetuses-at-risk-based measures of gestational age-specific perinatal mortality represent a causal model, there are some conceptual challenges regarding the optimal analytical approach to model these time-to-event perinatal data. The Cox model constitutes a robust analytical tool for multivariable survival analysis which assumes that censoring is non-informative. This creates a significant problem in perinatal studies wherein stillbirth and live birth represent competing risks in studies of stillbirth (and stillbirth and neonatal death represent competing risks in studies of neonatal death). The competing risk issue between stillbirth and neonatal death is simply resolved by using perinatal death as an outcome, though there are socio-cultural reasons that may require studies to focus on stillbirths or neonatal deaths separately. Logistic regression analyses based on fetuses-at-risk approach and focusing on perinatal death (as done in this study) offer a practical analytical approach to avoiding some of these problems and also address the potential bias introduced by the traditional approach when examining causal associations at early gestation.

The strength of our study includes the use of a large population-based dataset with information collected according to uniform protocols across the United States. The limitations include some degree of data inaccuracy that is inevitable in large administrative databases. The ascertainment of gestational age in vital statistics has been traditionally based on menstrual dating, although a clinical estimate of gestation based on early ultrasound is available for recent years. In this study we used the more accurate clinical estimate of gestation and excluded births without such an estimate. Some congenital anomalies were likely underreported and this may have affected some estimates in our study. We did not have information on socio-economic status, body mass index and behavioural factors such as substance use or alcohol consumption that are known to be associated with maternal age and perinatal outcomes. Finally, we ascribed time of fetal or neonatal death to the time of birth (in gestational weeks). The former assumption was made because time of fetal death was not available in our data source. For neonatal deaths, we assumed an antepartum cause of death among infants who died during the neonatal period. The time between birth and neonatal death was therefore considered a latent period between the birth of a compromised fetus and neonatal death.

### ACR appropriateness criteria assessment of fetal well-being [^114cArZC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Although there is limited evidence that antepartum testing decreases the risk for fetal death in low-risk pregnancies, women with high-risk factors for stillbirth should undergo antenatal fetal surveillance. The strongest evidence supporting antepartum testing pertains to pregnancies complicated by intrauterine fetal growth restriction secondary to uteroplacental insufficiency. The main ultrasound-based modalities to determine fetal health are the biophysical profile, modified biophysical profile, and duplex Doppler velocimetry. In patients at risk for cardiovascular compromise, fetal echocardiography may also be indicated to ensure fetal well-being. Although no single antenatal test has been shown to be superior, all have high negative predictive values. Weekly or twice-weekly fetal testing has become the standard practice in high-risk pregnancies. The timing for the initiation of assessments of fetal well-being should be tailored on the basis of the risk for stillbirth and the likelihood of survival with intervention. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Babies born at the threshold of viability: changes in survival and workload over 20 years [^112Sa7WM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

What is known on this topic

Babies born at the threshold of viability create a wide range of polarised opinions regarding decisions about their care and management.
Current recommendations suggest babies born at 24 weeks of gestation should normally receive active intervention while babies born at 23 weeks of gestation should be discussed with parents regarding whether such intervention is appropriate.

What this paper adds

This work demonstrates that babies of 25 weeks of gestation or less consume a very significant amount of intensive care.
The resources allocated to these babies have increased over time, and survival has significantly increased in babies born at 24 and 25 weeks.
There has been little change in the outcome of babies born at 23 weeks of gestation in the UK over 20 years and many ultimately die.

### Treatment of poor placentation and the prevention of associated adverse outcomes – what does the future hold? [^112v2Dp5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

HOW CAN NOVEL THERAPIES BE TRANSLATED INTO THE CLINIC?

To achieve real benefit for the future health of pregnant women, effective therapies must be brought from the realm of research into clinical practice. This process is hampered, however, by the reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the development of new obstetric drugs or to licence existing drugs for use in pregnancy. This reluctance may arise from a fear of litigation combined with the practical and ethical complexity of conducting obstetric clinical trials, which must take into account not only the pregnant woman, the fetus, and long-term neonatal follow-up but also the diseases that currently have heterogeneous manifestations and unpredictable clinical progression. To some extent, safety considerations can be addressed with a firm basis of pre-clinical evidence. Ideally, this should include reproductive toxicology studies and evidence of efficacy in an animal model of the disease, taking into account species differences in placental structure and function as well as the timing of different stages of organ development. However, real progress will require greater recognition that excluding pregnant women from clinical trials does not protect them from risk but rather unfairly disadvantages them by restricting their access to evidence-based medicine.–

### Babies born at the threshold of viability: changes in survival and workload over 20 years [^113VnJWW]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although relatively small in number, babies born at or around the limit of viability generate a great deal of public interest and a range of often polarised opinions.

In recent years, the Nuffield Council for Bioethics has reviewed the evidence surrounding the appropriateness of treatment for such babies and updated UK professional guidance has been published. In broad terms, these documents suggest that before 23 weeks of gestation, intervention is not appropriate; at 23 weeks, health professionals should discuss with parents the provision of active intervention given the individual circumstances; while at 24 weeks, the broad expectation would be to proceed with active intervention and intensive care unless a baby was in very poor condition at birth.

Recently one mother has campaigned for a review of these guidelines, particularly with regard to how they relate to the care given to babies born at 21 and 22 weeks following the birth and death of her son at 21 +5 weeks of gestation. In direct contrast, a recent documentary (The Price of Life, by Adam Wishart)debated the issues surrounding active intervention for babies born at 23 weeks gestation given their high mortality and equally high morbidity rate among survivors. In other countries, such as The Netherlands, current policy follows a non-interventionist stance for babies at the limits of viability.

Such differing views were a prominent part of the 2008 abortion debate. One additional factor that emerged at that time was the extent to which outcome, particularly survival, could be related to how hard a particular neonatal service tried to keep such babies alive; even though such data cannot be considered generalisable.

This area remains controversial with only limited data about the care provided to babies born at the extreme of prematurity in the UK over time. While the two EPICure studieshave provided excellent snapshots in the UK, and studies elsewhere have provided similar data regarding other parts of the world,–it is difficult to unravel trends in management or outcome.

We have used existing national and regional datasets to explore the patterns of care provided to these babies over 20 years. This work focuses particularly on changes in the immediate decision making following birth, resource use and short-term outcome during this period.

### Care of late intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth: green-top guideline no. 55 [^114LGodt]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for stillbirth, more specifically with respect to fetal examination, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to offer a full postmortem examination to help explain the cause of a late intrauterine fetal demise.

Panel 1
Stillbirth definitions

The term stillbirth generally applies to a baby born with no signs of life after a given viability threshold, with viability typically assessed on the basis of gestational age, birthweight, or length at birth. A stillbirth is defined as the birth of a baby following fetal death before labour (antepartum stillbirth) or during labour or birth (intrapartum stillbirth). Although most stillbirths occur within hours or days of fetal death, occasionally, such as in the case of twins, this can be delayed by months. For international comparisons of stillbirths, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) definition (ICD 10th and 11th revisions), of late fetal deaths is used. ICD defines late fetal death as the in-utero death of a baby (ie, born with no signs of life at birth) with a birthweight of 1000 g or more; or if birthweight is not available, at a gestational age of 28 weeks or more, or (if gestational age is not available), a body length of 35 cm or more at birth. Early fetal death is defined as the in-utero death of a baby (ie, born with no signs of life at birth) with a birthweight of 500–999 g; or, if birthweight is not available, at a gestational age at birth of 22–27 weeks, or a body length of 25–34 cm at birth. Since gestational age and birthweight thresholds do not perfectly correspond, the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) and the Core Stillbirth Estimation Group (CSEG) recommend the use of gestational age rather than birthweight to define a stillbirth. Gestational age is a better predictor of maturity and hence viability; of note, gestational age is the most commonly available criterion across data sources globally. Gestational age is typically measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, although in circumstances in which early ultrasound dating scans are available, gestational age should be based on the best obstetric estimate to avoid recall errors and differences in the length of menstrual cycles. Recommendations from the UN IGME and the CSEG also include omitting the birth length criterion and making a clearer distinction between stillbirth and fetal death. These recommendations are under review for inclusion in an updated edition of ICD-11.

### Stillbirths: rates, risk factors, and acceleration towards 2030 [^111BCcK7]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on stillbirth:

- **Definition**: Stillbirth is defined as the death of a fetus in utero or the delivery of a fetus with no signs of life at ≥ 20 weeks of gestation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of stillbirth often involves impaired placental function, which can lead to fetal growth restriction or preterm labor. Other factors include genetic abnormalities, infections, fetal-maternal hemorrhage, umbilical cord complications, and various maternal medical conditions.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of stillbirth in the US is estimated at 5.96 per 1,000 births, with 3.01 per 1,000 for early stillbirths (20–27 weeks of gestation) and 2.97 per 1,000 for late stillbirths (> 28 weeks of gestation).
- **Risk factors**: Several risk factors are associated with stillbirth, including advanced maternal age, obesity, pre-existing diabetes, chronic hypertension, smoking, alcohol use, nulliparity, multiple gestation, and non-Hispanic Black race.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of stillbirth can vary, but it often involves a period of decreased fetal movement followed by the absence of fetal heart tones.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for future pregnancies after a stillbirth depends on the underlying cause and the presence of any modifiable risk factors.

Box 1
Decision rules for prioritisation by the Executive Guideline Steering Group (GSG)

There is a substantial number of new effectiveness or otherstudies or reports in relation to the question, and these studies have not yet been assessed or included in a systematic review, particularly if the new data may relate to priority outcomes and or harms/safety. These new data may lead to changes in: Estimates and CIs for specific outcomes. Certainty of the evidence for specific outcomes. Recommended dose or intensity of an intervention. Recommended timing of an intervention (eg, gestational age). Recommended subgroups for whom an intervention is effective (age groups, disease severity, etc). Recommended route through which the intervention is delivered/administered. Supporting interventions required. Level of care/type of providers for delivering/administering the intervention.
There is a substantial number of new efficacy studies/reports in relation to the question, and these studies have not yet been assessed or included in a systematic review. Not including these studies may undermine the credibility of the recommendation, even if this is already a strong recommendation.
There is a new drug or intervention in relation to a health issue, and data are now available.
The recommendation is 'general' in relation to a class of drugs (eg, antihypertensives) and does not specify the use of a particular drug. There is now new evidence that suggests that the recommendation needs to be narrowed to a particular drug/s or suggests that particular drug/s are not effective or are less effective.
The identification of definitional, consistency or interpretation issues in existing recommendations: The definition of a clinical condition (eg, definition of 'severe hypertension') or of other relevant issues, and/or how the clinical condition is diagnosedor diagnostic criteria, have changed substantially since the recommendation was made. The wording of the recommendation is ambiguous, unclear or could be improved substantially (eg, in relation to drug dosages). There are inconsistencies between recommendations (eg, in drug dosages, route of administration) that may lead to misunderstandings. Guideline users in service delivery settings have indicated that the recommendation is hard to understand or interpret.
There have been wide-scale changes in technologies (or access to technologies) that impact on clinical practice (eg, the viability of the fetus at particular gestational ages) and/or what life-saving interventions that can be delivered.
A related recommendation has changed or has been prioritised for updating.
New synthesis methods (such as network meta-analysis or individual patient data meta-analysis) may give new findings and/or allow comparisons and subgroup analyses that were not possible previously.
The Executive GSG is of the view that a recommendation should be viewed as a good practice statement (or vice versa).
The question underlying the recommendation needs to be revisited: It is not clear if the question is still relevant. The question is still relevant but needs to be unpacked or broken down further into subquestions. For example, a recommendation that health promotion is recommended needs to be broken down to consider which kinds of health promotion interventions are effective and can be recommended.
Where the development of an existing recommendation was driven strongly by evidence related to how people value outcomes, or the acceptability, feasibility, equity or cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and there are changes (or potential changes) in the supporting evidence regarding these criteria.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^115FnETu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — counseling, assessment, and monitoring guidance is stratified for anticipated deliveries between 23 0/7 weeks and 25 6/7 weeks of gestation, and clinicians should discuss with parents whether the goal is optimizing survival or minimizing suffering, recognizing that antenatal and postdelivery care may differ depending on parental preferences regarding resuscitation. A recommendation regarding assessment for resuscitation is not meant to indicate that resuscitation should always either be undertaken or deferred, or that every possible intervention need be offered; a stepwise approach concordant with neonatal circumstances and condition and with parental wishes is appropriate, with care reevaluated regularly and potentially redirected as the clinical situation evolves. A decision to proceed with resuscitation should be informed by individual circumstances, including estimated fetal weight, the most precise estimate of gestational age, family values and wishes, and ongoing evaluation of fetal or neonatal condition; a decision not to undertake resuscitation of a liveborn infant should be seen as redirection to comfort measures, not the absence of care. The guidelines offer recommendations on gestational ages at which assessment for resuscitation rather than resuscitation itself should be undertaken, and assign the less directive recommendation of "consider" to some guidance because of very limited evidence. Continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring is not separately considered as an intervention because its use will usually be linked to cesarean delivery plans for fetal indications; if arrangements have been made for resuscitation of a potentially viable liveborn neonate, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring may be considered if intrauterine resuscitation is believed to affect the newborn's outcome.

### Twenty-five years after the FIGO guidelines for the use of fetal monitoring: time for a simplified approach? [^114ea2Zn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

Twenty-five years after the FIGO Workshop that produced the "Guidelines for the use of fetal monitoring", these remain the only broad international consensus effort in this field. Documents of a similar nature have been produced by national institutions, with subsequent updates of the initial concepts. The 3-class classification system has now been adopted by all the major guidelines, and while there are numerous similar features, and indeed many ideas were inspired by the FIGO guidelines, many key aspects still lack consensus. Making guidelines simpler and more objective may be an important step to guarantee a wide application and assimilation of the recommendations, as well as an enhanced reproducibility and increased memory retention.

### Sudden intrauterine unexplained death: time to adopt uniform postmortem investigative guidelines? [^111QTLAz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal deaths, particularly at or near term, are the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes and the leading contributor to perinatal mortality. In 2015 there were 2.6 million stillbirths globally, with more than 7178 deaths a day. The majority of these deaths occurred in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes a rate in sub-Saharan Africa approximately 10 times that of developed countries (29 vs. 3 per 1000 births). Other sources are providing similar epidemiology with a rate of about 5 per 1000 in developed countries.

Obviously, parents want to know why their baby died in the womb and the chance of recurrence in future pregnancies. Therefore, the detection of the pathogenetic mechanism leading to stillbirth is very important, not just to give an answer to parents, but also to introduce preventive measures in order to lower the perinatal mortality.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^114XySfA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Lower thresholds for reporting of deaths

ICD‐11 recommends including all stillbirths and deaths following live birth if gestational age is at least 154 days (≥ 22 +0 weeks). When gestational age is unavailable, the birth weight proxy (≥ 500 g) can be used. If the gestational age and birth weight are unknown it is recommended to include the case in the perinatal mortality statistics if there is a strong probability the event occurred after the defined reporting point for perinatal mortality.

Fetal deaths

National reporting requirements for fetal deaths vary, with legal thresholds often closer to the boundaries of fetal viability for example, 20 +0 to 28 +0 weeks (140–196 days) than the start of the fetal period. Recording fetal deaths from 140 days (20 +0 weeks) in local health data collection systems can improve capture and accuracy of reporting from 22 +0 weeks. The lower limit used for data recording should be specified in the statistics produced.

Deaths following live birth

ICD‐11 recommends recording all deaths following live birth, regardless of gestational age. Disparities in capturing and recording neonatal deaths, especially at lower gestational ages, pose a challenge for international comparisons of mortality rates. To address this, ICD‐11 offers clear reporting guidelines to ensure consistency across countries (see below).

Recording of pregnancy losses occurring before the perinatal period

A spontaneous abortion (or miscarriage) is the spontaneous loss of pregnancy (i.e. embryo or fetus) prior to 154 days (22 +0 weeks) gestation. To enable consistency in comparison across countries, spontaneous pregnancy losses < 154 days should always be classified as miscarriages and those ≥ 154 days as stillbirths for international reporting, regardless of local reporting requirements.

Recording of other events in the perinatal period

The above guidance relates to stillbirth and neonatal mortality only and does not include induced abortions, a minority of which occur at or after 154 days (22 +0 weeks).

Artificial termination of an ongoing pregnancy (also referred to as induced abortion, legal abortion, fetal reduction) is defined by ICD‐11 as the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of an embryo or a fetus (irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy), following a deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means, which is not intended to result in a live birth.

All events meeting the definition of artificial termination of pregnancy should be reported in mortality statistics but must be clearly distinguishable from spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Whilst transient signs of life may be present in later‐gestation termination, these should never be coded as live births and neonatal deaths.

### The legal frameworks that govern fetal surgery in the United kingdom, European union, and the United States [^114oEbmC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

5.1 The United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, this is a grey area, as performing medical treatment on a person without consent is to commit assault. 45 As the intervention is for the benefit of the fetus rather than the mother, this appears in contradiction with the law. Currently, there is little impetus to legislate on the matter and no case has been brought before the courts so judgment has simply not been passed; until this is resolved, fetal intervention exists in a grey area that for now is considered legal in so much as the law protects and enshrines maternal rights of autonomy over their bodies.

Fetal intervention is currently governed by existing medical negligence frameworks with the fetus treated as an organ of the mother. This position satisfies the legality question but does not adequately consider the psychosocial burden this places on the mother. There is considerable personal, familial, and societal pressure on pregnant women to act selflessly for their unborn child; she may feel she 'has no choice'. 46, 47 When assessing a prenatal therapy, many pregnant women consider their fetus as a baby, even if they have not attained a 'viable' gestational age. 48 As fetal intervention moves increasingly into the mainstream, placing safeguards to prevent diminution of maternal autonomy may protect mothers in the long run. Furthermore, the fetus's lack of rights prevents its classification as a patient, so it is not supported by the personhood/patienthood structure. However, this is not necessarily relevant; to deduce the status of a being from the treatment given to them is to forget the 'fundamental[ly] different nature of law and medicine'. 49 Although medical practice can help understand these issues, ultimately, it is for the law to decide the status of the fetus.

What is more relevant is that fetal surgery is now established as an effective and successful medical therapy that has brought about an exciting new array of treatments for the fetus. Medical law has throughout history had to adapt with evolving practices, so it seems unlikely that the law will not do so here.

### Fetal assessment near the limits of viability [^1145wAUR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Assessments of gestational age are critical in dealing with the pregnancy at the limits of viability, 22–25-weeks gestation, where neonatal outcomes reveal very significant differences from week to week. The obstetrical team can estimate gestational age within a window of 7–10 days during this critical threshold at the window of viability via determination of last menstrual period, bimanual exam, early pregnancy test, and/or ultrasound. One must also take into account the impact of maternal disease processes, congenital abnormalities, number of fetus(es), and/or fetal growth restriction, along with ongoing evaluation and parental involvement in this decision-making process during the peri-viability period.

### Viability and thresholds for treatment of extremely preterm infants: survey of UK neonatal professionals [^111Mgfki]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

Viability

Almost two-thirds of respondents understood the concept of 'fetal viability' to reflect possibility of survival after birth at a particular gestation (63%); others indicated that that the majority (25%) or vast majority of infants must survive (7%) (table 2). One respondent wrote that they never use the term 'viable' in their practice.

Table 2
Respondents' selections of conceptual elements of a definition of 'viability'

Sixty per cent of participants indicated that likelihood of disability was irrelevant to viability, while some suggested viability should reflect survival without severe disability (34%) or without any disability (4%). One participant wrote that the defining factor was 'Whether it will yield this infant and their family an acceptable quality of life'.

Almost two-thirds of respondents (59%) thought viability reflected survival with medical interventions available to the treating team, while 37% indicated that interventions need not be currently accessible. Comments included that the interventions may not be currently accessible, but should be potentially accessible (eg, within that country) (n = 2), viability reflected survival without medical intervention (n = 4) and viability was associated with presence of a heart rate (presumably prior to medical intervention) (n = 2).

The vast majority of respondents (91%) somewhat or strongly agreed that the gestation at which an infant is considered viable had changed in the last decade (figure 3). Most respondents also agreed that improvements in neonatal intensive care over the last decade changed how they felt about resuscitation (Active Treatment) (84%) or non-resuscitation (Palliative Care) (58%) of infants born at 23 weeks of gestation.

Figure 3
Level of agreement with statements regarding how viability and medical practices change over time (n = 204).

Respondents were divided in their views about the impact of advances in neonatal treatment in the past decade on abortion. Forty per cent indicated such advances changed how they felt about abortion at 23 weeks, while 35% indicated unchanged views. Forty-five per cent agreed that abortion laws should change according to the gestation when a fetus is viable, while 36% disagreed, and 19% neither agreed nor disagreed.

Views on viability were similar between professional groups (online supplemental figure 4).

Assessing the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality — definition and scope specify that a high-risk pregnancy can be defined as a pregnancy in which the woman, fetus, or infant is at significant risk of death or injury due to maternal or fetal conditions or nonmedical, contextual factors.

### Reviewing the womb [^115ykFZG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conflict enshrined in the law: the example of England and Wales

The law is often the mechanism through which ethical and medical ideas about conflict in pregnancy have been translated into a substantial impact on women's bodies and choices. McLean explains that 'the attribution of rights to embryos and fetuses places the mother and conceptus in direct conflict in a number of possible situations'. There are several legal principles which afford recognition to fetuses in ways influenced by conflict framing. Alghrani notes that 'many of the cases that have generated legal rules and principles on the status of the unborn have developed in the context of the abortion debate and cases of maternal–fetal conflict'Thus, they have some notion of inherent conflict at their root.

In England and Wales, it has been established by the courts that the fetus does not have legal personality until birth, and therefore, it does not (and probably never did) have any claim to human rights protection. Moreover, an unborn child cannot be the victim of murder, and manslaughter may only apply if it is delivered alive before subsequently succumbing to its injuries. 9 The fetus cannot be a victim of a non-fatal offence against the person irrespective of whether it survives the injury. A fetus can be, however, the victim of child destruction once it has reached the gestational stage of being capable of life outside its mother's body. The offence of procuring a miscarriage also safeguards fetal life unless one of the grounds specified in the Abortion Act 1967 applied. 10 While the case of Paton, which involved an unsuccessful claim by a putative father seeking to prevent abortion, confirmed that the fetus has no right to life under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 11 abortion law does provide certain protections for fetal life. Section 1 (1)(a) Abortion Act 1967 can be seen to provide little, if any, protection for fetal interests up to 24 weeks gestation, but it is possible for doctors — as gate-keepers — to exercise professional discretion in seeking to discourage abortion, or indeed to refuse to participate as a matter of conscience. It also might be argued that the first ground in the Abortion Act provides real protection to a non-viable fetus because it requires women to justify their terminations in medical terms (though in reference to their own bodies). It remains unlawful for a pregnant person in English law to access termination 'for any reason or no reason'. After 24 weeks the potential for maternal–fetal conflict within the Abortion Act 1967 is more significant. We see, therefore, that abortion law and the Infant Life Preservation Act 1929, in offering greater protection once there is the potential for the fetus to survive ex utero, convey the message that the mature fetus has interests worthy of protection.

### Vital statistics as a data source [^1163i1kW]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

A focus group convened at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stillbirth Conference discussed issues related to vital statistics as a data source on fetal mortality. Fetal death is a tragic occurence and part of the continuum of pregnancy outcomes. A primary source of data is the National Vital Statistics System fetal death component, which is routinely used to track mortality trends and to provide the context for nonrepresentative investigations. The data are also used to examine differentials in mortality by characteristics and to evaluate data quality. Issues concerning how to improve the vital statistics data include culture and context; data instrument; persons providing information; what information is available to the information provider; processing issues; and use of data. Perhaps most important is to enhance recognition of fetal death both for the individual confronting a loss and to promote research. Other studies are needed to augment the information obtainable through vital records.

2 SUMMARY OF ICD‐11 GUIDANCE FOR REPORTING OF DEATHS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD

2.1 Standards and reporting requirements for mortality in perinatal and neonatal periods

This ICD‐11 summary focuses on deaths in the perinatal and neonatal periods, including definitions to distinguish these from miscarriages. Where possible mortality systems should capture data on both fetal deaths and deaths following live birth in a manner that allows disaggregation between the two.

Accurate recording of events in the perinatal period (154 days [or 22 completed weeks, which is written as 22 +0 to indicate 22 completed weeks and 0 days] of gestation to 7 completed days after birth) and neonatal period (0–27 days after birth) requires understanding of key terms used in the standard definitions to classify these events, including birth weight, gestational and chronological age (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Key terms used in perinatal definitions.

2.2 Definitions used in perinatal and neonatal mortality

Figure 1 gives an overview of these definitions.

FIGURE 1
Mortality definitions related to the perinatal period.

Delivery

Deaths in the perinatal and neonatal periods are classified based on their timing in relation to delivery, defined as "the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of a fetus". In the definitions below we have used the more humane terms "birth" or "delivery" to refer to this process.

Fetal death

A fetal death is death of a fetus prior to birth, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy. Fetal death may be diagnosed in utero by absence of fetal heart sounds, confirmed by imaging techniques where available, or by the absence of signs of life after delivery or birth. Fetal deaths are categorized by their timing in relation to the onset of labor:
Antepartum fetal death is a fetal death before the onset of labor.
Intrapartum fetal death is a fetal death during labor.

### Fetal death: expert consensus of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^114MCuEG]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The working group used the GRADE method to formulate recommendations. After analyzing the literature, this method allows determination of the evidence quality and estimating confidence in the effect observed for a given intervention and, ultimately, the strength of the recommendation. There are four evidence quality categories:
High — future research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimated effect.
Moderate — future research is likely to change the confidence in the effect estimate and may change the effect estimate itself.
Low — future research is very likely to affect confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the effect estimate itself and
Very low — the effect estimate is highly uncertain.

An analysis of the quality of evidence is performed for each criterion, and an overall quality of evidence is defined based on the quality of evidence for the predefined criteria, with priority given to those of highest importance. The final wording of recommendations is always binary: positive or negative, and either strong or weak. The strength of the recommendation is determined according to five key factors and validated by expert voting using the GRADE method:
Estimate of effect.
Overall quality of the evidence — the higher the quality of the evidence, the stronger the recommendation. In some cases, the strength of the recommendation was not related to the quality of the evidence. In such cases, the working group provided a rationale.
The balance between desirable and undesirable effects — the more favorable the balance, the stronger the recommendation.
Values and preferences — the greater the uncertainty or variability, the weaker the recommendation. These values and preferences should be obtained as accurately as possible from the stakeholders (patient, physician, decision maker) and
Cost — the higher the cost or use of resources, the weaker the recommendation.

2.2 Literature search

An extensive bibliographic search was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases. To be included in the analysis, publications had to be considered important by the expert panel, written in English or French and published before July 2023.

The pregnant patient presents a unique diagnostic challenge to the urologist because the well-being of both the mother and fetus must be considered. Radiation exposure to the fetus during gestation presents risks such as cell death and teratogenic effects, carcinogenesis, and genetic effects, which must be considered when selecting diagnostic tests. However, with the exercise of good clinical judgment and the use of the armamentarium of diagnostic imaging modalities available, the pregnant patient can be managed with minimal, if any radiation exposure to the fetus.

### Brain death / death by neurologic criteria guidance on communication, objections, pregnancy, and public trust: an AAN position statement [^113Faqdj]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) in a pregnant person — AAN guidance states that after BD/DNC determination in a pregnant person, the ethical analysis should largely focus on the welfare of the fetus, taking into consideration relevant law and anticipated fetal outcome. If the pregnant person executed an advance directive expressing wishes regarding care of the fetus in the event of BD/DNC, the matter should be resolved based on legal advice. Prolonged continuation of organ support after BD/DNC determination in the setting of pregnancy at any gestational age can be considered for the sake of the fetus, and it should be clearly explained that the pregnant person is medically and legally dead and that organ support will be discontinued after completion of the pregnancy. The potential for fetal demise or severe fetal injury even if organ support is continued should be assessed and explained to the family. Where state law allows, the AAN believes that it is appropriate to adhere to the authorized decision maker's interpretation of the pregnant person's preferences regarding continuation of organ support after BD/DNC. Additional context notes that efforts should be made to prolong pregnancy and improve fetal maturity after BD/DNC in a pregnant person if there has not been irreversible damage to the fetus, that there is no mandatory lower gestational age limit for the onset of fetal rescue after BD/DNC determination in a pregnant person, that allowing the fetus to die naturally in utero is appropriate if a severely compromised fetal outcome is anticipated, and that continuation of organ support for the sake of fetal development may be "ethically permissible" if requested by a surrogate decision maker but that it is "unethical to attempt to coerce a surrogate decision maker into continuing organ support" contrary to the pregnant person's preferences or the surrogate's interpretation of their wishes.

### One life ends, another begins: management of a brain-dead pregnant mother – A systematic review- [^115dsTdE]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

At present, BD is a medically and legally accepted event allowing a pronouncement of death. Taking into account that in maternal BD two organisms are involved, the mother and the fetus, a decision whether to maintain the mother's vital functions to allow fetal survival is also an ethical and legal issue. The goal of prolonged maternal somatic support is to deliver a viable and healthy infant with a beneficial long-term outcome. From the medical point of view, the management of a brain-dead pregnant woman should follow the common standards, guidelines and recommendations for organ-preserving therapy. In some situations, however, the mother needs special medical support and interventions which differ from somatic support in nonpregnant BD patients. Both after a successful delivery and in the case of fetal abortion, the mother can also be considered as an organ donor. In general, we recommend that there be no clear lower limit to the gestational age which would restrict the physician's efforts to support the brain-dead mother and her fetus. A meeting of the neurosurgical, critical care, obstetric, neonatal, transplant and ethical staff, along with the patient's family, should collectively make a decision about future treatment steps. Since currently there are still only a limited number of cases describing the management of extended maternal somatic support after brain death, the current recommendations should be continuously reassessed and adapted along with the growing experience and knowledge. For such serious and rare cases as described here, it would be advisable from a clinical point of view to establish an international registry network of BD pregnant patients, which could help to gather further experience. We also think that from the practical point of view, it would be possible to establish such a registry and this network could become a part of routine clinical usage in all neurosurgery and intensive care centers.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in fetal deaths-United States, 2015–2017 [^1156gYjG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The spontaneous death or loss of a fetus during pregnancy is termed a fetal death. In the United States, national data on fetal deaths are available for losses at ≥ 20 weeks' gestation. * Deaths occurring during this period of pregnancy are commonly known as stillbirths. In 2017, approximately 23,000 fetal deaths were reported in the United States. Racial/ethnic disparities exist in the fetal mortality rate; however, much of the known disparity in fetal deaths is unexplained. CDC analyzed 2015–2017 U.S. fetal death report data and found that non-Hispanic Black (Black) women had more than twice the fetal mortality rate compared with non-Hispanic White (White) women and Hispanic women. Fetal mortality rates also varied by maternal state of residence. Cause of death analyses were conducted for jurisdictions where > 50% of reports had a cause of death specified. Still, even in these jurisdictions, approximately 31% of fetal deaths had no cause of death reported on a fetal death report. There were differences by race and Hispanic origin in causes of death, with Black women having three times the rate of fetal deaths because of maternal complications compared with White women. The disparities suggest opportunities for prevention to reduce the U.S. fetal mortality rate. Improved documentation of cause of death on fetal death reports might help identify preventable causes and guide prevention efforts.

### Baby doe redux? The department of health and human services and the born-alive infants protection act of 2002: a cautionary note on normative neonatal practice [^114emspR]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA), passed by Congress in 2002, has attracted little publicity. Its purposes were, in part, "to repudiate the flawed notion that a child's entitlement to the protections of the law is dependent on whether that child's mother or others want him or her". Understood as antiabortion rhetoric, the bill raised little concern among physicians at the time of legislative hearings and passed in both Houses by overwhelming majorities, hardly suggesting contentious legislation. After its signing into law, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) Steering Committee issued an opinion stating that "[BAIPA] should not in any way affect the approach that physicians currently follow with respect to the extremely premature infant". This interpretation of the law, however, may have been short sighted. In April 2005, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) brought life to the BAIPA, announcing: "As a matter of law and policy, [DHHS] will investigate all circumstances where individuals and entities are reported to be withholding medical care from an infant born alive in potential violation of federal statutes". The agency issued instructions to state officials on how the definitional provision within the BAIPA interacts with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). These interagency memoranda potentially resurrect dormant governmental oversight of newborn-treatment decisions and thus may have influence over normative neonatal practice. Under the BAIPA, the DHHS interprets EMTALA to protect all "born-alive" infants; hospitals and physicians violating regulatory requirements face agency-sanctioned monetary penalties or a "private right of action by any individual harmed as a direct result". According to its memorandum, the DHHS will investigate allegations of EMTALA violations whenever it finds evidence that a newborn was not provided with at least a medical screening examination under circumstances in which a "prudent layperson observer" could conclude from the infant's "appearance or behavior" that it was "suffering from an emergency medical condition". The memorandum fails to clarify which observers qualify as prudent, what infant appearance or behavior is relevant, or what defines an emergency medical condition. Because these evaluative criteria are not constrained by reference to relevant standards of medical care, the agency arguably substitutes a nonprofessional's presumed sagacious assessment of survivability for reasonable medical judgment. Indeed, under a straightforward reading of the instruction, a family member could conceivably trigger an investigation after observing a relative deliver a 20-week fetus who maintains a heartbeat for an hour before its death. Most physicians would not consider this an emergency medical condition and, rather than perform a screening examination, would provide comfort for the newborn and support for the family. The guideline, however, does not state that professional acumen trumps the layperson's observations in these instances; thus, physicians are left unclear about whether screening examinations are required for all newborns regardless of a priori, reasoned considerations of survivability. In this context, the NRP Steering Committee opinion states that "at the time of delivery… the medical condition and prognosis of the newly born infant should be assessed. At that point decisions about withholding or discontinuing medical treatment that is considered futile may be considered by… providers in conjunction with the parents acting in the best interest of their child". However, most pediatricians skilled in screening and resuscitation are not currently called on to perform this function when the gestational age of a nonviable fetus is reasonably certain before delivery. If under the law screening is now required at any gestational age, professional procedure immediately after previable births may need modification. More worrisome, threatened aggressive investigations of alleged EMTALA violations at the soft edges of viability, where futility remains a matter of debate, jeopardize the normative ethical practice of offering discretionary palliative care. The DHHS sent its other instruction to state child protective services agencies responsible for implementing CAPTA regulations; it reiterates the limited situations in which physicians may withhold medical treatment from infants and reemphasizes the local role of "individuals within health care facilities" to notify authorities of suspected infractions. Its real import, however, is insistence on local execution of legal remedies to prevent nontreatment decisions deemed impermissible by the 1984 Baby Doe rules. Because this new directive encourages governmental oversight of treatment decisions involving imperiled newborns, a period of benign regulatory neglect seems to be over. The federal CAPTA rules arguably remove quality-of-life considerations from the decision-making calculus and therefore may conflict with the best-interests paradigm advocated by the American Academy of Pediatrics and NRP. How courts will respond to the DHHS interpretation of EMTALA and CAPTA under the BAIPA remains unclear. Federal courts have yet to authoritatively examine alleged EMTALA violations involving newborn treatment decisions at the limits of viability. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has permitted an EMTALA claim to go to trial where physicians allegedly did not screen or resuscitate a 22-week newborn delivered in an emergency department, and a lower appellate court has relied on CAPTA to hold that parents do not possess the right to choose against resuscitating an extremely premature newborn. The Texas Supreme Court recently granted physicians the paternalistic prerogative to resuscitate imperiled newborns without attention to parental preference under a common law doctrine of "emergent circumstances". These judicial decisions undermine the ethical discretion parents are typically afforded in decision-making before and after delivery in these morally complex situations. The DHHS interpretation of the BAIPA may encourage jurisdictional creep of these kinds of pronouncements as the agency seeks to expand legal protections for born-alive infants. The US Supreme Court has stated that "courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there"; thus, judges interpret law by analyzing "concrete statutory language, not by reference to abstract notions of generalized legislative intent". The BAIPA indiscriminately defines "born alive" to include an infant "at any stage of development… regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion", and it makes no reference to standards of care or best interests, nor does it specifically protect a parent's decision-making authority. Under the law's strict logic, an 18-week miscarried fetus with a detectable heart beat after delivery is entitled to the full protections of the law as determined by "any Act of Congress, or any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies". Before concluding that the BAIPA would not affect normative neonatal practice, the NRP Steering Committee should have analyzed the act's actual statutory language and avoided relying heavily on imprecise legislative intent. The BAIPA's congressional sponsors did claim that the law "will not mandate medical treatment where none is currently indicated", but such political rhetoric is often not sufficient to render law innocuous years after separation from its legislative history. Besides, nowhere in the House record does the majority explicitly acknowledge that discretion to decide the fate of imperiled newborns invests in parents, in consultation with physicians; indeed, the bill's stated purpose was to repudiate that notion. At best, legislators recognized that physicians disagree about the efficacy of resuscitating at the limits of viability, and therefore the current standard of care permits doctors to deem resuscitation a futile endeavor. However, judges may resist characterizing resuscitation as futile, given its poor analytical fit, and substantial public-policy concerns regarding discrimination against future disabled individuals could easily tip a court to preserve incipient, at least, physiologic life under the BAIPA's all-encompassing definition of born alive.

### Underreporting of stillbirths in Pakistan: perspectives of the parents, community and healthcare providers [^114dv4KT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Indigenous terminology and understanding about stillbirth

The terminology used for stillbirth varies by sociocultural milieu among the regions in Pakistan. The data analysis demonstrated that the meaning of stillbirth was unclear and vague to the parents, community and healthcare providers. Labelling the reality by a local word may not be the issue, but it becomes a matter of concern by the virtue of connotations attached to it. The parents and families not only had a misplaced understanding of the concept of stillbirth, but the healthcare providers also wrongly defined and, thus, erroneously classified it in a certain category. Most of the time, for example, they were unclear about the difference between miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, which resulted consequently in the underreporting of the cases of stillbirth. Hence, stakeholders were asked to clarify the meanings of stillbirth to assess the validity of reporting.

Male and female participants of FGDs exhibited a deficient understanding about stillbirth. Of the 14 FGDs conducted, there were only two such discussions where the participants defined the concept of stillbirth correctly. It is also significant to note that there were no marked differences between the knowledge of male and female FGD participants regarding stillbirths. In addition, the discussion about stillbirths was judged as useless:

Why are you people wasting time discussing things which are not in our hands? If a fetus dies in the abdomen of mother, who knows the cause? Who knows the time? It is by the will of Allah. He knows better.

In addition, male and female participants during the FGD used the word batcha for a fetus whether it was dead or alive. The place of batcha in the uterus was also culturally defined and understood; some mothers thought that the batcha is positioned somewhere in the abdomen, while others considered it was in the bitcha-e-dani (the lower abdomen/uterus). Keeping such folk anatomy in mind, women were advised to drink hot milk with ghee (butter with the fat removed) so that a slippery situation in the bitcha-e-dani facilitates the delivery. Any action of women which deviates from such cultural understanding was considered to be a cause of stillbirth. Thus, we found that a lack of understanding about stillbirth was augmented because of inconsistent terminologies (a wide gap between biomedical and local terminologies).

### Fetal death: expert consensus of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^115ruogL]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

6.4 External examination and autopsy

It is recommended that external examination of the fetus should be systematically offered in cases of fetal death. The external examination should preferably be performed in the delivery room by a fetopathologist or, if this is not possible, another health professional, using a standardized form. If there is any doubt about the sex of the fetus, it is recommended that this not be recorded on the birth certificate, but instead await the results of any fetopathologic or genetic examination (expert opinion).

Fetopathologic examination is among the most important tests in determining the cause of fetal death. In a 2017 multicenter retrospective study of 512 fetal deaths after 20 weeks GA in the US, fetopathologic examination was considered second only to placental examination for diagnosing the cause of fetal death, and was considered most useful in 42.4% of cases (217/512; 95% CI: 36.9–48.4) (33). Its diagnostic value was greater in cases of suspected antenatal fetal anomalies (90.3%; 95% CI: 60.0%–100%) and intrauterine growth retardation (79.2%; 95% CI: 57.1%–100%) than in cases of, for example, intrauterine infection (44.2%; 95% CI: 30.6%–61.7%). Thus, it is recommended that a fetopathologic examination be performed to help determine the cause of death (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence).

6.5 Placental examination

A systematic review by Ptacek et al. including 13 studies (3636 fetal deaths), found that placental lesions could explain fetal death in 11.2%–64.6% of cases. In a 2012 Dutch multicenter prospective study that included 1025 fetal deaths after 20 weeks GA, the placental examination was abnormal in 89.2% of cases (903/1012; 95% CI: 87.2%–91%), and 65.2% of fetal deaths were attributed to a placental cause. Most common were abnormalities of the basal plate (placental malperfusion of maternal origin), villous development, and umbilical cord defects. Therefore, placental pathology is recommended to determine the cause (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence).

### Viability and thresholds for treatment of extremely preterm infants: survey of UK neonatal professionals [^115WnzrX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The upper threshold

Almost two-thirds of respondents selected 23 +6 /24 +0 weeks as their upper threshold. This is unchanged from UK doctors in 2016. It is similar, but slightly lower than studies from other high-income countries where participants identified the upper threshold as a point between 24 +0 and 25 +6 weeks. The lack of change in the upper threshold implies that the grey zone in the UK has widened rather than simply shifted downwards in gestation. This could reflect the greater emphasis in the revised BAPM framework on factors other than just gestational age.

Understanding of viability

Survey participants understood viability similarly to neonatologists and obstetricians in a recent survey from Victoria, Australiawith respect to the possibility of survival at a given gestation, regardless of disability, with the use of medical interventions accessible to the treating team. A minority of clinicians in both surveys indicated that viability depended on survival without disability.

Most respondents agreed that the gestation at which a fetus is considered viable has changed in the last decade, and that neonatal care advances have changed how they feel about Active Treatment for EPIs. There was ambivalence regarding whether these advances impacted on how participants felt about Palliative Care at the same gestation. These views are consistent with the change and lack of change, respectively, in lower and upper thresholds described above.

Two questions related to abortion. In our survey, there was no consensus among respondents; almost equal proportions agreed and disagreed that improvements in neonatal care influenced their views on abortion, or that law should change. This contrasts somewhat with results from the aforementioned Australian survey, in which obstetricians and neonatologists were more likely to disagree with both statements.

### A much valued tool that also brings ethical dilemmas-a qualitative study of Norwegian midwives' experiences and views on the role of obstetric ultrasound [^116p46r6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

'The media and the technological development have been a part of creating a different view of the fetus, and all these 3D and 4D [ultrasound examinations], make them very baby-like. We too have a poster [at the fetal medicine unit], that in a way personifies the fetus very much with its personality traits, you know'. (FGD 4)

Midwives reported witnessing expectant parents starting to plan for things to buy for their "child" as soon as they saw the fetus on the ultrasound screen. This could also be considered very challenging especially when there were signs of fetal complications. One midwife described sometimes wanting to tone down expectant parents' joy and conversation about plans for their "child".

'If you see that there are twins and they are in the same sack, then you think "please help" [how to convey that it is a high risk pregnancy]. And then you say that there are twins, and then [the expectant parents might say] "Oh! What pram shall we buy?" And you think, "Will these twins be born [alive]?"'. (FGD 4)

It was suggested also that ultrasound could be used to enhance women's bonding to the fetus in specific situations, such as when pregnant women used drugs or had psychiatric problems.

'I work with those in more difficult situations, such as drug abuse, or psychiatric and psychosocial issues. We use ultrasound as part of their interaction with the baby and it is a very good way to use ultrasound, to show the baby and to study a little how the parents behave when they see their baby in the uterus. And that's a very important part because it provides an early connection and interaction with the baby '. (FGD 5)

Health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits of each strategy in a given clinical scenario and consider available institutional expertise, and shared decision making plays an important role in determining the optimal method for delivery in the setting of fetal demise. The results of the autopsy, placental examination, laboratory tests, and cytogenetic studies should be communicated to the involved clinicians and to the family of the deceased infant in a timely manner, and bereavement care should be individualized to recognize bereaved parents' personal, cultural or religious needs.

### Babies born at the threshold of viability: changes in survival and workload over 20 years [^115rjiLJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

So what implications do these data have for the various issues surrounding this group of babies and are the current management guidelines appropriate both in the UK and in other countries with similar approaches to these babies? In relation to babies born at 24 and 25 weeks of gestation, survival to discharge for babies was approximately 44% and 67%, respectively in the most recent 5 years, and given that late deaths are not common, it would seem unacceptable to consider anything other than an expectation of active treatment for such babies. Perhaps more important is that the trend in the data over time is for improvement. This suggests that current technologies are improving the outlook for these babies and hence it would seem perverse not to consider an active approach in such babies as the norm.

For babies born at 22 weeks of gestation, the opposite appears to be true as no survivors were recorded. The only trend in the data appears to be a steady reduction in the number of babies even considered for intensive care. The number of CPAP and ventilation days received by the 22 weeks gestational age babies reflected the care pathway of a very small number of babies who all ultimately died. A palliative approach to the baby and his or her family therefore seems appropriate in terms of what current technology appears to be able to offer but this position should be subject to review if the outcome for 23-week gestation babies was to change significantly in the future.

The situation regarding babies of 23 weeks gestation presents the most complex challenge. In relation to the link with the abortion limit, the study includes data to support the view that 23 weeks represents the limit of our current technology and that this situation has not shown significant change over 20 years.

The current clinical guidelines regarding the management of babies born at 23 weeks of gestation suggest that the decision to offer active treatment should be made jointly between the clinical team and the parents with the expectation that for many babies active intervention would not be appropriate. Clearly a range of factors impact on what actually happens such as the time available for counselling and discussion, the experience of the clinicians present, the understanding and background of the parents and the condition of the baby when born. Given that some key elements of the process cannot easily be controlled, in many cases attempting resuscitation is the 'default' position. It is this issue which has been the subject of media debate and whether, as in The Netherlands, at 23 weeks of gestation, resuscitation should not be attempted.

Follow-up studies are required to see long-term effects of neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2.

### The fetus in the age of the genome [^116zFc3u]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to a number of recent achievements, the field of prenatal medicine is now on the verge of a profound transformation into prenatal genomic medicine. This transformation is expected to not only substantially expand the spectrum of prenatal diagnostic and screening possibilities, but finally also to advance fetal care and the prenatal management of certain fetal diseases and malformations. It will come along with new and profound challenges for the normative framework and clinical care pathways in prenatal (and reproductive) medicine. To adequately address the potential ethically challenging aspects without discarding the obvious benefits, several agents are required to engage in different debates. The permissibility of the sequencing of the whole fetal exome or genome will have to be examined from a philosophical and legal point of view, in particular with regard to conflicts with potential rights of future children. A second requirement is a societal debate on the question of priority setting and justice in relation to prenatal genomic testing. Third, a professional-ethical debate and positioning on the goal of prenatal genomic testing and a consequential re-structuring of clinical care pathways seems to be important. In all these efforts, it might be helpful to envisage the unborn rather not as a fetus, not as a separate moral subject and a second "patient", but in its unique physical connection with the pregnant woman, and to accept the moral quandaries implicitly given in this situation.

### One life ends, another begins: management of a brain-dead pregnant mother – A systematic review- [^1112SqXt]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Ethical and legal issues

Many ethical and legal questions arise in cases of maternal BD. Although it was not the focus of this review, we briefly discussed various aspects of ethical and legal issues such as "the mother's body as a cadaveric incubator", "mother as the organ donor and fetus as the recipient" and the concern for "possible damages to the fetus". Some professionals believe that it is not ethically acceptable to maintain the mother's body after BD to use it as a "fetal container". Such a decision should not be simply assumed, but it must be debated. If the mother is to be considered a "cadaveric incubator" with no autonomous rights, the rights of the fetus should legally prevail. Another argument claims that the prolonged somatic support itself is actually organ donation with the fetus as the recipient. In that case, if the mother had previously indicated a wish to donate her organs, it would be appropriate to proceed with the extended somatic support. Finally, some believe that strategies used to maintain maternal somatic function are still in the experimental stage. Not every adverse effect of medication used on the fetus during an extended somatic support is known. The next of kin must therefore be informed about the existing life maintenance strategies and the possible damages they may cause to the fetus. Psychological consultation should certainly be beneficial in this situation.

Since such catastrophic cases are so infrequent, the mother's wish is in effect rarely known. For this reason, it is strongly suggested to engage the family in the planning of the care. The physician and transplant coordinator should not impose all available procedures against the wishes of the family. Sperling et al. suggested that questions be answered on a case-by-case basis with the involvement of the hospital's ethics committee. One also needs to consider that while nowadays somatic support in the case of maternal BD is technically possible, there is still no legal document which asks a pregnant woman about the fate of her unborn child in the event of BD. It is highly recommended that this question be added to the advance directives of any woman of childbearing age and routinely discussed in standard prenatal interviews.

### Reviewing the womb [^116HKyaH]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

There is an urgent need to avoid perceptions of the womb as a site of conflict, in order to ensure that pregnant women's bodies are not treated as a dangerous environment for the fetus, rather than an essential part of the maternal–fetal unit. Pregnant women's interests and autonomous choices must not be erased and ignored in favour of promoting fetal well-being, and the conflict view of the maternal–fetal unit seems to play a crucial role in this framing. In the next two sections, we present the notion of maternal–fetal conflict as it is often used in the ethical and legal literature, and demonstrate why this notion is unsubstantiated, incoherent and possibly dangerous, and should therefore be rejected.

### Abnormal fetal growth: small for gestational age, fetal growth restriction, large for gestational age: definitions and epidemiology [^115CRdAi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abnormal fetal growth (growth restriction and overgrowth) is associated with perinatal morbidity, mortality, and lifelong risks to health. To describe abnormal growth, "small for gestational age" and "large for gestational age" are commonly used terms. However, both are statistical definitions of fetal size below or above a certain threshold related to a reference population, rather than referring to an abnormal condition. Fetuses can be constitutionally small or large and thus healthy, whereas fetuses with seemingly normal size can be growth restricted or overgrown. Although golden standards to detect abnormal growth are lacking, understanding of both pathologic conditions has improved significantly.

### Does advanced maternal age confer a survival advantage to infants born at early gestation? [^117HYXxQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our study demonstrates that contrasts of traditional gestational age-specific perinatal mortality rates among older versus younger mothers result in the intersecting perinatal mortality curves. The traditional perinatal model provides a varying prognostic perspective on the effect of older maternal age, with protection against neonatal/perinatal death observed at early gestation and an increased risk of neonatal/perinatal death observed at later gestation. On the other hand, the fetuses-at-risk model provides a consistent causal perspective on the effect of older maternal age, with an increased risk of fetal, neonatal and perinatal death observed at all gestational ages. This underscores the need for a proper conceptualization of gestational age-specific perinatal mortality in studies examining causal associations.

### Fetal outcome in the critically ill pregnant woman [^11361H7o]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of the critically ill pregnant patient is complicated by the presence of the fetus. The fetus is at risk from the effects of the maternal illness as well as from the effects of critical care interventions. Altering maternal care to protect the fetus (for example, avoiding certain drugs or radiological investigations) may have deleterious effects on both mother and fetus. Limited data exist to identify fetal risk factors in critically ill mothers admitted to the ICU. This article reviews the potential adverse effects of maternal critical illness on the fetus, as well as the limited data available to predict fetal outcome. We provide data from a secondary analysis of a database of critically ill pregnant women. The potential dilemma of termination of pregnancy to improve maternal well-being is also addressed.

### Prenatal gene editing for neurodevelopmental diseases: ethical considerations [^117SNBcZ]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical prenatal intervention guidelines that reference heritable risks do not deem them universally unacceptable — rather, they stress the importance of minimizing them (Table S1). In proposed cases of prenatal somatic cell editing, a fetus would be far enough along in development to be diagnosed with a disorder, so interventions would be intended to treat a condition by targeting the affected tissue or tissues. Pregnant people carrying a fetus who choose to undergo an intervention would be doing so with the intended goal of treating the disease in utero and carrying the fetus to term. This decision confers an interest in the fetus's health along with that of the pregnant person that may support a risky prenatal somatic cell editing intervention if the fetus stands to greatly benefit from it. If a prenatal gene editing treatment only targets somatic cells as intended, then the human born may have no disease symptoms but could ultimately pass the disease on to their progeny via uncorrected mutations in their germ cells. If germline cells are incidentally edited in the fetus or pregnant person in the pursuit of editing somatic cells to treat disease, then this risk may be considered acceptable. If germline cell edits are on-target, then this could even be viewed as a benefit — the disease could essentially be eradicated from the progeny's genome, resulting in heritable gene editing that prevents future generations from getting the disease as well. However, if germline cell edits are off-target, then this could have negative impacts on fertility, complicating the acceptability of this risk.
(12) The benefits of the treatment should outweigh the risks and be considered both independently and jointly for the pregnant person and the fetus.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in fetal deaths-United States, 2015–2017 [^1146Uhvd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The spontaneous death or loss of a fetus during pregnancy is termed a fetal death. In the United States, national data on fetal deaths are available for losses at ≥ 20 weeks' gestation.* Deaths occurring during this period of pregnancy are commonly known as stillbirths. In 2017, approximately 23,000 fetal deaths were reported in the United States (1). Racial/ethnic disparities exist in the fetal mortality rate; however, much of the known disparity in fetal deaths is unexplained (2). CDC analyzed 2015–2017 U.S. fetal death report data and found that non-Hispanic Black (Black) women had more than twice the fetal mortality rate compared with non-Hispanic White (White) women and Hispanic women. Fetal mortality rates also varied by maternal state of residence. Cause of death analyses were conducted for jurisdictions where > 50% of reports had a cause of death specified. Still, even in these jurisdictions, approximately 31% of fetal deaths had no cause of death reported on a fetal death report. There were differences by race and Hispanic origin in causes of death, with Black women having three times the rate of fetal deaths because of maternal complications compared with White women. The disparities suggest opportunities for prevention to reduce the U.S. fetal mortality rate. Improved documentation of cause of death on fetal death reports might help identify preventable causes and guide prevention efforts.

### 3.2 million stillbirths: epidemiology and overview of the evidence review [^1148HdG6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Barriers to recording and reducing stillbirths

While the world's neonatal deaths have received increasing global attention in recent years, stillbirths have remained virtually invisible to policymakers and funding agencies despite the fact that stillbirths have many common risk factors with neonatal deaths and maternal deaths, both of which are centrally placed in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Stillbirth data are not tracked in the MDG indicators or included in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) annual World Health Report, although they will be included in the mortality tables of the next version of the Global Burden of Disease. There are many reasons for this policy invisibility, but important reasons include the lack of consistency in defining stillbirths and lack of systematic data on the rates and numbers, and especially systematic estimates for specific causes of stillbirths. Socio-cultural barriers to recognition and reporting of stillbirths play an important role, both in limited data collection but also in mobilising civil society attention. In contrast to the public outcry and street demonstrations demanding treatment that have been observed in the case of HIV, families may not even discuss intrapartum stillbirths even though these are eminently preventable.

Lack of clarity and consistency in definitions

Recognition of stillbirths as a public health concern is hampered by confusion and inconsistent application of definitions. The messages to policymakers and civil society regarding the size of the problem are complex and inconsistent, even for the basic definition of stillbirth. Multiple definitions are in use in different settings based on different parameters including birth weight (350, 500 or 1000 g), and/or body length or gestational age. The minimum gestational age defining a stillbirth may vary from 20 to 28 weeks of gestation. This cut-off is generally earlier in high-income countries than in low-/middle-income countries based on standards of viability. For international comparability, the WHO recommends the inclusion of all infants born dead and weighing 1000 g or more at birth (if birth weight is available), or after 28 completed weeks of gestation, or attainment of 35 cm crown-heel length. Here we will use the colloquial term, stillbirth, to refer to both early and late fetal deaths; but it should be noted that the international comparison data for stillbirth rates refer only to late fetal deaths (over 1000 g or 28 weeks gestation). We also note that the weight and gestational equivalents are approximate and some measurement bias is introduced by considering these to be equivalent.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^111ib3g6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Recommendations for reporting of perinatal events

All births, both live and stillborn, and deaths can be categorized by period of gestation and birth weight for reporting purposes. Neonatal deaths can also be categorized by chronological age.

Categorization by period of gestation

Gestational age is used to define maturity: preterm (< 37 +0 weeks, < 259 days), term (37 +0 to 41 +6 weeks, 259–293 days), and post‐term (≥ 42 +0 weeks, ≥ 294 days). Preterm births can be further subgrouped as peri‐viable, extremely, very, moderate and late preterm (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Classification of births by period of gestation. Where the peri‐viable category is used the lower gestational limit for inclusion should be specified.

Categorization by birth weight

For birth weight reporting of fetal deaths under 22 weeks, stillbirth and neonatal mortality statistics intervals of 500 g should be used, that is, ≤ 499; 500–999; 1000–1499; 1500–1999; 2000–2499; 2500–2999; 3000–3499; 3500–3999; 4000–4499; 4500–4999; and ≥ 5000 g (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Classification of births by birth weight. Low birth weight (LBW) and high birth weight can be further categorized into "extremely" and "very" subcategories. As these terms are not mutually exclusive, reporting using the 500 g intervals as above is recommended.

Categorization by chronological age

Neonatal deaths can be further categorized by chronological timing since birth. Definitions of early and late neonatal deaths are given above. For mortality statistics, reporting by single days is recommended for the first week of life (days 0–6), and then by week (week 2 [7–13 days], week 3 [14–20 days], week 4 [21–27 days]). Additionally, where possible, grouping day 0 deaths into < 1, 1–11 and 12–23 h is recommended.

### Preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22–25 weeks' gestation: perinatal and 2-year outcomes within a national population-based study (EPIPAGE-2) [^1166jhYE]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most clinical guidelines state that with early preterm premature rupture of membranes, obstetric and pediatric teams must share a realistic and individualized appraisal of neonatal outcomes with parents and consider their wishes for all decisions. However, we currently lack reliable and relevant data, according to gestational age at rupture of membranes, to adequately counsel parents during pregnancy and to reflect on our policies of care at these extreme gestational ages.

Objective

We sought to describe both perinatal and 2-year outcomes of preterm infants born after preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22–25 weeks' gestation.

Study Design

EPIPAGE-2 is a French national prospective population-based cohort of preterm infants born in 546 maternity units in 2011. Inclusion criteria in this analysis were women diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22–25 weeks' gestation and singleton or twin gestations with fetus(es) alive at rupture of membranes. Latency duration, antenatal management, and outcomes (survival at discharge, survival at discharge without severe morbidity, and survival at 2 years' corrected age without cerebral palsy) were described and compared by gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes.

Results

Among the 1435 women with a diagnosis of preterm premature rupture of membranes, 379 were at 22–25 weeks' gestation, with 427 fetuses (331 singletons and 96 twins). Median gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes and at birth were 24 (interquartile range 23–25) and 25 (24–27) weeks, respectively. For each gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes, nearly half of the fetuses were born within the week after the rupture of membranes. Among the 427 fetuses, 51.7% were survivors at discharge (14.1%, 39.5%, 66.8%, and 75.8% with preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22, 23, 24, and 25 weeks, respectively), 38.8% were survivors at discharge without severe morbidity, and 46.4% were survivors at 2 years without cerebral palsy, with wide variations by gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes. Survival at 2 years without cerebral palsy was low with preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22 and 23 weeks but reached approximately 60% and 70% with preterm premature rupture of membranes at 24 and 25 weeks.

Conclusion

Preterm premature rupture of membranes at 22–25 weeks is associated with high incidence of mortality and morbidity, with wide variations by gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes. However, a nonnegligible proportion of children survive without severe morbidity both at discharge and at 2 years' corrected age.

### Global, regional, and national stillbirths at 20 weeks' gestation or longer in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^114Ru8v5]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Stillbirth and miscarriage are defined as fetal loss before or during delivery, and their primary differentiation is gestational age at the end of pregnancy; both are differentiated from abortion by intentionality. Conceptually, threshold definitions used for stillbirth data collection should allow for all pregnancy losses to be counted in a comparable manner, but unfortunately this has not historically been the case. WHO has articulated that 28 weeks or longer of completed gestation (or, if information on gestational age is not available, ≥ 1000 g in birthweight) is the only threshold of stillbirth that should be tracked for international comparison. This threshold definition contrasts with that of the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10), which proposes a stillbirth threshold definition of 20 weeks' gestation or longer, and the more recent ICD-11, which defines stillbirths as fetal deaths at 22 weeks of completed gestation or longer (or, if information on gestational age is not available, ≥ 500 g birthweight). Although only reporting on fetal deaths at 28 weeks' completed gestation or longer and counting gestational age and birthweight as equivalent stillbirth criteria might be considered pragmatic, this functionally means all fetal deaths occurring between 20 weeks and less than 28 weeks are left uncounted, creates potential comparability issues in allowing for interchange between birthweight and gestational age, and actively ignores the large volume of data that are available to generate complete and comprehensive estimates of all pregnancy losses. Although the ICD-11 definition might more appropriately reflect the limits of extrauterine viability, the reality is that it will be quite some time before ICD-11 supplants ICD-10 as the primary method of data collection and reporting. In this setting, the most appropriate approach to ensure no unintentional pregnancy losses are missed is a gestational age threshold of 20 weeks or longer, as has been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and more than 30 other countries and territories in reporting stillbirths.

2.7 Reporting criteria for international comparisons

Inclusion of fetal deaths and live births born at extremely low gestational ages disrupts the validity of international comparisons and is therefore not recommended.

For international comparisons countries should report all late gestation stillbirths (≥ 196 days [≥ 28 +0 weeks] or birth weight ≥ 1000 g, if gestational age unknown). Where possible, additionally report early gestation stillbirths (154–195 days [22 +0–27 +6 weeks] or birth weight 500–999 g, if gestational age unknown) as a separate category (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Recommendations for internationally comparable reporting of perinatal death statistics.

Whilst all neonatal deaths should be reported in the national data system, for international comparisons only those born ≥ 196 days (≥ 28 +0 weeks or birth weight ≥ 1000 g, if gestational age unknown) should be included. This recommendation represents a shift from previous recommendations and current practice in many countries. However, gestational age and birth weight should now be recorded for every birth and death, and national reporting systems should be adapted to facilitate reporting using these thresholds.

Where deaths before 154 days (< 22 +0 weeks or < 500 g, if gestational age unknown) are included in perinatal statistics they should be presented separately from deaths at 154 days or more (≥ 22 +0 weeks or < 500 g, if gestational age unknown) and the lower limit for inclusion in perinatal statistics in the setting should be stated, for example, "20 +0 weeks of gestation" or "no lower gestational age limit".

Indicators for international comparisons of perinatal mortality

To facilitate international comparisons, ICD‐11 recommends reporting the following rates:
Late gestation stillbirth rate = ([stillbirths ≥ 28 +0 weeks]/[total births ≥ 28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Early neonatal mortality rate = ([day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥ 28 +0 weeks]/[live births born at ≥ 28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Perinatal mortality rate = ([stillbirths ≥ 28 +0 weeks + day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥ 28 +0 weeks] /[total births ≥ 28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.

A shared decision-making model — key components and definitions include deliberation (a process where patients become aware of choice, understand options, and have time and support to consider 'what matters most to them'), choice talk (conveys awareness that a choice exists, initiated by either a patient or a clinician, possibly before the clinical encounter), option talk (patients are informed about treatment options in more detail), and decision talk (patients are supported to explore 'what matters most to them', having become informed). Decision support is designed in two formats: 1) brief enough to be used by clinician and patient together and 2) more extensive, designed to be used by patients either before or after clinical encounters (paper, DVD, web). Awareness of options leads to the development of initial preferences, with the goal to arrive at informed preferences; informed preferences are personal preferences based on 'what matters most to patients', predicated on an understanding of the most relevant benefits and harms.

ACOG/SMFM Obstetric Care Consensus #10 — stillbirth evaluation and genetic testing recommendations state that evaluation of a stillbirth should include fetal autopsy; gross and histologic examination of the placenta, umbilical cord, and membranes; and genetic evaluation. Gross and microscopic examination of the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal membranes by a trained pathologist is the single most useful aspect of the evaluation of stillbirth and is an essential component of the evaluation. Microarray analysis, incorporated into the stillbirth workup, improves the test success rate and the detection of genetic anomalies compared with conventional karyotyping, and genetic analyses are of sufficient yield that they should be performed in all cases of stillbirth after appropriate parental permission is obtained. In women who decline invasive testing, a portion of the placenta, an umbilical cord segment, or internal fetal tissue can be sent for genetic analysis, whereas inherited thrombophilias have not been associated with stillbirth, and testing for them as part of a stillbirth evaluation is not recommended. The general examination of the stillborn fetus should be done promptly, noting any dysmorphic features and obtaining measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, and genetic evaluation for specific abnormalities should be guided by the clinical history and detected fetal abnormalities. For patients with a previous stillbirth at or after 32 0/7 weeks, once- or twice-weekly antenatal surveillance is recommended at 32 0/7 weeks or starting at 1–2 weeks before the gestational age of the previous stillbirth, and for stillbirth that occurred before 32 0/7 weeks of gestation, individualized timing of antenatal surveillance may be considered.

Objectives

To explore international differences in the classification of births at extremely low gestation and the subsequent impact on the calculation of survival rates.

Methods

We used national data on births at 22 to 25 weeks' gestation from the United States (2014; n = 11144), Canada (2009–2014; n = 5668), the United Kingdom (2014–2015; n = 2992), Norway (2010–2014; n = 409), Finland (2010–2015; n = 348), Sweden (2011–2014; n = 489), and Japan (2014–2015; n = 2288) to compare neonatal survival rates using different denominators: all births, births alive at the onset of labor, live births, live births surviving to 1 hour, and live births surviving to 24 hours.

Results

For births at 22 weeks' gestation, neonatal survival rates for which we used live births as the denominator varied from 3.7% to 56.7% among the 7 countries. This variation decreased when the denominator was changed to include stillbirths (ie, all births [1.8%-22.3%] and fetuses alive at the onset of labor [3.7%-38.2%]) or exclude early deaths and limited to births surviving at least 12 hours (50.0%-77.8%). Similar trends were seen for infants born at 23 weeks' gestation. Variation diminished considerably at 24 and 25 weeks' gestation.

Conclusions

International variation in neonatal survival rates at 22 to 23 weeks' gestation diminished considerably when including stillbirths in the denominator, revealing the variation arises in part from differences in the proportion of births reported as live births, which itself is closely connected to the provision of active care.

Examination of the stillborn fetus — procedures and options: The general examination of the stillborn fetus should be done promptly, noting any dysmorphic features and obtaining measurements of weight, length, and head circumference, and foot length may be especially useful before 23 weeks of gestation to ascertain gestational age. Photographs of the whole body and close-up views are vital for subsequent review, and whole-body X-ray with anterior–posterior and lateral views may reveal an unrecognized skeletal abnormality or further define a grossly apparent deformity. Fetal autopsy should be offered because it is one of the most useful diagnostic tests in determining the cause of death, and if families are uncomfortable with a complete autopsy, other options such as partial autopsy, gross examination by a trained pathologist, ultrasonography, and especially magnetic resonance imaging are particularly useful. When a full autopsy is performed, it should follow published guidelines and protocols for perinatal autopsy; recommendations include measurements to establish gestational age (such as foot length and body weight), estimation of the interval between death and delivery, identification of intrinsic abnormalities and developmental disorders, and investigation for evidence of infection, and it is preferable to use a pathologist experienced in perinatal autopsy with examination by a physician experienced in genetics and dysmorphology.

Definitions Challenges in consistent definitions of fetal and infant death mostly stem from the perception of viability, which should not change the definition of the event. In other words, an extremely preterm infant born at 16 weeks' gestation may be defined as a live birth but is not currently viable outside of the womb. On the basis of international standards set by the World Health Organization, 7 the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines live birth, fetal death, infant death, and perinatal death as follows.
4. Fetal Death A fetus is defined from 8 weeks after conception until term while in the uterus. Fetal death is defined as death before the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy that is not an induced termination of pregnancy.

The death is indicated by the fact that, after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Infant Death A live birth that results in death within the first year is defined as an infant death. Infant deaths are characterized as neonatal and further subdivided into early neonatal, late neonatal, or postneonatal. Close modal In the circumstance of delivery events in which the fetus is of uncertain viability, if the infant is determined to be a live birth, the event is reported regardless of birth weight, length of gestation, survival time, or other clinical information. If fetal death is determined, the event is reported by the obstetric health care provider on the basis of state criteria, including both birth weight and gestational age.

Fetal death: Death before the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy that is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that, after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.
