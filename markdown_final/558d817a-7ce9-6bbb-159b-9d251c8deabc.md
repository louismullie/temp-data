## Question

treatment guidelines for aspiration pneumonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment guidelines for aspiration pneumonitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and distinguishing aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration pneumonia. Then, I should verify the core principle that antibiotics are not indicated for sterile chemical pneumonitis. Next, I will review supportive care measures, including oxygenation, airway management, and bronchoscopy. After that, I need to check whether corticosteroids or prophylactic antibiotics help or harm. Then, I will consider how to monitor for secondary infection and when to start antibiotics if pneumonia develops. Finally, I should integrate prevention strategies and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guideline-grade evidence and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and why it matters therapeutically. Aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury to the lung parenchyma from gastric contents, typically sterile at onset, and often resolves within 24–48 hours with supportive care. In contrast, aspiration pneumonia is an infectious process requiring antibiotics, and conflating the two leads to overtreatment, so I need to keep them separate in my mind and in my orders [^c8ffc922] [^c802af1c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should verify the core principle. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message: antibiotics are not indicated for aspiration pneumonitis itself because it is a sterile chemical injury, and giving prophylactic antibiotics does not improve mortality or reduce critical care transfers, while it does increase antibiotic exposure and downstream escalation, so I should avoid reflex antibiotics here [^c8ffc922] [^880eef48] [^c802af1c].

> Next, I should review supportive care and make sure I am not missing anything. Adequate oxygenation to maintain SpO2 ≥ 92–95%, judicious use of noninvasive ventilation when indicated, and early mobilization with physiotherapy to prevent atelectasis and sputum retention are foundational. I need to ensure hydration status is optimized and consider thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated, aligning with BTS statements on supportive care in aspiration syndromes [^4d66d773] [^fe77df48] [^d087e18a] [^0ac304ec] [^a40e5126] [^7d150f25].

> I will now examine airway and secretion management. Intubation should be selective rather than routine. If there is particulate aspiration or severe hypoxemia, early bronchoscopy can both clear debris and provide lower respiratory tract sampling to distinguish pneumonitis from evolving pneumonia, which I should consider especially in ICU or high-risk settings [^c802af1c] [^2034fedf] [^5d990318].

> Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroids because I recall older narratives suggesting benefit. The balance of evidence and contemporary guidance indicate corticosteroids are not indicated for aspiration pneumonitis; they do not improve outcomes and may carry harm, so I should not order them routinely for chemical pneumonitis [^c802af1c] [^3361b7fb].

> I should double-check how to monitor for secondary infection and define a trigger for antibiotics. Close observation for fever, rising WBC, new focal consolidation, or clinical deterioration beyond 48–72 hours should prompt reassessment. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected or confirmed, then antibiotics are appropriate, ideally guided by cultures or local epidemiology, and I should remember that anaerobic coverage is not routinely required unless there is abscess or empyema, per ATS/IDSA CAP guidance [^c8ffc922] [^11d26a39] [^d66ad209].

> Let me consider prevention and risk mitigation, because reducing recurrence changes the long-term trajectory. Early speech-language therapy evaluation for dysphagia, oral hygiene protocols including twice-daily brushing of teeth, tongue, and palate, and head-of-bed elevation to 30–45 degrees are practical steps with guideline support. In patients with high aspiration risk and feeding intolerance, postpyloric feeding can be considered, and in select post-stroke populations, ACE inhibitors may reduce aspiration pneumonia risk, though evidence is ethnicity-specific and should be individualized [^078d7e4f] [^a0a40b45] [^79e17576] [^6a844918] [^10bea8bd] [^40c7ac16].

> But wait, what if the aspiration event occurred in a fed ICU patient or involved enteric contents beyond the stomach. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Even in those contexts, the initial insult is chemical, and routine prophylactic antibiotics still do not help; if infection evolves, I should treat as pneumonia using standard CAP regimens and avoid reflex anaerobic coverage unless clinical features suggest anaerobic disease, consistent with modern CAP guidance and stewardship principles [^c8ffc922] [^5d990318].

> I should confirm duration and de-escalation principles if antibiotics are ultimately needed. For aspiration pneumonia, a 5-day course is generally sufficient unless there is slow response or complications, and I should narrow therapy based on cultures or clinical trajectory to minimize harm from overtreatment, aligning with BTS statements and broader pneumonia stewardship frameworks [^d1db82e7] [^2760ae47].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each element. First, identify aspiration pneumonitis and exclude infection at the bedside using history, exam, and early imaging. Second, provide supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and physiotherapy. Third, avoid antibiotics and corticosteroids. Fourth, monitor closely for 48–72 hours for evolution to pneumonia. Fifth, if infection is suspected or confirmed, start guideline-concordant antibiotics without routine anaerobic coverage unless indicated. Sixth, implement prevention strategies including dysphagia assessment, oral care, and aspiration precautions. This algorithm aligns with ATS/IDSA CAP guidance, BTS statements, and key studies showing no benefit from prophylactic antibiotics in aspiration pneumonitis [^c8ffc922] [^d1db82e7] [^880eef48].

---

Aspiration pneumonitis is best managed with **supportive care only** [^c8ffc922], including oxygen, airway protection, and hemodynamic support [^c802af1c]; **antibiotics are not indicated** unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed [^880eef48] [^c802af1c]. Corticosteroids are not recommended [^c802af1c] [^3361b7fb], and routine bronchoscopy is not required unless there is large-volume particulate aspiration or persistent hypoxia [^notfound]. Monitor closely for 24–48 hours for clinical deterioration or new infiltrates, and start antibiotics only if infection is suspected or confirmed [^c8ffc922] [^c802af1c].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Acute dyspnea, hypoxemia, bronchospasm, and radiographic infiltrates in dependent lung segments (right lower lobe most common) [^e42b7976].

- **Differentiation**: Distinguish from aspiration pneumonia (infectious) by the absence of fever, leukocytosis, or purulent sputum initially [^notfound].

- **Risk factors**: Reduced consciousness, dysphagia, GERD, enteral feeding, and recent anesthesia or sedation [^9cec380a] [^e42b7976].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of management, with **oxygenation** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% and escalate to noninvasive or invasive ventilation as needed [^4d66d773] [^c802af1c]. Ensure **airway protection** with head-of-bed elevation ≥ 30°, suctioning, and consider intubation for severe hypoxia or altered mental status [^6a844918] [^c802af1c]. Provide **hemodynamic support** with fluids and vasopressors to maintain perfusion [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Antibiotics

Routine antibiotics are **not indicated** for sterile chemical pneumonitis [^c8ffc922] [^880eef48]. Start antibiotics only if secondary bacterial infection is suspected (fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum, or new infiltrates after 24–48 hours) [^c802af1c]. If infection is suspected, use standard CAP regimens (e.g. ceftriaxone plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone) [^ff1d33be]; avoid routine anaerobic coverage unless abscess or empyema is suspected [^c8ffc922] [^11d26a39].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are **not recommended** due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^c802af1c] [^3361b7fb].

---

### Bronchodilators

Bronchodilators may be used for **bronchospasm** or wheezing [^notfound].

---

## Role of bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is **not routine** but should be considered for large-volume particulate aspiration, persistent hypoxia, or suspected obstruction [^c802af1c] [^2034fedf].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for 24–48 hours for clinical deterioration, new infiltrates, or signs of infection [^c8ffc922]. Repeat chest radiography if the patient deteriorates or fails to improve. Provide **patient education** on aspiration risk factors and prevention strategies [^078d7e4f].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: ≥ 30° for patients at risk [^6a844918].

- **Oral hygiene**: Regular oral care to reduce bacterial load [^79e17576].

- **Feeding protocols**: Use postpyloric feeding in high-risk patients [^10bea8bd].

- **Swallowing assessment**: Early speech therapy evaluation for dysphagia [^078d7e4f].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Complications include **secondary bacterial infection**, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute lung injury [^2034fedf]. Prognosis is generally favorable with supportive care; mortality is higher in severe cases or with secondary infection [^c802af1c].

---

Aspiration pneumonitis is managed with **supportive care only**, reserving antibiotics for confirmed or strongly suspected secondary infection. Close monitoring and prevention strategies are essential to reduce morbidity and recurrence.

Background

Aspiration is a common event, but the clinical consequences are variable. The primary determinants are the nature of the aspirated material and the host response to it. The purpose of this paper is to present treatment algorithms that should be employed in critically ill patients who experience aspiration.

Methods

Expert review of the available literature was done to provide background information to support the logic of 3 treatment algorithms: (1) treatment of acute aspiration pneumonitis; (2) pulmonary care for acute aspiration; and (3) treatment of aspiration pneumonia.

Results

The discussion of aspirations is separated into 2 clinical scenarios: (1) aspiration pneumonitis (sterile inflammation) versus (2) aspiration pneumonia (an infectious process). Aspiration pneumonitis should be treated by aggressive pulmonary care to enhance lung volume and clear secretions. Intubation should be used selectively. Early corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. Treatment of aspiration pneumonia requires diligent surveillance for the clinical signs of pneumonia. Treatment decisions are based on 3 factors: (1) clinical diagnostic certainly (definite versus probable), (2) time of onset [early (< 5 days) versus late (≥ 5 days)], and (3) host factors (high risk versus low risk). There is no ideal antibiotic regimen. Unit-specific resistance patterns and known frequency pathogens should direct broad spectrum empiric therapy. Invasive diagnostic techniques (such as bronchoalveolar lavage) should be used when the diagnosis is not certain. Antibiotic coverage should be narrowed once sputum culture results become available.

Conclusions

Aspiration is common in critically ill patients and should be aggressively treated by these treatment algorithms.

### Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis: a spectrum of infectious / noninfectious diseases affecting the lung [^fad1e018]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our purpose is to describe aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis as a spectrum of infectious/noninfectious diseases affecting the lung. We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration.

Recent Findings

Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Aspiration-induced lung injury [^2034fedf]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower respiratory tract is a common event in critically ill patients and can lead to pneumonia or pneumonitis. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of pneumonia in the intensive care unit and is one of the leading risk factors for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndromes. Despite its frequency, it remains largely a disease of exclusion characterized by ill-defined infiltrates on the chest radiograph and hypoxia. An accurate ability to diagnose aspiration is paramount because different modalities of therapy, if applied early and selectively, could change the course of the disease. This article reviews definitions, diagnosis, epidemiology, pathophysiology, including animal models of aspiration-induced lung injury, and evidence-based clinical management. Additionally, a review of current and potential biomarkers that have been tested clinically in humans is provided.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from a PubMed search of the medical literature. PubMed "related articles" search strategies were used.

Summary and Conclusions

Aspiration in the intensive care unit is a clinically relevant problem requiring expertise and awareness. A definitive diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia is challenging to make. Advances in specific biomarker profiles and prediction models may enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of clinical aspiration syndromes. Evidence-based management is supportive, including mechanical ventilation, bronchoscopy for particulate aspiration, consideration of empiric antibiotics for pneumonia treatment, and lower respiratory tract sampling to define pathogenic bacteria that are causative.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^1b72e7ec]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^0b53f7fe]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Future directions

The BTS Standards of Care Committee will, at a later date, decide on the timing and scope of a future update of the BTS CAP Guideline building on the excellence of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline. Topics to be considered for inclusion in future BTS CAP Guideline include the management of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens, specifically influenza, and aspiration pneumonia.

The relative lack of major differences between the NICE and BTS guidelines might be viewed positively as demonstrating coherence and consistency in guidelines. However, it also highlights the relative lack of substantial innovation and advancement over recent years in the evidence base related to the clinical management of CAP. More attention to translational and clinical research is merited if further improvements in the care of patients with CAP are to be gained.

### Incidence and characteristics of aspiration pneumonia in the nagasaki prefecture from 2005 to 2019 [^d907d9ae]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of patients with pneumonia is increasing with an increase in the population of older adults, and aspiration pneumonia accounts for the majority of cases, especially in people aged ≥ 65 years. Patients with dysphagia are more likely to develop pneumonia at a rate of 1.6–11.9 times greater than patients without dysphagia. Taylor et al. revealed that the 30-day mortality from pneumonia in patients at risk of aspiration was 17.2% when compared with 7.7% in patients not at risk. Therefore, in the 2017 Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare report, "aspiration pneumonia" was added as a category of cause of death. The number of deaths owing to aspiration pneumonia was 35,740 (mortality rate, 28.7%), with the disease ranking seventh among the causes of death. A meta-analysis conducted in Japan in 2016 reported that patients with aspiration pneumonia had poorer short- and long-term prognoses than those with other types of pneumonia. Even if the disease does not lead to death and is cured, a decline in physical function and an increase in the amount of assistance required in daily activities are inevitable. Aspiration pneumonia constitutes one of the lung diseases associated with dysphagia. The 2017 Japanese Respiratory Society's guidelines for the management of pneumonia in adults define it as "pneumonia that occurs in cases in which dysphagia and aspiration have been proven (or are strongly suspected)". However, the concept itself remains vague worldwide, and global awareness is lacking; thus, neither diagnostic nor treatment strategies have been clearly established. Therefore, understanding the pathology of aspiration pneumonia, early diagnoses, and establishing an appropriate treatment system are urgent clinical issues.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^0967dbb5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48-72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Multicenter treatment and outcome evaluation of aspiration syndromes in critically ill patients [^b75f76c6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Aspiration syndromes (pneumonia and pneumonitis) have significantly different processes. An evaluation of treatment and outcomes for these different syndromes has not been reported previously.

Objective

To characterize and assess antimicrobial prescribing patterns for aspiration syndromes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and describe outcomes of those patients.

Methods

A retrospective, observational evaluation was conducted using a convenience sample of patients at 27 hospitals in North America; these patients were admitted to an adult ICU with a diagnosis of suspected/confirmed aspiration or had a suspected/confirmed aspiration while in the ICU. Hospital demographic, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome data were collected.

Results

Over a 12 month period, 187 patients were observed. Aspiration syndromes included suspected aspiration (31%; n = 58), aspiration pneumonitis (12%; n = 23), aspiration pneumonia (55%; n = 103), and diagnosis not available (1.6%; n = 3). Antimicrobial management for the aspiration syndromes was as follows: suspected aspiration: 59% single agent, 38% multiple agents, and 3% no therapy; aspiration pneumonitis: 48% single agent, 39% multiple agents, and 13% no therapy; aspiration pneumonia: 48% single agent, 52% multiple agents, and 0% no therapy. Antimicrobial therapy was prescribed in patients with suspected (97%) and confirmed (100%) aspiration. Antibiotic therapy duration was significantly longer for aspiration pneumonia (9.1 ± 7.5 days) than for aspiration pneumonitis (5.2 ± 3.6 days; p = 0.013). Length of ICU stay was similar across patient groups.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial agents are frequently prescribed to treat aspiration syndromes despite the lack of demonstrated efficacy for aspiration pneumonitis. Outcomes between aspiration syndromes were similar with the exception of duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Aspiration pneumonia | NEJM resident 360… [^e42b7976]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published February 13, 2019 Large-volume aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal or upper gastrointestinal contents is the sine qua non of aspiration pneumonia. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are some of the clinical scenarios associated with aspiration pneumonia. Additional risks include degenerative neurologic diseases and impaired consciousness. An important clinical context for aspiration pneumonia is cardiac arrest. The presumed mechanism is aspiration of gastric contents during resuscitation and inhalation of oral secretions during bag–valve–mask ventilation and intubation.

A: Aspiration pneumonia is usually acute, with symptoms developing within hours to a few days after a sentinel event, although anaerobic aspiration may be subacute because of the less virulent bacteria, and clinical features are difficult to distinguish from those of other bacterial pneumonias. Aspiration pneumonia is associated with higher mortality than other forms of pneumonia acquired in the community. The diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia depends on a characteristic clinical history, risk factors, and compatible findings on chest radiography. These radiographic findings include infiltrates in gravity-dependent lung segments.

A: Although the diagnosis is usually clinical, some studies have used quantitative lung-lavage cultures to distinguish bacterial from noninfectious pneumonitis. Several investigations have studied biomarker and biochemical measurements to predict bacterial infection after aspiration. A study involving 65 intubated patients with risk factors for aspiration and a new lung infiltrate correlated quantitative bronchoalveolar-lavage cultures with serum procalcitonin levels. Measurement of procalcitonin levels on days 1 and 3 did not distinguish the 32 patients with culture-positive aspiration pneumonia from the 33 with culture-negative pneumonitis.

In studies of ventilated patients, alpha-amylase levels were elevated in airway secretions, at a frequency reflecting the number of risk factors for aspiration, but the relevance of these findings to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis is not certain, and this is not a method of value for diagnosis.

Mucosal Leishmaniasis

XVII. What are the treatment options for American (New World) mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)?

Recommendations
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the goals of preventing morbidity (e.g. disfigurement) and mortality (e.g. from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruction) [Strong, low].
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic implications [Strong, moderate].
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as indicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic examinations, because of the potential for inflammatory reactions after initiation of antileishmanial therapy [Strong, low].
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of therapy for persons with ML should be individualized (Table 3) [Strong, moderate]. Remarks: The traditional options for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimonial (Sb V) compound (20 mg Sb V /kg daily, IV or IM, for 28–30 days) or with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg per dose, IV, daily or every other day, for a cumulative total of ∼20–45 mg/kg). More recently, on the basis of comparatively limited data, the armamentarium has expanded to include lipid formulations of amphotericin B (typically, liposomal amphotericin B [L-AmB], with a cumulative total dose ranging widely from ∼20–60 mg/kg), as well as the oral agent miltefosine (∼2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^ff1d33be]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is an essential part of management for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been debated and changed over time. Historically, anaerobic bacteria were thought to be the predominant pathogen in aspiration pneumonia. However, in more recent prospective studies, anaerobes were isolated in only 0.5% cases of aspiration pneumoniaand 16% of isolated bacteria.

Thus, the 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on CAP recommend to not routinely add anaerobic coverage in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and to treat with first-line antibiotics for CAP such as ceftriaxone or levofloxacin. This recommendation also considered the potential harmful consequences of broader empiric antibiotic coverage that increase risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis and select for antimicrobial resistance.

Very little evidence is available on the comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotic therapy with limited or extended anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. A recent systematic review found three relevant studies (two observational studies and one randomized controlled trial). All three studies did not show a significant difference in mortality or clinical cure rate with extended anaerobic coverage. However, the small sample sizes that ranged from 117 to 637 patients led to imprecise estimates with large CIs that cannot exclude clinically important differences.

A large multicenter study of aspiration pneumonia that compares first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage is needed to conclude if any clinically important differences exist in effectiveness and adverse effects. To this end, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia to compare first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of C difficile colitis.

### Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for acute aspiration pneumonitis [^880eef48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is frequently prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis, with the intent of preventing the development of aspiration pneumonia. However, few clinical studies have examined the benefits and harms of this practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare outcomes of patients with aspiration pneumonitis who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with supportive care only during the initial 2 days following macroaspiration. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care and antimicrobial therapy received between days 3 and 14 following macroaspiration including escalation of therapy and antibiotic-free days.

Results

Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for acute aspiration pneumonitis, including 76 (38%) who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 (62%) who received supportive management only. After adjusting for patient-level predictors, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mortality (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–1.7; P = 0.7). Patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy were no less likely to require transfer to critical care (5% vs 6%; P = 0.7) and subsequently received more frequent escalation of antibiotic therapy (8% vs 1%; P = 0.002) and fewer antibiotic-free days (7.5 vs 10.9; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit and may generate antibiotic selective pressures that results in the need for escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop aspiration pneumonia.

World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

NMBAs could be used in the appropriate setting for trauma patients, but should be limited to bolus dosing for a maximum of 48 h duration. All patients should have BIS monitoring, if available, when paralyzed to ensure adequate depth of sedation.

Aspiration Pneumonia

Aspiration of gastric contents, due to regurgitation and vomiting, the presence of nasoenteric tubes or loss of airway reflexes (resulting from low level of consciousness) is a distinct risk during the initial assessment phase, operative induction phase, and during ICU care. Brain trauma is a particular risk factor over and above the other risk factors in trauma ICU patients. Furthermore, patients with acute abdomen, major truncal trauma, and those who require emergency surgical intervention have a higher risk. Aspiration is common with an incidence between 30% and 40%, much of which is subclinical. Early antibiotic therapy for simple gastric aspiration is unnecessary, with no benefit shown and the potential for generating resistant organisms. Early bronchoscopy will allow for correct classification between fluid and particulate aspiration, allowing removal of particulate matter and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures can guide therapy, both for aspiration and unexpected early (non‐VAP) pneumonia. Early antibiotic therapy for "sterile" gastric aspiration is not advocated, and selective antibiotics should be deescalated within 72 h if cultures are negative. It remains challenging to distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia. When managed acutely, the morbidity and mortality are lower than other pneumonias in ICU. Where antimicrobials are used, there does not seem to be an outcome difference between baseline first choice and escalated level of antibiotic therapy in this pathology. Short courses of antibiotics, covering community acquired organisms but not anaerobes, may be indicated in cases with aspiration of stasis‐type enteric contents from beyond the stomach or where the aspiration occurs in the fed ICU patient.

### Aspiration pneumonia: a renewed perspective and practical approach [^954b4db9]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia (AP) is a sub-type of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) still poorly recognized especially in the absence of an aspiration event. A further difficulty is the differentiation between AP and aspiration pneumonitis. From a clinical perspective, AP is becoming increasingly relevant as a potential cause of severe and life-threatening respiratory infection among frail and very old patients, particularly among those with CAP requiring inpatient care. Moreover, AP is frequently underdiagnosed and a clear-cut definition of this pathological entity is lacking. There are different factors that increase the risk for aspiration, but other common factors influencing oral colonization such as malnutrition, smoking, poor oral hygiene or dry mouth, are also important in the pathogenesis of AP and should be considered. While there is no doubt in the diagnosis of AP in cases of a recent witnessed aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric content, we here proposed a definition of AP that also includes silent unobserved aspirations. For this reason, the presence of one or more risk factors of oropharyngeal aspiration is required together with one or more risk factors for oral bacterial colonization. This proposed definition based on expert opinion not only unifies the diagnostic criteria of AP, but also provides the possibility to devise easily applicable strategies to prevent oral colonization.

### Pneumonia in older residents of long-term care facilities [^1170399c]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Compared with community-dwelling persons, residents in long-term care facilities have more functional disabilities and underlying medical illnesses and are at increased risk of acquiring infectious diseases. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this group. Risk factors include unwitnessed aspiration, sedative medication, and comorbidity. Recognition may be delayed because, in this population, pneumonia often presents without fever, cough, or dyspnea. Accurate identification of the etiologic agent is hampered because most patients cannot produce a suitable sputum specimen. It is difficult to distinguish colonization from infection. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms can result from aspiration of oral or gastric contents, which could lead to pneumonia. Aspiration of gastric contents also can produce aspiration pneumonitis. This condition is not infectious initially and may resolve without antibiotics. Antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia should cover Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, gram-negative rods, and S. aureus. Acceptable choices include quinolones or an extended-spectrum beta-lactam plus a macrolide. Treatment should last 10 to 14 days. Pneumonia is associated with significant mortality for up to two years. Dementia is related independently to the death rate within the first week after pneumonia, regardless of treatment. Prevention strategies include vaccination against S. pneumoniae and influenza on admission to the care facility. This article focuses on recent recommendations for the recognition of respiratory symptoms and criteria for the designation of probable pneumonia, and provides a guide to hospitalization, antibiotic use, and prevention.

### Pulmonary aspiration syndromes [^9aefdf08]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary aspiration syndromes are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. These syndromes are often misdiagnosed and their management is frequently suboptimal. This paper reviews the clinical features and management of the most common aspiration syndromes.

Recent Findings

Pulmonary aspiration syndromes refer to a group of pulmonary diseases resulting from aspiration of foreign material into the lung. The type of syndrome depends on the quantity and nature of the aspirated material as well as its chronicity. The most common syndromes include aspiration pneumonia, diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis, and aspiration pneumonitis. Aspiration pneumonia and diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis generally occur in elderly, debilitated patients with dysphagia and usually present as 'community acquired pneumonia', which tends to be recurrent in patients with diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis. Treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics and management of the underlying dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonitis follows the aspiration of gastric contents, usually in patients with a marked decreased level of consciousness. Treatment of aspiration pneumonitis is essentially supportive; however, corticosteroids and other immunomodulating agents may have a role in these patients.

Summary

Aspiration syndromes are common with their management dictated by the type of aspiration syndrome.

### AMS in the ICU: empiric therapy and adherence to guidelines for pneumonia [^9ea367d7]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials by selecting the right drug, dose and duration for the appropriate indication, resulting in maximum benefit and minimising adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance. While AMS interventions may appear to be at odds with practice in the intensive care unit (ICU), they can improve quality of care without compromising patient outcomes. This study assessed if empiric antimicrobial therapy aligned with guideline recommendations for critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) non-VAP — We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with HAP who subsequently requires mechanical ventilation. Evidence cited includes one randomized trial in which Sixty-eight patients with HAP were randomly assigned to undergo bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing vs noninvasive management, where expectorated sputum samples were not obtained so noninvasive management resulted in empiric therapy; there was no difference in clinical cure at 28 days or hospital length of stay, and lower 28-day mortality in the empirically treated group was not statistically significant (10% vs 21.9%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, .13–1.61), with fewer patients in the invasive group receiving antibiotics than in the noninvasive group (76% vs 100%). Despite limited evidence, the panel agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain respiratory samples for culture and that respiratory specimens should be obtained noninvasively rather than invasively, noting opportunities to de-escalate antibiotic coverage and that routine invasive sampling via bronchoscopy would be associated with increased cost and increased risks to the patient, including rarely life-threatening complications and temporary worsening of gas exchange that could result in the need for respiratory support.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^0ef7aedc]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician's intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines. The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### North American summit on aspiration in the critically ill patient: consensus statement [^f4a648ce]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Aspiration is the leading cause of pneumonia in the intensive care unit and the most serious complication of enteral tube feeding (ETF). Although aspiration is common, the clinical consequences are variable because of differences in nature of the aspirated material and individual host responses. A number of defense mechanisms normally present in the upper aerodigestive system that protect against aspiration become compromised by clinical events that occur frequently in the critical care setting, subjecting the patient to increased risk. The true incidence of aspiration has been difficult to determine in the past because of vague definitions, poor assessment monitors, and varying levels of clinical recognition. Standardization of terminology is an important step in helping to define the problem, design appropriate research studies, and develop strategies to reduce risk. Traditional clinical monitors of glucose oxidase strips and blue food coloring (BFC) should no longer be used. A modified approach to use of gastric residual volumes and identification of clinical factors that predispose to aspiration allow for risk stratification and an algorhythm approach to the management of the critically ill patient on ETF. Although the patient with confirmed aspiration should be monitored for clinical consequences and receive supportive pulmonary care, ETF may be continued when accompanied by appropriate steps to reduce risk of further aspiration. Management strategies for treating aspiration pneumonia are based on degree of diagnostic certainty, time of onset, and host factors.

### Aspiration pneumonias: under-diagnosed and under-treated [^fe602553]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine recent advancements of the epidemiology, risk factors, bacteriology, diagnostic measures, and treatment for aspiration pneumonia.

Recent Findings

In a large prospective study, 10.3% of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was associated with aspiration pneumonia, as opposed to 30% when patients were admitted from long-term facilities. A murine stroke model showed increased apoptosis of cell-mediated immune cells due to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Subsequent nasal inoculum of low-dose Streptococcus pneumoniae caused severe pneumonia. Another murine study showed intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid-primed lungs more susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tracheal pH monitoring demonstrated acidification of trachea in 28% of patients with acute stroke deemed to be safe for oral feeding. Various antimicrobial agents used to treat aspiration pneumonia have comparable success rates. However, clindamycin was the only agent that did not propagate emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia is prevalent in community-acquired pneumonia. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of sympathetic nervous system and aspiration pneumonitis as primers for lung infection. Predicting aspiration risk is difficult and newer diagnostic tools are necessary. Antimicrobials used in aspiration pneumonia have similar success rates although the development of resistant organisms must be monitored.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^75148d7d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis or viruses such as influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0% and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8, 100 and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected on the basis of presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has compared ABPC/SBT with CTRX in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia patients. However, that study was a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis and whether this result is applicable to aspiration pneumonia in clinical practice remains unclear.

Some reports have described CAP excluding aspiration pneumonia, but most previous studies of antibiotic treatments for CAP have included patients with aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, no reports have compared CTRX and ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP in patients without risk factors for aspiration. We therefore carried out the present study with the aim of investigating whether CTRX might be more effective than ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP, after excluding cases of aspiration pneumonia.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^9cddbcf2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage are used commonly to treat aspiration pneumonia, which is not recommended by current guidelines.

Research Question

In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) vs antibiotic therapy with extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022. Patients were included if the physician diagnosed aspiration pneumonia and prescribed guideline-concordant first-line community-acquired pneumonia parenteral antibiotic therapy to the patient within 48 h of admission. Patients then were categorized into the LAC group if they received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin. Patients were categorized into the EAC group if they received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incident C difficile colitis occurring after admission. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance baseline prognostic factors.

Results

The LAC and EAC groups included 2,683 and 1,316 patients, respectively. In hospital, 814 patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups died, respectively. C difficile colitis occurred in five or fewer patients (≤ 0.2%) and 11 to 15 patients (0.8%-1.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. After overlap weighting of propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference of EAC minus LAC was 1.6% (95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%) for in-hospital mortality and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) for C difficile colitis.

Interpretation

We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no additional mortality benefit, only an increased risk of C difficile colitis.

### Antibiotics for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia-reply… [^88e42c03]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

In reply Dr Joseph raises a very important question, one that we discussed extensively when designing our study. Research in children and adults with pulmonary disease secondary to aspiration of oral contents has repeatedly documented the presence of oral anaerobic bacteria in the pulmonary trees of affected patients. 1–3 These organisms do not exist in the lungs of healthy persons. As a result, systemic antibiotic therapy has become the standard of care for this disease, although, to our knowledge, no placebo-controlled trials have ever been conducted.

### Bronchoaspiration: incidence, consequences and management [^3361b7fb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Aspiration is defined as the inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the lower respiratory tract. Upon injury, epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages secrete chemical mediators, attracting and activating neutrophils, which in turn release proteases and reactive oxygen species, degrading the alveolocapillary unit. Aspiration can lead to a range of diseases such as infectious pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis or respiratory distress syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality. It occurs in approximately 3–10 per 10 000 operations with an increased incidence in obstetric and paediatric anaesthesia. Patients are most at risk during induction of anaesthesia and extubation, in particular in emergency situations. The likelihood of significant aspiration can be reduced by fasting, pharmacological intervention and correct anaesthetic management using a rapid sequence induction. Treatment of acid aspiration is by suctioning after witnessed aspiration; antibiotics are indicated in patients with aspiration pneumonia only. Steroids are not proven to improve outcome or reduce mortality. Patients with acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation should be ventilated using lung protective strategies with low tidal volumes and low plateau pressure values, attempting to limit peak lung distension and end-expiratory collapse.

### ABM clinical protocol # 25: recommendations for preprocedural fasting for the breastfed infant: "NPO" guidelines [^e48e0e5b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #25 — preprocedural fasting for breastfed infants defines scope, minimum fasting aims, and safety context, stating this protocol will help define the minimum fasting requirements for breastfed infants and provide suggestions to avoid unnecessary fasting while improving the infant's safety and comfort during the required fasting periods; stated goals are to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during anesthesia or sedation, prevent hypoglycemia intraoperatively and during the NPO period, prevent volume depletion and maximize hemodynamics, minimize stress or anxiety in the NPO infant, and support optimal breastfeeding of the dyad before and after the procedure. Both general anesthesia and moderate sedation require adherence to the same fasting guidelines, and per American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidance sedation and analgesia comprise a continuum of states ranging from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) through general anesthesia; for this protocol the term anesthesia is used to encompass the continuum of moderate sedation to general anesthesia. Mechanistically, upon initiation of sedation or induction of anesthesia, the gag and cough reflexes are inhibited, allowing residual stomach contents to regurgitate into the open larynx and cause aspiration of solid particulates and acidic gastric juices, which can then lead to pneumonitis or pneumonia; while the incidence of aspiration is low with proper fasting (where from 3 to 10 out of every 10,000 anesthetics performed on children), aspiration pneumonitis may necessitate mechanical ventilation and/or a prolonged hospital course, and infants with multiple co-morbidities are placed in a higher risk stratification by the ASA with a higher incidence of aspiration. Historically, all patients had to be NPO or nothing by mouth after midnight to avoid pulmonary aspiration syndrome, and the safest practice and most effective prevention of pulmonary aspiration is adherence to current fasting guidelines.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^6cbab787]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — antibiotics: Although microorganisms present in aspirated water may eventually cause pneumonia, no study to date has shown benefit from empiric administration of antibiotics in drowning patients, and microorganisms found in drowning-associated pneumonia are atypical bacteria or fungi and often are resistant to standard empiric treatments. Aspiration of even small volumes of water can produce radiographic abnormalities that can mimic pneumonia, and trauma, hypoxemia, and airway irritation can cause leukocytosis and fever, complicating differentiation from infection. We do not recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in the initial treatment of drowning patients; after initial resuscitation, if pneumonia is present, treatment should be guided by bacterial culture or antigen testing, and in the absence of these tests the decision to start should be based on clinical examination for physical evidence of infection. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) diagnosis — HIV-exposed or HIV-infected children — often shows hypoxia with "PaO2 typically < 70 mm Hg" and "an A-a gradient > 30 mmHg", and immunologic markers where "CD4 percentage is often < 15% and CD4 counts are usually < 200 cells/ mm3 in children aged 6 years and older". A "definitive diagnosis of PCP requires demonstration of the organism in pulmonary tissues or fluids in the presence of pneumonitis". Induced sputum after nebulized "3% hypertonic saline" may be difficult in those "aged < 2 years" and the "Sensitivity of sputum analysis ranges from 25% to 90%". Nasogastric aspirates can detect organisms, reported in "48.6%" when obtained on "three consecutive mornings". Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is "the diagnostic procedure of choice for most infants and children", with "Sensitivity ranges from 55% to 97%" and results "positive for ≥ 72 hours after initiation of PCP treatment; treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results". If bronchoalveolar lavage is negative or non-diagnostic, "Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with trans-bronchial biopsy is recommended only" and has "Sensitivity is 87% to 95%", with cysts identified "up to 10 days after initiation of treatment", but it is "contraindicated in children with thrombocytopenia". "Open-lung biopsy is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic technique, but not recommended routinely because it requires thoracotomy and often chest tube drainage".

### Early management after self-poisoning with an organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide-a treatment protocol for junior doctors [^af0da9c7]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Oximes and other therapies

The clinical benefit of oximes for OP pesticide poisoning is not clear, being limited by the type of OP, poison load, time to start of therapy, and dose of oxime. Current World Health Organisation guidelines recommend giving a 30 mg/kg loading dose of pralidoxime over 10–20 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 8–10 mg/kg per hour until clinical recovery (for example 12–24 hours after atropine is no longer required or the patient is extubated) or 7 days, whichever is later. Where obidoxime is available, a loading dose of 250 mg is followed by an infusion giving 750 mg every 24 hours. Too rapid administration will result in vomiting, tachycardia and hypertension (especially diastolic hypertension).

Oximes are not recommended for carbamate poisoning.

The role of hydrocortisone and antibiotic treatment after aspiration is not known. Aspiration of pesticide and stomach contents initially causes a chemical pneumonitis and not pneumonia. It is unknown whether pneumonitis benefits from steroids. Pneumonia is diagnosed if the fever persists for more than 48 hours or there is focal consolidation on X-ray. Earlier use of antibiotics risks antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.

Alcohol co-ingestion requires assessment of blood sugar levels and vitamin B supplementation.

### Nosocomial pneumonia [^2337ff85]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the most recent advances in the management and prevention of nosocomial pneumonia. The new ATS guidelines in particular are most likely to affect clinical practice outside the USA.

Recent Findings

The problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia seems to be increasing. This is particularly true for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While the diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia remains a conflictive issue, serial tracheobronchial aspirates may improve the selection of adequate antimicrobial treatment. Combined beta-lactam and aminoglycoside therapy is inferior to beta-lactam monotherapy, both in terms of clinical outcome and in the prevention of resistance during treatment; in addition, it carries an increased risk of nephrotoxicity.

Summary

The updated ATS guidelines will considerably impact clinical approaches to nosocomial and healthcare-related pneumonia. Serial tracheobronchial aspirates can be used to guide selection of antimicrobial treatment in ventilator associated pneumonia. The combination of beta-lactams and aminoglycosides is likely to be abandoned in the future. New potent treatment options for pneumonia due to nonfermenters are urgently needed.

CHEST grading system — strong recommendations (1A–1C) define benefit–risk balance, evidence quality, and implications as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) has "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B) uses the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C) retains the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances.

Anesthesiology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines — purposes and clinical focus — state that the purposes are to provide direction for clinical practice related to preoperative fasting and the use of pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration and to reduce the severity of complications related to perioperative pulmonary aspiration. Clinical practice includes withholding liquids and solids for specified time periods before surgery and prescribing pharmacologic agents to reduce gastric volume and acidity, and enhancements include utilization of perioperative preventive medication, increased patient satisfaction, avoidance of delays and cancellations, decreased risk of dehydration or hypoglycemia from prolonged fasting, and minimization of perioperative morbidity. Complications of aspiration include aspiration pneumonia, respiratory compromise, and related morbidities, and prevention of perioperative pulmonary aspiration is part of preoperative evaluation and preparation.

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia: risk factors, clinical features, management, and antibiotic resistance [^a3071025]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to summarize recent developments regarding risks factors, clinical features, management and antimicrobial resistance, and prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia developing in specific ICUs (neurologic and cardiovascular surgery) were reported. Characteristics of pneumonia acquired in general wards but requiring ICU admission were studied. Analysis of the impact of reintubation on pneumonia occurrence demonstrated that only reintubation after accidental extubation increases the risk. Early administration of adequate antibiotic(s), associated with a deescalating strategy, remains the only measure directly amenable to modification by clinicians that decreases the infection-related mortality. Numerous data emphasized the recommendation that guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia therapy should be updated and customized to local patterns to improve the level of adequacy of antimicrobial treatment. A 8-day treatment regimen could be proposed when pneumonia is not caused by a nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli. In cases of pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, linezolid, compared with vancomycin, significantly increases the rates of cure and survival. Semirecumbent positioning in all eligible patients, sucralfate rather than H2 antagonists in patients at low to moderate risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and, in selected patients, aspiration of subglottic secretions and oscillating beds are the measures proposed to prevent the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Conversely, the routine or indiscriminate use of selective digestive decontamination is not recommended.

Summary

In our opinion, the optimization of the length of treatment and the reduction of mortality with linezolid in staphylococcal pneumonia are two major recent developments.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.

### Future considerations in aspiration pneumonia in the critically ill patient: what is not known, areas for future research, and experimental methods [^018bfece]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

The medical literature supports the use of enteral feeding to provide nutrition and improve patient outcomes. A major complication of enteral feeding is aspiration and associated morbidity and mortality. Many knowledge gaps exist that inhibit our ability to define and diagnose aspiration, identify patients at risk, and develop prevention techniques. Several areas of inquiry should be explored to help us define and prevent the disorder — for instance, standardized criteria should be developed for diagnosing aspiration pneumonia and for differentiating it from other types of pneumonia, and accurate tests should be devised for detecting it. Research also is needed to evaluate the influence of (1) various enteral feeding sites on aspiration risk, (2) the effects of risk reduction techniques such as selective decontamination and use of promotility agents, and (3) potential benefits of immunonutrition. Current parameters used in decisions about when to initiate enteral feeding in critically ill patients are defined.

### Use of modified diets to prevent aspiration in oropharyngeal dysphagia: is current practice justified? [^9ba18677]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Communicating with patients about modified diets

Tone of discussions and strength of recommendations

The tone of the discussions between clinicians and patients and the strength of recommendations of the former should be highly dependent on the quality of the evidence. There should be, in effect, a sliding scale of how strongly clinicians should recommend modified diets from, for example, urging or pleading with a reluctant or non-compliant patient to accept some modification of food texture if their risk of an asphyxial death is high to, at most, a tentative suggestion of a trial of therapy if there might be sufficient benefit from a thick fluid consistency to offset the risks of dehydration and impact on quality of life. Ultimately, the patient must understand that, irrespective of the view of the clinician, he or she has a choice.

What level of disclosure is required regarding benefits and risks

Clinician recommendations and patient decisions are based on their relative assessments of whether the potential benefits of modified diets (or other interventions) will outweigh the potential risks (including impaired quality of life). It is for the patient to decide how he or she would judge that balance. In order to make that decision the patient needs and is entitled to information, not only about the potential for reducing aspiration pneumonia, but about possible risks and hazards, including underhydration and nutrition and the impact on quality of life. Uncertainty, while a potential cause of stress for patients, is a fair description of current knowledge of the potential benefits and risks from modified diets and should be acknowledged and communicated when discussing this intervention. It would be unacceptable to seek to withhold information about the possible hazards of modified fluids to try and improve adherence to clinician recommendations.

Quality of life

Quality of life is as or more important than quantity of life for many people. The fact that modified diets often worsen quality of life suggests that non-compliance is an understandable and rational choice for many people. This would still be the case even if there were evidence that non-compliance result in adverse effects. One benefit of reviewing patients who have had a trial of therapy with modified diets is that they can balance any possible benefits (such as absence of chest infections), possible risks (such as need for treatment with parenteral fluids) and their lived experience with modified diets and make a fresh, and more-informed, decision whether to continue with a modified diet.

Postpyloric feeding tube placement — patient selection: Consider postpyloric feeding tube placement in patients with gastric feeding intolerance and high risk for aspiration (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Both the quality and breadth of studies vary in their assessment of whether postpyloric feeding is associated with decreases in ventilator, ICU, and/or hospital length of stay, and placement requires special expertise that is not available in all centers and may incur delay in placement. Postpyloric feeding is considered less physiologic than gastric feeding and should therefore be reserved for patients with gastric feeding intolerance and for patients at high risk for aspiration as detailed in nutrition society guidelines.

### Aspiration pneumonia: incidence, mortality, and at-risk populations [^9cec380a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary aspiration in the hospitalized patient can be devastating. Most aspiration events occur in patients with a swallowing disorder. Aspiration can be divided into 3 separate etiologies: oropharyngeal bacteria, particulate matter, and acidified gastric contents. Reported prevalence data are extremely variable, ranging from 10% to 70%. Mortality is related to the volume and content of the aspirate and is reported to be as high as 70%. Neurologic dysfunction, decreased consciousness, advancing age, gastroesophageal reflux, and tube feeding are all potential risk factors for the development of aspiration.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^28f2e0f2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A multidisciplinary (pulmonologists, radiologists, methodologists, pathologists, and patient) panel of experts from the ATS, JRS, and ALAT was composed to identify clinically important questions about diagnostic testing for HP among patients with newly identified ILD. The CPG was created in two parts. The first portion describes clinical, radiological, and pathological features of HP while proposing a definition, diagnostic criteria, and a diagnostic algorithm. It was approached in a consensus fashion and informed by a nonsystematic review of the literature. The second portion makes graded recommendations that answer questions about whether to perform a diagnostic intervention. It was informed by National Academy of Medicine–adherent guideline methodology, including a full systematic review for each question and the formulation, writing, and grading of recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For a detailed description of the methods, see the online supplement.

Implications of the different degrees of recommendation are described in Table 1. Using the GRADE approach, each recommendation was rated as either a "recommendation" or a "suggestion". The meaning of a recommendation is the same as a strong recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature, and the meaning of a suggestion is the same as a weak or conditional recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature. Typical GRADE nomenclature was altered for this guideline to address prior criticism that the term "conditional" created uncertainty in the context of translation into non-English languages.

### Special issue: abstracts of the 11Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, helsinki, Finland [^e5f242c2]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and aims: Post‐stroke patients using nasogastric tubes are at increased risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Prokinetics may help prevent pneumonia by enhancing gastric emptying and reducing gastroesophageal reflux, both of which are risk factors for aspiration. However, studies are controversy regarding the prevention of pneumonia in such patients. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of prokinetics in preventing pneumonia in post‐stroke patients using nasogastric tubes.

Methods: We systematically searched the literature for randomized controlled trials on Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases from inception to November 2024. The primary efficacy outcome assessed was incidence of pneumonia. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 and the ROBINS‐1 tools.

Results: Of 326 articles screened, 3 randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 600 patients. The intervention group comprised 291 patients, and the control group comprised 309 patients. The overall risk ratio (RR) for pneumonia in the intervention group compared to the control group was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.50–1.27, p > 0.05), indicating no statistically significant reduction in pneumonia risk with the intervention. High heterogeneity was observed among studies (I² = 87%, p < 0.001), reflecting substantial variability in outcomes.

Conclusion: Current data does not indicate any correlation between the use of prokinetics and the incidence of pneumonia in patients in use of nasogastric tubes. More trials would help with more robust evidence. Currently, there are no formal guidelines or standardized recommendations for their use in this context.

Disclosure: All authors report no relationships that could be construed as a conflict of interest. All authors take responsibility for all aspects of the reliability and freedom from bias of the data presented and their discussed interpretation.

### Respiratory complications following hydrocarbon aspiration in children [^700be656]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Accidental hydrocarbon ingestion may lead to aspiration and chemical pneumonitis in children. In this review article, the clinical course of hydrocarbon pneumonitis, chest radiographic abnormalities, complications, and treatment interventions are summarized. Most children remain asymptomatic and without complications following ingestion of a hydrocarbon. In approximately 15% of ingestions, aspiration pneumonitis occurs and evolves over the first 6-8hr presenting with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. A symptom zenith is reached within 48hr followed by progressive improvement. Up to 5% of pneumonitis cases progress rapidly to acute respiratory failure. Chest radiographic abnormalities develop by 4-8hr after ingestion, but they are not always predictive of clinical pneumonitis. Patients with history of hydrocarbon ingestion should be monitored for 6-8hr in the emergency department and a chest radiogram should be obtained at the end of the observation period. Spontaneous or induced emesis and gastric lavage have been related to aspiration pneumonitis. Children who are symptomatic are admitted to the hospital for cardiorespiratory status monitoring and supportive care. Approximately 90% of hospitalized patients have a benign clinical course. Increased work of breathing with or without altered sensorium and seizures are indications for admission to the intensive care unit. Hypoxemia unresponsive to supplemental oxygen and/or severe central nervous system involvement require mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids do not seem to offer any benefit and antibiotics are administered in cases of bacterial superinfection. Pneumatoceles may become evident after the first 6–10 days of symptoms on follow-up chest radiograms and they resolve up to 6 months later.

NASEMSO Model Clinical Guideline: Prehospital Airway Management — patient safety considerations highlight aspiration prevention and ventilator-associated pneumonia risk reduction. Prioritize suctioning to limit aspiration, which may reduce hospital-acquired pneumonia, ICU length of stay, and mortality. Head elevation to 30–45 degrees when tolerated and without contraindication is associated with lower rates of ventilator associated pneumonia in the ICU setting.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^24babb34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^2017b674]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading system — weak recommendations (2A–2C) specify that Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) has "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden", is based on "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B) uses the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies", and the implication "Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C) notes "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced", relies on "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence", and implies "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate".

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^f784c2a1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines — recommendation strength and wording — label recommendations using the GRADE approach, with all recommendations designated as either "strong" or "weak" (conditional); the phrases "we recommend" indicate strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicate weak recommendations, and Table 1 provides the suggested interpretation for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers; given ongoing research needs across topics, "Research Needs" were noted for recommendations in which the need was believed to be particularly acute, and high-quality evidence was lacking for many recommendations.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum faciale in a patient with Crohn's disease [^090ea755]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

PG most commonly presents extracutaneously in the lungs and typically affects 30- to 60-year-old women. Symptoms are variable, and most commonly include fever and cough, whereas other signs of respiratory involvement, such as dyspnea, crackles, and stridor, are reported less frequently. Chest radiograph and CT scan can reveal noncavitating or cavitating infiltrates or pulmonary nodules. Given the rarity of pulmonary PG and its variable presentation, no clinical guidelines exist for diagnosis and treatment. A differential diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, infection, and malignancy is typically considered. Our patient's delayed swallowing trigger and incomplete laryngohyoid elevation from PG-induced cranial nerve dysfunction increase her aspiration risk. Therefore, respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates, as well as reasonable rule out of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, suggest a differential diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, or pulmonary PG. Misdiagnosis can prove deadly, as reducing immunosuppressive treatment may cause a pulmonary PG flare, whereas continuing immunosuppressants allows progression of aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis.

Here we present an unusual case of facial and perianal PG in a patient with occult underlying CD complicated by pulmonary disease of uncertain etiology. Patients with PG faciale should be assessed for dysphagia, and pulmonary disease must be adequately investigated to determine best management strategies.

### Pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis in nursing home residents: diagnosis and management [^1acea6e9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the frequency of aspiration pneumonitis in nursing home residents with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia and to compare the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of aspiration pneumonitis with those of pneumonia.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Hospital geriatric unit for nursing home residents.

Participants

Nursing home residents admitted to the inpatient geriatric unit with suspected pneumonia between May 1999 and April 2001 (n = 195 episodes).

Measurements

Aspiration events were defined as definite (witnessed or unwitnessed) or suspected. Aspiration pneumonitis was defined as symptoms/signs of lower respiratory tract infection plus a history of an aspiration event plus a lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph. Pneumonia was defined as symptoms/signs of lower respiratory tract infection plus an infiltrate on chest radiograph plus no history of an aspiration event.

Results

The 195 episodes were stratified into three clinical groups: aspiration pneumonitis (n = 86; aspiration history/infiltrate), pneumonia (n = 43; no aspiration history/infiltrate), and an aspiration event (n = 66; aspiration history/no infiltrate). In general, symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests were not useful in distinguishing between the three groups. Survivors with aspiration pneumonitis (13/75 (17%)) or with an aspiration event (20/60 (33%)) were significantly more likely not to be treated with an antibiotic or to be treated for 1 day or less than those with pneumonia (0/41; P < .001). Excluding those not treated, significantly more patients with pneumonia (33/40 (83%)) were discharged on antibiotic treatment than those with aspiration pneumonitis (35/70 (50%)) or an aspiration event (21/51 (41%); P < .001). There was no significant difference in hospital mortality between the three clinical groups.

Conclusions

The findings of this study have implications for the diagnosis and management of suspected pneumonia in nursing home residents but require prospective validation.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b6c1c12e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Bubonic plague — diagnosis and treatment recommendations specify that bubonic plague should be diagnosed by Gram stain and culture of aspirated material from a suppurative lymph node (strong, moderate), and that streptomycin (15 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] every 12 hours) or doxycycline (100 mg bid po) is recommended for treatment (strong, low), with gentamicin as a substitute for streptomycin (strong, low). Supporting details note that streptomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours (adjusted for renal function) is the treatment of choice, the optimal treatment duration is unknown but 10–14 days is probably adequate, and patients with bubonic plague may develop secondary pneumonic plague and should be placed in respiratory isolation until after 48 hours of effective drug therapy.

### Aspiration pneumonia… [^5906e86d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical records of 47 patients with documented aspiration were reviewed. The overall mortality was 62%. If only one lobe was involved roentgenographically, mortality was 41%. If two or more lobes on one or both sides were involved, mortality was in the range of 90%. Acutely ill, comatose patients with gastrointestinal or neurologic disease and an indwelling nasogastric tube were at particular risk. All hospital patients, however, appear to be vulnerable. Antibiotics, steroids, and ventilatory assistance were utilized in various combinations, but none seemed to effectively change the outcome following aspiration. Cameron JL, Mitchell WH, Zuidema GD. Aspiration Pneumonia: Clinical Outcome Following Documented Aspiration. Arch Surg. 1973; 106: 49–52.
