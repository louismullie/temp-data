## Question

Motility agents to treat gastroparesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about motility agents to treat gastroparesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the treatment goal and scope for "motility agents". Then, I should review the first-line prokinetics endorsed by major guidelines and verify their regulatory status. Next, I will examine mechanism of action and practical dosing strategies, followed by safety, tolerability, and drug–drug interaction issues. After that, I need to consider agents not recommended as first-line, clarify the role of antiemetics versus prokinetics, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm for initiation, monitoring, and adjustments over time.

> Let me first confirm the treatment objective and scope. "Motility agents" here should mean prokinetic drugs that improve gastric emptying, while acknowledging that symptom control often requires separate antiemetic therapy because nausea/vomiting reduction does not necessarily follow from faster emptying; this is why guidelines separate prokinetics from antiemetics and emphasize a multimodal approach with dietary measures and glycemic optimization, particularly in diabetes, before and alongside pharmacotherapy [^116JyUGM] [^114zeefF].

> I need to verify first-line prokinetic recommendations. The 2025 AGA guideline issues conditional recommendations to consider metoclopramide or erythromycin as initial pharmacologic therapy, with shared decision-making given low-to-very low certainty evidence and the need to balance benefits and harms; this aligns with ACG 2022 guidance that suggests metoclopramide and also suggests 5-HT4 agonists to improve gastric emptying, although prucalopride did not meet clinically meaningful thresholds in trials and is not favored as first-line in AGA 2025 [^1129CfmE] [^112Zpd8g] [^116LBzaw] [^1115dWDf] [^111h5Hp7].

> Hold on, I should verify regulatory status before drawing conclusions. Metoclopramide remains the only FDA-approved medication for gastroparesis, which is why it is often the default starting prokinetic in the U.S.; domperidone is not FDA-approved and requires an expanded access IND in the U.S., with practical supply constraints complicating its use, and recent AGA guidance places domperidone as not first-line while acknowledging it may be reasonable when metoclopramide is not tolerated or declined [^114JKnxP] [^112Fe3Z4].

> Let me consider metoclopramide's mechanism, dosing, and safety in detail. As a dopamine D2 antagonist with 5-HT4 agonism, it increases gastric emptying; typical oral dosing starts at 5 mg before meals and can be titrated to 10 mg, while intranasal metoclopramide is dosed 15 mg before meals and at bedtime; I should confirm that clinicians reassess at 4–8 weeks and consider drug holidays to mitigate risk, and yes, AGA advises periodic breaks and structured monitoring given the FDA black box warning for tardive dyskinesia; absolute risk appears low but higher in older adults and those on psychotropics, and newer data, including intranasal formulations, support modest symptom benefits, particularly for vomiting reduction, while early satiety and fullness are less responsive [^116hAjrb] [^114GAPbt] [^114ovh6q] [^114XC5bz].

> Next, I should review erythromycin carefully. Mechanistically, erythromycin is a motilin receptor agonist that triggers phase III MMC and improves antral contractility; dosing is best at low, pre-meal doses, commonly 40–150 mg 30 minutes before meals using ethylsuccinate suspension to allow fine titration, and to reduce tachyphylaxis, a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule is advised; safety concerns include QT prolongation, CYP3A interactions, and antibiotic resistance with prolonged use, and azithromycin has been used off-label in select cases but remains investigational without robust symptom data; wait, let me verify the evidence signal — RCTs show robust acceleration of gastric emptying but inconsistent symptom benefit, which is why it is reserved for short-term or intermittent use in practice [^112Zpd8g] [^114kdfou] [^111Us4DK] [^111Gp8L6] [^112s5wxp].

> I will now examine agents not recommended as first-line. Domperidone has supportive ACG guidance but is not FDA-approved and carries QT risk, mandating baseline and on-treatment ECGs and electrolyte monitoring; prucalopride failed to meet clinically meaningful thresholds in RCTs and carries psychiatric adverse event signals, so AGA recommends against first-line use; nortriptyline is better framed as a neuromodulator for pain or dyspeptic symptoms rather than a motility agent; aprepitant showed limited benefit and does not improve gastric emptying, so it is not a prokinetic; ghrelin agonists are not recommended by ACG pending better evidence; I should double-check that all of these positions align with current guideline language, and they do [^112Fe3Z4] [^111h5Hp7] [^115VWTFP] [^1124Qmfv] [^113vyFDV].

> But wait, what about agents with strong prokinetic signals in network meta-analyses. Clebopride ranked highly for global symptom improvement, yet it is not FDA-approved in the U.S. and is not practically accessible; this underscores the gap between trial signals and available therapies and reinforces the centrality of metoclopramide and intermittent erythromycin within current U.S. practice [^116GYo4c].

> I need to ensure I clearly distinguish prokinetics from antiemetics. Antiemetics such as 5-HT3 antagonists, H1 antagonists, and dopamine D2 antagonists reduce nausea and vomiting without improving gastric emptying; guidelines advise using antiemetics as needed alongside prokinetics, and reassessing at 4–8 weeks to decide continuation, which matches the clinical observation that prokinetics alone often incompletely control emesis [^115aAKqs] [^113uFeAo] [^116JyUGM].

> Let me first confirm foundational management steps that enhance prokinetic effectiveness. Glycemic control should be optimized because hyperglycemia slows gastric emptying and can blunt prokinetic response; agents that delay emptying — especially opioids and GLP-1 receptor agonists — should be minimized or discontinued when feasible; dietary therapy with small-particle, low-fat, low-residue meals is recommended before or alongside medications; and in severe or refractory cases, a multidisciplinary approach including nutritional support is advised, all of which can reduce pill burden and improve outcomes [^116JyUGM] [^112yZQ8G] [^112TYjgA] [^113o95wf].

> I should double-check drug–drug interaction risks when combining therapies. Metoclopramide and domperidone share CYP pathways with numerous co-medications, and erythromycin's CYP3A inhibition increases QT risk; a medication reconciliation with attention to QT-prolonging agents and electrolyte disturbances is prudent before initiating prokinetics, especially in polypharmacy [^1117gK2x] [^114kdfou].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic monitoring and adjustment algorithm. Initiate metoclopramide or erythromycin with informed consent about tardive dyskinesia or QT risks, respectively; reassess symptoms, tolerability, and safety at 4–8 weeks; if metoclopramide is ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider switching to intermittent low-dose erythromycin; if both fail, evaluate for medically refractory disease, confirm the diagnosis with appropriate 4-hour gastric emptying testing off confounders, and escalate to advanced therapies such as G-POEM or gastric electrical stimulation in expert centers, keeping in mind that endoscopic pyloric interventions have promising but heterogeneous evidence [^1129CfmE] [^112cPj6d] [^115R8B59] [^111Z92eS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought prucalopride might be broadly recommended because it is a 5-HT4 agonist; let me reconsider. AGA 2025 recommends against first-line prucalopride in gastroparesis due to lack of clinically meaningful benefit and safety concerns, despite its approval for chronic idiopathic constipation, so I should correct that earlier assumption and restrict its role to select patients with overlapping constipation where benefits might reasonably be expected [^111h5Hp7].

> Final synthesis: In current U.S. practice, metoclopramide is the only FDA-approved prokinetic and is the usual first-line choice, with erythromycin as an intermittent, short-term alternative when metoclopramide is contraindicated, unavailable, or ineffective; domperidone may be considered via expanded access where appropriate; antiemetics are adjuncts for symptom control; and all pharmacotherapy should be layered on top of dietary modification, glycemic optimization, and removal of motility-slowing drugs, with reassessment at 4–8 weeks to guide continuation or escalation strategies [^114JKnxP] [^1129CfmE] [^116JyUGM] [^112Zpd8g].

---

Prokinetic agents are the cornerstone of gastroparesis management, with **metoclopramide as the only FDA-approved option** [^114JKnxP] [^1117gK2x]. Erythromycin is a **short-term alternative** due to tachyphylaxis and QT risk [^112Zpd8g] [^115HU9Ky]; domperidone is used where available but requires ECG monitoring [^114BhCjA] [^112Fe3Z4]. Prucalopride and ghrelin agonists are **not recommended** [^111h5Hp7] [^113vyFDV]. Therapy should be individualized, reassessed at 4–8 weeks [^114FLnEZ], and combined with dietary measures and glycemic control [^112TYjgA] [^116JyUGM].

## Mechanisms of action

Prokinetic agents **enhance gastric motility** through distinct mechanisms:

| **Agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical effect** |
|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine D2 antagonist; 5-HT4 agonist | Increased gastric emptying; antiemetic |
| Erythromycin | Motilin receptor agonist | Strongly accelerates gastric emptying |
| Domperidone | Peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist | Increased gastric emptying; antiemetic |
| Prucalopride | 5-HT4 agonist | Modest gastric emptying improvement |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Metoclopramide**: Reduces vomiting by 0.92 points and improves global symptoms; modest benefit on nausea and fullness [^114XC5bz].
- **Erythromycin**: Rapidly improves gastric emptying; symptomatic benefit limited by tachyphylaxis and adverse effects [^1152oWDy] [^112s5wxp].
- **Domperidone**: Improves symptoms with fewer neurologic effects than metoclopramide; limited access and QT risk [^112Fe3Z4].
- **Prucalopride**: No consistent symptom benefit; not recommended first-line [^111h5Hp7].

---

## Safety profiles and adverse effects

- **Metoclopramide**: Black box warning for tardive dyskinesia; risk higher with prolonged use, older age, and psychotropics [^114ovh6q]; monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and drug-induced Parkinsonism [^notfound].
- **Erythromycin**: QT prolongation; tachyphylaxis; CYP3A interactions; limit to short-term use [^112Zpd8g] [^115HU9Ky].
- **Domperidone**: QT prolongation; requires baseline and periodic ECG and electrolytes [^112Fe3Z4].
- **Prucalopride**: Depression and suicidal ideation reported; use cautiously [^111h5Hp7].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

AGA 2025 recommends **metoclopramide or erythromycin** as initial therapy, with reassessment at 4–8 weeks [^114zeefF]; **domperidone** may be considered where available with ECG monitoring [^112Fe3Z4]. ACG 2022 likewise supports metoclopramide, erythromycin, and domperidone, and recommends 5-HT4 agonists to improve gastric emptying [^115nKT9e] [^116apPjc].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Evidence quality is **limited**, with low-to-moderate certainty and small trials [^1168Ghpb]; **tachyphylaxis** limits sustained efficacy, particularly with erythromycin [^112Zpd8g] [^115HU9Ky]; and **adverse effects**, including neurologic and cardiac risks, constrain long-term use [^114ovh6q] [^112Zpd8g].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Gastric electrical stimulation**: Consider for refractory cases [^115R8B59].
- **G-POEM**: Promising for select refractory patients [^115R8B59] [^111Z92eS].
- **Novel agents**: Ghrelin agonists and other prokinetics under study; none approved [^111qb6SV] [^113WjrPk].

---

Prokinetic therapy is central to gastroparesis management, with **metoclopramide as first-line** and erythromycin or domperidone as alternatives; individualized therapy, regular reassessment, and integration with diet and glycemic control are essential [^116JyUGM].

### The goals for successful development of treatment in gastroparesis [^112bjF4h]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a motility disorder of the stomach characterized by cardinal symptoms and delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of mechanical obstruction. There is significant unmet need in its management, and essentially there are no medications approved for its treatment over four decades.

Purpose

The objectives of this review are to develop an understanding of the goals of treatment, the evidence-based criteria for treatment success based on the current scientific understanding of gastroparesis as well as patient response outcomes, and to propose evidence-based principles for the successful development of treatments for gastroparesis. Specifically, we discuss the pathophysiologic targets in gastroparesis, eligibility criteria for clinical trial participation based on validated gastric emptying studies, and the patient response outcome measures that have been validated to appraise effects of treatment on clinically relevant outcomes. These considerations lead to recommendations regarding eligibility, design, and duration of proof-of-efficacy studies, and to endorsing the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary as a validated patient response outcome and to justification of the shortening of proof-of-efficacy, placebo-controlled clinical trials to 4weeks treatment duration after a baseline period. We believe that such approaches will increase the likelihood of successful assessment of efficacy of novel approaches to treating patients with gastroparesis.

### Prokinetics in gastroparesis [^116dMHEt]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Prokinetic agents are medications that enhance coordinated gastrointestinal motility and transit of content in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly by amplifying and coordinating the gastrointestinal muscular contractions. In addition to dietary therapy, prokinetic therapy should be considered as a means to improve gastric emptying and symptoms of gastroparesis, balancing benefits and risks of treatment. In the United States, metoclopramide remains the first-line prokinetic therapy, because it is the only approved medication for gastroparesis. Newer agents are being developed for the management of gastroparesis. This article provides detailed information about prokinetic agents for the treatment of gastroparesis.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^116JyUGM]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on Management of Gastroparesis — General considerations for implementing treatment recommendations: It is important to optimize glycemic control in individuals with gastroparesis in the setting of diabetes mellitus. It is important to review the patient's current medications to eliminate medications that may alter GI tract motility; medications that can delay gastric emptying include opiate pain medications and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. One should also be cognizant of potential drug-drug interactions when considering pharmacologic interventions. It is important to consider potential coexisting conditions that may contribute to symptoms when treating individuals with gastroparesis. The Guideline Panel Content Experts use dietary interventions with small-particle and low-fat, low-residue diets before initiation of pharmacologic interventions or as a concomitant intervention. Patients with gastroparesis may need to use antiemetics as needed, including selective serotonin receptor (5HT3) antagonists (eg, ondansetron and granisetron), histamine H1 antagonists (eg, promethazine), and/or dopamine D2 antagonists (eg, prochlorperazine). In clinical practice, the Guideline Panel Content Experts assess the efficacy and tolerance of pharmacologic interventions at 4–8 weeks to decide whether the treatment should be continued or adjusted. The recommendations in this document are based on a comparison with no intervention.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^1129CfmE]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Gastroparesis is a complex gastric motility disorder characterized by nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms associated with a delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Variations in diagnostic testing and limited effective treatments make caring for this patient population challenging. The American Gastroenterological Association developed this guideline to provide recommendations for ensuring an accurate diagnosis and identifying evidence-based, effective treatments among the available pharmacologic and procedural interventions for patients with idiopathic gastroparesis or gastroparesis related to diabetes.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and develop this guideline. The Guideline Panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes, conducted an evidence review, and used the Evidence to Decision Framework to develop recommendations.

Results

The Guideline Panel agreed on 12 recommendations. A conditional recommendation was issued against using 2-hour gastric emptying testing and in favor of 4-hour testing in patients with suspected gastroparesis. There are conditional recommendations for the use of metoclopramide and erythromycin in patients with gastroparesis. Conditional recommendations were issued against the use of domperidone, prucalopride, aprepitant, nortriptyline, buspirone, and cannabidiol as first-line therapies. In addition, conditional recommendations were issued against the routine initial use of gastric per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy or gastric electrical stimulation in patients with gastroparesis, reserving these treatments for select patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapies. No recommendation was given regarding the use of surgical pyloromyotomy and surgical pyloroplasty, which were identified as procedures with knowledge gaps in their use for treatment for gastroparesis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires the use of 4-hour gastric emptying tests. Metoclopramide or erythromycin is appropriate for initial pharmacologic treatment. Other treatment recommendations require shared patient-physician decision making. There are still considerable unmet needs in the treatment of gastroparesis.

### Gastroparesis: symptoms, evaluation, and treatment [^113QLoTF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal manifestations in association with objective delays in gastric emptying. The condition may complicate several systemic disorders or may be idiopathic in nature. The diagnosis is made by directed evaluation to exclude organic diseases, which can mimic the clinical presentation of gastroparesis coupled with quantification of gastric emptying. Current therapies rely on dietary modifications, medications to stimulate gastric evacuation, and agents to reduce vomiting. Endoscopic and surgical options are increasingly used for cases refractory to medication treatment.

### New management approaches for gastroparesis [^111inGWo]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with gastroparesis is challenging. Although the syndrome has multiple causes and knowledge of the pathophysiology and natural history is far from complete, a number of common management principles can be applied. The relatively poor correlation between upper-gastrointestinal symptoms and disordered gastric emptying represents a major difficulty in the therapeutic approach, and evidence to support the efficacy of current management strategies is often suboptimal, especially in relation to long-term therapy. In this review, the common causes and pathophysiology of gastroparesis are summarized, the diagnostic approach considered, and the evidence to support medical and surgical therapies reviewed. These therapies include currently available prokinetic drugs, novel medical therapies, and the promising technique of gastric electrical stimulation.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^112yZQ8G]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of precipitating medications, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a review of the patient's current medications to eliminate those that may alter gastrointestinal tract motility. Medications that can delay gastric emptying include opiate pain medications and GLP-1 receptor agonists used for diabetes management and weight loss. Recognize potential drug-drug interactions when considering pharmacologic interventions.

### Rome foundation and international neurogastroenterology and motility societies' consensus on idiopathic gastroparesis [^1144JK9D]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

To establish a consensus on the definition and management of idiopathic gastroparesis, international experts (selected by neurogastroenterology and motility societies and initiated by the Rome Foundation) devised 144 statements using the Delphi method, with at least 80% agreement required. This consensus defined idiopathic gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms. Frequently co-existing symptoms are early satiation and postprandial fullness. Diagnosis requires the presence of these symptoms alongside delayed gastric emptying, measured by a 4 h scintigraphy or gastric emptying breath test of a mixed composition meal in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Therapeutic options with proven efficacy were sparse. Dietary adjustments, nutritional support (per guidelines from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism for substantial weight loss or intractable vomiting), and opioid cessation were recommended by a consensus opinion. Antiemetic and prokinetic agents were also considered potentially beneficial. This consensus offers a global perspective on idiopathic gastroparesis.

### Future directions in the treatment of gastroparesis [^115F5kKh]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding of gastroparesis is evolving, in part because of systematic studies on the pathology, pathophysiology, and outcomes. It is clear that simply accelerating gastric emptying may not effectively control symptoms in this syndrome and more creative approaches are required that address aberrant sensation (vagal and spinal) as well as regional disturbances in motility. Further, with the growing recognition of a possible inflammatory basis, the prospects of disease modifying now seem realistic.

Gastroparesis is a gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying. It is a rare disease and difficult to treat effectively; management is a dilemma for gastroenterologists and surgeons alike. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate current diagnostic tools as well as treatment options. We describe key elements in the pathophysiology of the disease, in addition to current evidence on treatment alternatives, including nutritional considerations, medical and surgical options, and related outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^112Zpd8g]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — erythromycin for gastroparesis states that in individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests using erythromycin (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Erythromycin is thought to improve symptoms of gastroparesis due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than by a direct antiemetic effect, and its effect on symptoms and gastric motility is through motilin receptor agonist properties and is unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Low doses (eg, 40–150 mg by mouth, 30 minutes before meals) are used to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses (250–500 mg), and because tablets are only available in high doses, erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension allows smaller, better tolerated doses. Tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use; in practice, efficacy is maintained using drug holidays (eg, 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy). Safety concerns include development of antibiotic resistance (with long-term use), drug interactions (it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor), and QT prolongation, and azithromycin has been used as a substitute with many of the same safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance also applying.

### ACG clinical guideline: gastroparesis [^113F2ZH4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms suggesting retention of food in the stomach with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction in the gastric outflow. This condition is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. These guidelines summarize perspectives on the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis in adults (including dietary, pharmacological, device, and interventions directed at the pylorus), and they represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. When the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, we used expert consensus to develop key concept statements. These guidelines should be considered as preferred but are not the only approaches to these conditions.

### Targeting treatment of gastroparesis: use of clinical tests to guide treatments [^1148XFso]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis presents with nausea, vomiting, and other upper gut symptoms, and is diagnosed by confirming delayed gastric emptying. A related condition, chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting, has similar symptoms but with normal emptying. Both conditions are managed using therapies with diverse mechanisms of action. Even though prokinetic treatments are proposed to improve gastroparesis by accelerating gastric emptying, there is limited evidence that they provide benefit by virtue of transit stimulating effects. Other tests can delineate alterations in other gut sensorimotor parameters in patients with suspected gastroparesis, but their relation to symptoms and their capability to guide treatment are largely unproved.

### United European Gastroenterology (UEG) and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) consensus on gastroparesis [^111iLXk7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by epigastric symptoms and delayed gastric emptying (GE) rate in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. The condition is challenging in clinical practice by the lack of guidance concerning diagnosis and management of gastroparesis.

Methods

A Delphi consensus was undertaken by 40 experts from 19 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 89 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as ≥ 80% agreement) was reached for 25 statements.

Results

The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, with often coexisting postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. The true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not known in detail, but diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs recognized as risk factors. While the panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients, there was no consensus on underlying pathophysiology. The panel agreed that an upper endoscopy and a GE test are required for diagnosis. Only dietary therapy, dopamine-2 antagonists and 5-HT 4 receptor agonists were considered appropriate therapies, in addition to nutritional support in case of severe weight loss. No consensus was reached on the use of proton pump inhibitors, other classes of antiemetics or prokinetics, neuromodulators, complimentary, psychological, or more invasive therapies. Finally, there was consensus that gastroparesis adversely impacts on quality of life and healthcare costs and that the long-term prognosis of gastroparesis depends on the cause.

Conclusions and Inferences

A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on definition, symptom characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis.

### Drug-drug interactions in pharmacologic management of gastroparesis [^1117gK2x]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying due to chronic abnormal gastric motility. The treatment of the disease often entails the co-administration of several classes of pharmacological agents. These agents may be metabolized via the same pathway. Inhibition or induction of a shared metabolic pathway leads to change in the systemic levels of prescribed drugs, possibly leading to undesired clinical outcomes.

Purpose

This review discusses different pharmacological treatment for gastroparesis patients and describes the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in some of the combinations that are currently used. Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide and domperidone are the cornerstone in treatment of gastroparesis. Antiemetic agents such as promethazine and ondansetron are frequently administered to gastroparesis patients to reduce nausea and vomiting. Gastroparesis is prevalent in diabetic patients and therefore antidiabetic agents are also prescribed. Many of these co-administered drugs are metabolized via common drug metabolizing enzymes and this can trigger potential DDIs. The scientific literature was reviewed from the years 1975–2014 for original research articles and reviews that evaluated DDIs in gastroparesis. Many commonly prescribed combinations were predicted to cause potential DDIs in gastroparesis patients. This review will help inform about potential hazardous combinations. This information will hopefully lead to less adverse effects and more successful gastroparesis management.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114JKnxP]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Executive summary — Definition and approved therapy describes gastroparesis as a disorder of gastric motility defined by a demonstrable delay in gastric emptying associated with a constellation of upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the absence of mechanical obstruction, and notes that to date, there is only 1 treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for gastroparesis (ie, metoclopramide).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114GAPbt]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering metoclopramide in patients with GP.
Discuss potential adverse effects of metoclopramide with patients before initiating treatment. The FDA has issued a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Recognize that patients on psychotropic agents and older patients may be at higher risk for adverse events leading to discontinuation, although the absolute risk is low, including the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Initiate typical dosing with the oral formulation at 5 mg before meals, which can be increased up to 10 mg before meals. For intranasal metoclopramide, administer 15 mg before meals and at bedtime. Consider using practices to improve tolerability, such as starting at a low dose and implementing 1–4 weeks of drug holidays every 8–12 weeks. Assess medication efficacy and adverse effects, including movement disorders, at 4–8 weeks to determine whether to continue treatment. Monitor efficacy and adverse effects for the duration of metoclopramide therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^113WjrPk]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Methods — Scope — Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric motility defined by a measurable delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction and is associated with a constellation of upper GI symptoms. Cardinal symptoms include nausea and vomiting, which may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and bloating. To date, there is only 1 FDA-approved agent for the treatment of gastroparesis (ie, metoclopramide) and many agents in the pipeline have failed to show meaningful benefit over placebo. New procedural approaches — including gastric per oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) — are nonetheless emerging alongside the existing pharmacologic treatments. Despite diagnostic challenges, gastroparesis has a high prevalence, estimated to be between 21.5 and 24.2 cases per 100,000 people, with a disproportionate impact on women.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical guideline: management of gastroparesis [^115Sixjh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through the recognition of the clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms from gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. Management of gastroparesis should include assessment and correction of nutritional state, relief of symptoms, improvement of gastric emptying and, in diabetics, glycemic control. Patient nutritional state should be managed by oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is not adequate, then enteral nutrition via jejunostomy tube needs to be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained. Medical treatment entails use of prokinetic and antiemetic therapies. Current approved treatment options, including metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical need. Antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis, but they may relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications, and include domperidone, erythromycin (primarily over a short term), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators. GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency, and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include venting gastrostomy or feeding jejunostomy; intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection was not effective in randomized controlled trials. Most of these treatments are based on open-label treatment trials and small numbers. Partial gastrectomy and pyloroplasty should be used rarely, only in carefully selected patients. Attention should be given to the development of new effective therapies for symptomatic control.

### Azithromycin for the treatment of gastroparesis [^111Gp8L6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of azithromycin for the treatment of gastroparesis.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science (both 1966-October 2012) using the terms gastroparesis, diabetic gastroparesis, and azithromycin. Literature was limited to English-language publications. In addition, references from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in English identified from the data sources were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the symptoms, but generally includes dietary modifications, prokinetic medications, and antiemetics. The initial treatment for gastroparesis is a prokinetic agent, and because erythromycin has the greatest effect on gastric emptying, it is often used. Limitations to erythromycin include adverse reactions (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), QTc interval prolongation, CYP3A-associated drug interactions, and tachyphylaxis. Azithromycin, another macrolide, has been shown to increase gastrointestinal motility and may have fewer limitations to its use. Azithromycin has fewer drug interactions, less incidence of QTc interval prolongation, a longer half-life, and fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects. Use of azithromycin may be beneficial in patients with gastric and small bowel dysmotility. Two observational studies have supported its use in gastroparesis, but there have been no controlled studies. All studies published have been performed during testing procedures for gastroparesis; thus, longer-term treatment effects and symptom control need to be studied. There is one ongoing prospective controlled trial with preliminary data available only in abstract form.

Conclusions

Azithromycin may prove to be an alternative prokinetic agent in gastroparesis, but further study is needed before it can be recommended.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^115R8B59]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Delayed gastric emptying on objective testing defines gastroparesis, but symptoms overlap with functional dyspepsia and do not correlate well with gastric emptying delay. The Best Practice Advice statements presented here were developed from review of existing literature combined with expert opinion to provide practical advice, and because this was not a systematic review, formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was not performed. Clinicians should review symptoms and evaluate physical examination findings to exclude disorders that can mimic medically refractory gastroparesis. Clinicians should verify appropriate methodology of the gastric emptying study to ensure an accurate diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying. Clinicians should counsel and classify patients with gastroparesis into mild, moderate, or severe based on symptoms and the results of a properly performed gastric emptying study. Clinicians should identify the predominant symptom and initiate treatment based on that symptom. Clinicians should be aware of the multiple treatment options to treat nausea and vomiting. Clinicians should consider the use of neuromodulators to treat gastroparesis associated abdominal pain but should not use opioids. Clinicians can consider gastric electrical stimulation for gastroparesis patients with refractory/intractable nausea and vomiting who have failed standard therapy and are not on opioids. Clinicians can consider G-POEM for select refractory gastroparesis patients with severe delay in gastric emptying, using a thoughtful team approach involving motility specialists and advanced endoscopists at a center of excellence.

### Gastroparesis [^117KNH2G]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroparesis is a common disorder that produces symptoms of gastric retention in the absence of physical obstruction. Extensive research into the clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy of gastroparesis in the past several years has offered insight into the condition. This review provides updated information on gastroparesis focusing on new findings from the past few years.

Recent Findings

Large database studies have characterized clinical profiles in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis and are defining roles of gastric and extragastric factors in symptom genesis. Dietary deficiencies in gastroparesis have been clarified. Histologic study of full thickness gastric tissue in severe gastroparesis shows heterogeneous enteric neuronal, smooth muscle, interstitial cell, and inflammatory abnormalities. Advances in gastric emptying testing include wireless motility capsules and nonradioactive breath tests. The importance of glycemic control in diabetic gastroparesis is a focus of current investigation. Novel therapies include new prokinetics (ghrelin agonists), increased focus on antiemetic agents including antidepressants, and next generation gastric stimulators. Studies are being initiated to delineate the natural history of gastroparesis.

Summary

Much has been learned recently on the causes, clinical presentations, and management of gastroparesis. Current ongoing investigation provides promise for further gains in the years ahead.

Metoclopramide for gastroparesis — Larger and more recent studies, including those using the intranasal formulation, showed a statistically significant benefit over placebo, and treatment with metoclopramide is indicated over no metoclopramide; however, because of the FDA black box warning and the recommendation to prescribe for only up to 12 weeks, the panel noted implementation and acceptability concerns. The absolute risk of tardive dyskinesia with metoclopramide use is described as low, with prescription database studies estimating prevalences of 1 in 17,800 and 1 in approximately 35,000 prescriptions, and a 2019 review estimating a risk in the range of 0.1% to 1.0% per 1000 patient-years. Increased risk of adverse events leading to discontinuation may be seen more often in older individuals or those on psychotropic agents. The Guideline Panel Content Experts usually assess efficacy at 4–8 weeks to decide on continuation, and since the FDA suggested treatment duration of 3 months, many clinicians give a drug holiday of 1 week to 1 month to determine whether further treatment is needed. One database study reported continuous use for a median duration of 490 days.

### Basic and clinical pharmacology of new motility promoting agents [^113UmW9f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Recent research has provided new information about drugs that could be used to treat functional motility disorders. Promotility drugs accelerate gastric emptying or colonic transit and these properties may contribute to their efficacy in treating symptoms associated with gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia or constipation. 5-Hydroxytryptamine4 receptors are targets for drugs (tegaserod, renzapride) that treat symptoms in constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients and in gastroparesis. Drugs acting at motilin (erythromycin) and cholecystokinin-1 (dexloxiglumide) receptors accelerate gastric emptying. Dexloxiglumide might be useful in the treatment of functional dyspepsia particularly that associated with lipid intake. Alvimopan is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier. Alvimopan is effective in treating postsurgical ileus and perhaps opiate-induced bowel dysfunction. Successes and failures of recent efforts to develop promotility agents revealed opportunities and challenges for developing new promotility drugs. The pharmacological properties of partial agonists might be exploited to develop effective promotility drugs. However, opposing actions of promotility agents on motility (increased contraction vs decreased accommodation) limit the clinical efficacy of drugs with these opposing actions. Selection of appropriate patient populations for evaluation of new drugs is also critical.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^113o95wf]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy — general considerations: A patient is considered to have gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy if they have cardinal symptoms of gastroparesis (ie, nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, and/or early satiety) as the predominant symptoms, in addition to evidence of delayed gastric emptying with no alternative explanation for the symptoms, and have failed at least 2 medical treatments, including prokinetic and antiemetic agents. In patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy, it is important to ascertain the accuracy of the diagnosis and to evaluate for coexisting conditions that may be causing or contributing to the severity of the predominant symptoms. The management of gastroparesis that is refractory to medical therapy requires a multidisciplinary approach that optimally involves the primary care provider, a gastroenterologist, and a registered dietitian, in addition to an endocrinologist in patients with diabetes; in select cases, this might also involve an interventional endoscopist and a foregut surgeon. It is important to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy and to provide nutritional support, preferably orally as tolerated.

### Diabetic gastroparesis [^116ULtD7]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Gastro-Friendly Management

The management strategy of diabetic gastroparesis is multifactorial. A careful drug history must be taken to exclude prescription, over the counter, and alternative medicine drugs, as well as nutritional supplements which may worsen gastric motility. In particular, the need for prescribing proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor blockers must be reassessed in a person with gastroparesis. In a disorder of gastric motility, the drug of choice should be a prokinetic agent, and not an antacid or acid-suppressing drug. Fixed dose combinations of these drug classes serve as a Trojan horse which prevents correction of gastroparesis, leads to poor glycemic control with high variability, and sets in motion a vicious cycle of complications and poor outcomes.

### Expert consensus document: advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^1169Hx9a]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Disturbances of gastric and intestinal motor functions such as gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, enteric dysmotility, IBS and constipation affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life and cause considerable health-care costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Comprehensive consensus papers published in 2008 (REF.) and 2011 (REF.) detailed how to evaluate and interpret gastric, small intestinal and colonic motility by intraluminal measurements and transit tests in clinical practice.

Advances in diagnostic techniques for the evaluation of gastrointestinal motor function necessitate an update about indications for and selection and performance of currently available tests, how motility disorders can be differentiated and classified based on these tests and how the results guide treatment decisions, as noted in this Consensus Statement. A panel of international motility experts has re-examined these issues and provides concise information on test principles, practical performance and interpretation of individual tests (BOX 1). Further details on these topics will be provided in technical position statements that will be published separately.

### Gastroparesis [^114qBdoJ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of a mechanical obstruction of the stomach, resulting in the cardinal symptoms of early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, belching and bloating. Gastroparesis is now recognized as part of a broader spectrum of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction that includes impaired gastric accommodation. The overlap between upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes the distinction between gastroparesis and other disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, challenging. Thus, a confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis requires measurement of delayed gastric emptying via an appropriate test, such as gastric scintigraphy or breath testing. Gastroparesis can have idiopathic, diabetic, iatrogenic, post-surgical or post-viral aetiologies. The management of gastroparesis involves: correcting fluid, electrolyte and nutritional deficiencies; identifying and treating the cause of delayed gastric emptying (for example, diabetes mellitus); and suppressing or eliminating symptoms with pharmacological agents as first-line therapies. Several novel pharmacologic agents and interventions are currently in the pipeline and show promise to help tailor individualized therapy for patients with gastroparesis.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^116hAjrb]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroparesis — prokinetic therapy with metoclopramide: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests using metoclopramide. As part of shared decision making, patients who place a higher value on the potential risk of adverse events and lower value on the symptomatic improvement may reasonably select not to use metoclopramide. Implementation considerations state that potential adverse effects of metoclopramide should be discussed before starting treatment, the FDA issued a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia, and patients on psychotropic agents and older individuals may be at higher risk for adverse events leading to discontinuation, but the absolute risk is low, including the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Typical dosing with the oral formulation starts with 5 mg before meals, which can be increased up to 10 mg before meals; for intranasal metoclopramide, the dose is 15 mg before meals and at bedtime. Practices to improve tolerability include starting at low dose and using 1–4 weeks drug holidays every 8–12 weeks. Medication efficacy and adverse effects, including movement disorders, are usually assessed at 4–8 weeks to decide whether to continue, and then monitored for the duration of treatment.

### Gastroduodenal motility disorders [^117Qvut5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent progress in the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of gastroduodenal motility disorders with an emphasis on functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis.

Recent Findings

Pathophysiological research has focused on the association of delayed emptying and impaired accommodation with symptom pattern. Studies also confirmed the presence of altered mucosal integrity and low-grade immune activation in the duodenum in functional dyspepsia, while changes in numbers of interstitial cells of Cajal and myenteric neurons were confirmed in gastroparesis. Treatment advances in gastroparesis include new prokinetics such as the ghrelin receptor agonist relamorelin and the antiemetic agent aprepitant. The efficacy and use of neuromodulators were reviewed and new management guidelines for functional dyspepsia were published.

Summary

Pathophysiological research has focused on cellular changes in gastroparesis and gastroduodenal motility disorders. New treatments include relamorelin and aprepitant for gastroparesis.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: therapeutic options [^115ibbzw]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying and the most common known underlying cause is diabetes mellitus. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal fullness, and early satiety, which impact to varying degrees on the patient's quality of life. Symptoms and deficits do not necessarily relate to each other, hence despite significant abnormalities in gastric emptying, some individuals have only minimal symptoms and, conversely, severe symptoms do not always relate to measures of gastric emptying. Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin enhance gastric motility and have remained the mainstay of treatment for several decades, despite unwanted side effects and numerous drug interactions. Mechanical therapies such as endoscopic pyloric botulinum toxin injection, gastric electrical stimulation, and gastrostomy or jejunostomy are used in intractable diabetic gastroparesis (DG), refractory to prokinetic therapies. Mitemcinal and TZP-101 are novel investigational motilin receptor and ghrelin agonists, respectively, and show promise in the treatment of DG. The aim of this review is to provide an update on prokinetic and mechanical therapies in the treatment of DG.

Background

Prokinetics are a class of pharmacological drugs designed to improve gastrointestinal (GI) motility, either regionally or across the whole gut. Each drug has its merits and drawbacks, and based on current evidence as high-quality studies are limited, we have no clear recommendation on one class or other. However, there remains a large unmet need for both regionally selective and/or globally acting prokinetic drugs that work primarily intraluminally and are safe and without systemic side effects.

Purpose

Here, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of six classes of prokinetic drugs, including their pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, safety and tolerability and potential indications.

Gastroparesis refers to chronically abnormal gastric motility characterized by symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It may be idiopathic or attributable to neuropathic or myopathic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, postvagotomy, postviral infection, and scleroderma. Dietary and behavioral modification, prokinetic drugs, and surgical interventions have been used in managing patients with gastroparesis. Although mild gastroparesis is usually well managed with these treatment options, severe gastroparesis may be very difficult to control and may require referral to a specialist center if symptoms are intractable despite pharmacological therapy and dietetic support. New advances in drug therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. This article critically reviews the advances in the field from the perspective of the clinician.

Prucalopride — evidence, benefits/harms, and certainty in adults with gastroparesis are as follows: Evidence informing the recommendation to use prucalopride was derived from 2 crossover RCTs that compared prucalopride with placebo in individuals with gastroparesis, including one study limited to idiopathic gastroparesis and another limited to diabetes mellitus or mixed connective tissue disease, and overall the trials were at low risk for bias. Prucalopride produced score reductions that, however, did not meet the threshold for clinical importance, and there was an increased risk of serious adverse effects observed and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment. The overall CoE was very low, rated down for serious risk of bias and serious to very serious imprecision, and publication bias was not suspected. Of the 2 studies, the trial focused on idiopathic gastroparesis showed favorable results, whereas the study involving primarily diabetes-related gastroparesis did not. Prucalopride is currently approved for use in CIC and works exclusively as a promotility agent; although the included RCTs revealed significant improvements, when judged on the basis of meaningful improvement they did not reach a predefined threshold of clinical significance. The recommendation acknowledges that many patients with symptom improvement had idiopathic gastroparesis, and it is possible that some patients — especially with coexisting constipation — would reasonably elect to treat both conditions with 1 medication; prucalopride has been associated with reports of depression and suicidal thoughts/behavior, particularly in the initial weeks, and whether specific counseling is needed is unknown, as there has been no evidence of a causal association between prucalopride treatment and these outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^111PgDh5]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Aprepitant for gastroparesis shows limited benefit; the trial included 126 patients, but only 57% had delayed gastric emptying. Compared with placebo, measured symptom changes did not represent clinically important reductions based on the predefined MIDs thresholds, although abdominal pain had a clinically important reduction; serious adverse events and discontinuations were not major issues when receiving aprepitant. The overall CoE was low. The AGA Panel suggested against the use of aprepitant for first-line management of gastroparesis due to its small benefit in producing clinically meaningful reductions in nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is available in both oral and intravenous forms, but access to its use for management of gastroparesis can be difficult due to limited insurance coverage and its high cost. Although 2 clinical trials evaluated tradipitant, they were not used in developing the recommendation because it has not yet been approved by the FDA and is not presently available.

### Expert consensus document: advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

- The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients.

Because accelerated, normal and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement of clearly delayed gastric emptying (gastric emptying time increased above the upper level of normal) using well-validated techniques such as gastric emptying scintigraphy (FIG. 1) is required for diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and a better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition (for example, > 3 standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers).

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned because of variations in the reports of association between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past 7 years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times –. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For example, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, one systematic literature review that used multiple methods, various symptom instruments and diverse treatments showed that most drugs that improved idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis failed to show a statistically significant relationship with the degree of symptom improvement and acceleration of gastric emptying across studies.

Some groups have observed that the association between clinical improvement and acceleration of gastric emptying depends on the aetiology of gastroparesis, which could partly explain inconsistent findings across studies. Moreover, the modes of action of drugs used for acceleration of gastric emptying are extremely heterogeneous and potentially induce dysfunctions that cause symptoms. For example, motilin receptor agonists markedly accelerate gastric emptying but simultaneously impair gastric accommodation and can induce dyspeptic symptoms. Several additional factors other than a global delay in gastric emptying — such as antral distension, antral hypomotility, gastric dysrhythmias, visceral hypersensitivity or psychological disturbances — could explain, in part, the symptoms experienced by patients with gastroparesis.

- In patients with upper gastrointestinal surgery, diagnosis of dumping syndrome can be made on the basis of typical symptoms and findings such as post prandial hypoglycaemia or hypotension. In unclear cases, provocation tests that prove dumping syndrome are the basis of diagnosis, which is supported by evidence of accelerated gastric emptying, preferably of liquids.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: therapeutic options [^115fkxqu]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Management

Key principles in the treatment of DG are the correction of exacerbating factors, which include regulation of glycemia, adequate nutritional support, and the use of prokinetic therapies, which have formed the cornerstone of treatment for DG. The aim of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, shorten gastric emptying time, improve the nutritional status of the patient, and thus optimize glycemic control. As previously discussed, hyperglycemia itself may delay gastric emptying and adequate control of glycemia is recognized as an important facet in the management of DG. However, there is little evidence to indicate that prokinetic agents may improve glycemic control through improved gastric emptying.

### Oral erythromycin and symptomatic relief of gastroparesis: a systematic review [^1152oWDy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Erythromycin is a motilin agonist that greatly increases the fractional rate of gastric emptying. Although a number of studies document the efficacy of erythromycin in improving gastric emptying, little information exists concerning symptom improvement in patients with gastroparesis. The aim of this study was to review clinical trials of erythromycin to determine the efficacy of this agent in producing symptom relief in patients with gastroparesis.

Methods

A MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2001 was performed to identify all clinical trials using erythromycin in patients with gastroparesis. The search was further limited to clinical trials using symptom assessment as an endpoint. References from index citations were reviewed to identify additional studies. The search was conducted independently by two authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus opinion.

Results

Thirty-five clinical trials were identified, and five met inclusion criteria. One study each involved gastroparesis caused by surgery and systemic sclerosis. Three studies evaluated patients with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis. No study used symptoms as a primary endpoint. Improvement was reported in 26 of 60 (43%) patients. Individual symptom scores were available for 23 of 60 subjects in these studies, and symptom improvement was seen in 11 of 23 (48%) patients. One study compared erythromycin and metoclopromide in an open-label, crossover fashion, and found no difference between the two agents. All studies were methodologically weak and highly subject to bias. Four of five studies were open-label trials. Sample sizes in all studies were ≤ 13 subjects, and treatment duration was ≤ 4 wk in all studies.

Conclusions

Although clearly a potent prokinetic, limited data exist concerning efficacy of erythromycin in treating gastroparesis. Small sample sizes, uncontrolled designs, short duration, and inadequate symptom assessment limit available studies. Well-designed trials designed to assess symptom relief in gastroparesis are needed.

### Access options for withdrawn motility-modifying agents [^113w3irv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians caring for patients with motility or functional digestive diorders often decry the unhappy state of prokinetic therapy. There appears to be a paucity of agents brought to market and several of the agents felt to be truly efficacious have been withdrawn. While treatment options remain limited, the scenario may not be as bleak as initially thought. Treatment options are available particularly if practitioners are willing to pursue alternative prescribing approaches. This article describes mechanisms by which physicians may safely obtain prokinetic agents commonly regarded as inaccessible.

### Current treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis: antiemetics, prokinetics, tricyclics [^112jHPmH]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a symptomatic chronic disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying without a mechanical obstruction. Gastroparesis is most often associated with diabetes, gastric surgery, and systemic disorders affecting the neuromuscular control of the stomach. However, no underlying etiology can be found in up to 40% of patients, a condition referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis. Due to the numerous potential etiologies and the highly variable clinical manifestations, the management of gastroparesis is particularly challenging. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the use of antiemetics, prokinetics, and tricyclics for the treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis.

Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant) — AGA recommendation for gastroparesis: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests against the use of aprepitant as a first-line treatment (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). As part of shared decision making, patients who place a higher value on the potential improvement in nausea and vomiting and lower value on the potential adverse effects may reasonably elect to use aprepitant. Implementation considerations state that aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, is an antiemetic approved for chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but has no effect on gastric motor function, and that aprepitant may be helpful in patients with gastroparesis and nausea/vomiting in whom 5HT 3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, and other antiemetics are not helpful. Evidence informing this recommendation was derived from 1 clinical trial comparing aprepitant with placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of drugs for gastroparesis: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116GYo4c]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although there have been multiple drugs tested in gastroparesis, their relative efficacy and safety are unknown. We evaluated this in a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We searched the literature to September 7, 2022. We judged the efficacy of drugs based on global symptoms of gastroparesis; individual symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, or fullness; and safety according to total adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal. We extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment failures and reporting pooled relative risks (RRs) of not improving with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), ranking drugs according to P-score.

Results

We identified 29 RCTs (3772 patients). Based on global symptoms, clebopride ranked first for efficacy (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16–0.57; P-score = .99) followed by domperidone (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.98; P-score = .76). No other drug was superior to placebo. Only 2 drug classes were efficacious: in rank order, oral dopamine antagonists (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77; P-score = .96) and tachykinin-1 antagonists (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.93; P-score = .83). For individual symptoms, oral metoclopramide ranked first for nausea (RR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21–1.00; P-score = .95), fullness (RR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35–1.28; P-score = .86), and bloating (RR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30–0.93; P-score = .97), based on only 1 small trial. Only prucalopride was more likely to be associated with adverse events than placebo.

Conclusions

In a network meta-analysis, oral dopamine antagonists and tachykinin-1 antagonists were more efficacious than placebo for gastroparesis, but confidence in the evidence was low to moderate for most comparisons. There is an unmet need for efficacious therapies for gastroparesis.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113hxNJ9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Medically refractory gastroparesis — electrolyte derangements are common in patients with persistent nausea and vomiting and should be corrected, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level can be checked if hypothyroidism is a concern. Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis may indicate adrenal insufficiency, which can be initially evaluated by measuring a fasting cortisol level. Upper endoscopy should be performed to rule out an organic cause of symptoms. Gastric emptying can be measured by using several techniques (scintigraphy, 13Cspirulina breath test, wireless motility capsule); most U.S. centers perform gastric scintigraphy, albeit often incorrectly with short measurement times, leading to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Joint American Nuclear Medicine Society and American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society guidelines outline key protocol requirements for performing an accurate 4-hour test; optimally performed off opioid medication. Repeating scintigraphy may change the pathophysiological and diagnostic categorization from gastroparesis to FD and vice versa in as many as 37%-42% within the course of a year. A careful history, thoughtful physical examination, and prudent diagnostic tests can distinguish conditions that mimic refractory gastroparesis, with important physical examination findings including a succussion splash, a bruit on auscultation of the right upper quadrant, digital ulcers and telangiectasia, and ascites, a mass or enlarged lymph nodes. Because there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies comparing different management strategies (eg, a central anti-emetic vs a prokinetic agent), initiating treatment based on the predominant presenting symptom is a reasonable first approach. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the black box warning associated with metoclopramide use, although the risk of tardive dyskinesia from chronic metoclopramide use may be lower than previously estimated by regulatory authorities. Because the wireless motility capsule, an inanimate object, identifies the phase III activity front of the migrating motor complex rather than overall gastric emptying, a meal-based test provides better physiological assessment of gastric emptying.

Nortriptyline as a neuromodulator in gastroparesis — the AGA suggests against the use of nortriptyline as a first-line treatment (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). As part of shared decision making, patients who place a higher value on potential improvement in early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and quality of life and a lower value on potential adverse effects may reasonably elect to use nortriptyline. Implementation considerations state that patients with overlapping irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia (epigastric pain syndrome), or significant abdominal pain associated with gastroparesis may benefit from the use of tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline; when using tricyclic antidepressants in patients with gastroparesis, the panel members use agents with fewer anticholinergic effects, such as nortriptyline, and start at low doses and increase slowly to ensure tolerance; and the Guideline Panel Context Experts inform patients that in gastroparesis nortriptyline is being used as a peripheral neuromodulator to reduce afferent sensory transmission to the central nervous system.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^112Fe3Z4]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid using domperidone as a first-line treatment in patients with GP.
Recognize that domperidone may be especially helpful for patients with GP who experienced neurologic adverse effects with metoclopramide, for patients with neurologic movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and for patients declining metoclopramide due to concerns about adverse effects. Be aware that domperidone is not approved by the FDA in the US for human use. Prescribing domperidone requires an expanded access use investigational new drug application from the FDA. Note that the current supplier for domperidone for the FDA investigational new drug in the US is exiting the business and will no longer supply the medication. Obtain blood work for serum potassium and magnesium and perform an ECG at baseline to measure the QTc interval before starting treatment with domperidone. Assess the efficacy of domperidone at 4–8 weeks to decide whether to continue treatment. Monitor serum potassium, magnesium, and ECG QTc interval while the patient is treated with domperidone.

### Endoscopic treatment modalities for the management of gastroparesis: a critical review [^114jvzhH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

Despite recent advances in the understanding and treatment of gastroparesis, this disorder remains associated with considerable morbidity for patients. Moreover, it poses a significant problem for the healthcare system, given the frequent hospitalizations and the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy and prescription. Currently, numerous endoscopic procedures are available for patients who are unresponsive to pharmacological therapy, with G-POEM showing the most compelling data among them. However, heterogeneity in study characteristics, particularly in patient selection, has resulted in inconsistencies in reported outcomes and, along with the lack of randomized trials and the limited durability of some procedures (e.g. botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilatation), has hindered the widespread adoption of these techniques. Moreover, technical aspects, such as the lack of standardization and the high level of expertise required specifically for G-POEM and EUS-GE, represent additional concerns that must be addressed to enable the broader implementation of these interventions. Future research should focus on better elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for gastroparesis, allowing the application of targeted therapies tailored to the specific mechanisms in each patient. Finally, further comparative studies are essential to provide a clearer understanding of the efficacy and outcomes of different endoscopic interventions.

### Botulinum toxin for the treatment of gastroparesis: a preliminary report [^1142ShGF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric motility that results in delayed gastric emptying. Common symptoms include early satiety, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. The underlying etiologies of gastroparesis are many and include diabetes, prior gastric surgery, collagen vascular disorders, and a previous viral illness. Up to one third of cases are classified as idiopathic. Treatment typically consists of a change in diet to small volume, frequent meals and the use of the prokinetic agents metoclopramide, cisapride, erythromycin, or domperidone. Botulinum toxin has recently been shown to be effective in treating disorders of smooth muscle hypertonicity in the GI tract. This case report describes three patients with severe gastroparesis whose symptoms persisted despite dietary changes and the use of high dose prokinetic agents. All three were treated with intrasphincteric injection of the pylorus with botulinum toxin and all had significant symptomatic improvement afterwards. Possible mechanisms of action of botulinum toxin on the pylorus and its effects in patients with gastroparesis are discussed.

### Ghrelin signaling in the gut, its physiological properties, and therapeutic potential [^111qb6SV]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone secreted from the stomach, was soon after its discovery hypothesized to be a prokinetic agent, due to its homology to motilin. Studies in animals and humans, using ghrelin and ghrelin receptor agonists, confirmed this hypothesis, suggesting a therapeutic potential for the ghrelin receptor in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Precilinical studies demonstrated that ghrelin can act directly on ghrelin receptors on the enteric nervous system, but the predominant route of action under physiological circumstances is signaling via the vagus nerve in the upper gastrointestinal tract and the pelvic nerves in the colon. Different pharmaceutical companies have designed stable ghrelin mimetics that revealed promising results in trials for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and post-operative ileus. Nevertheless, no drug was able to reach the market so far, facing problems proving superiority over placebo treatment in larger trials.

Purpose

This review aims to summarize the road that led to the current knowledge concerning the prokinetic properties of ghrelin with a focus on the therapeutic potential of ghrelin receptor agonists in the treatment of hypomotility disorders. In addition, we outline some of the problems that could be at the basis of the negative outcome of the trials with ghrelin agonists and question whether the right target groups were selected. It is clear that a new approach is needed to develop marketable drugs with this class of gastroprokinetic agents.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: a retrospective analysis [^112G55SN]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Key points

Symptom management of gastroparesis is challenging, due to an incomplete understanding and limited therapeutic options. About 30% of patients eventually need enteral feeding.
Following a stepwise treatment approach (including diet and prokinetics, Gastric Rest, PEG‐J) in gastroparesis, adequate symptom response was reached in 86% of all patients, whereas weight gain was achieved in all patients, independent of symptom response.
The burden of this disorder on individuals and society is considerable and might be relieved by a stepwise approach.

In addition, acute 56 hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric emptying and decrease the effects of prokinetic 57 drugs. 58 59 The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, vomiting (68 to 88. 71 gastroparesis, a finding of DGE in the absence of an obstruction or alternative diagnosis provides 72 critical support for the diagnosis of gastroparesis and can be assessed using either gastric 73 emptying scintigraphy, the gastric emptying breath test, or the SmartPill motility testing system. 95 in phase 3 trials. We encourage early and regular discussions with FDA regarding the 96 development of these PRO instruments. 97 98 Because gastroparesis manifests as more than one core sign or symptom, the effect of new drugs 99 intended to treat gastroparesis on each core sign and symptom should be assessed. Early phase. 104 remaining signs or symptoms of gastroparesis.

For example, a drug may be expected to improve 105 gastroparesis-related nausea and vomiting but not abdominal pain based on its mechanism of 106 action. In this scenario, clinical studies should demonstrate that nausea and vomiting improved 107. and that the treatment did not worsen the symptoms of abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, and 108 early satiety. 109 110 The following sections provide recommendations regarding trial design, trial populations, 111 outcome assessment measures, trial endpoints, and statistical considerations. 112 113 A. 211 endpoint should be based on patients' core signs and symptoms or a subset of them. Gastric 212 emptying time should not be used as a primary efficacy endpoint because changes in gastric 213 emptying time are not associated with the changes in the clinically important signs and 214 symptoms in patients with gastroparesis.

247 proposed mechanism of action of the drug and trial objectives, a proposed threshold can specify 248 some level of improvement in each of the five core signs and symptoms, or it can specify some 249 level of improvement in a subset of those core signs and symptoms. Worsening of core signs.
