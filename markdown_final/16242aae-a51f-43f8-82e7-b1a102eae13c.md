## Question

Treatment for lumbar compression fractures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment approach for lumbar compression fractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and scope. Then, I should assess the natural history and baseline risk to anchor expectations. Next, I will examine the evidence for conservative therapy and identify the best-supported options. After that, I should evaluate vertebral augmentation procedures and resolve the apparent contradictions in the literature. Then, I need to set clear criteria for escalation and consider special populations and risk factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and ensure the osteoporosis disease-modifying therapy is integrated throughout the care pathway.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope. Lumbar compression fractures in adults are overwhelmingly due to osteoporosis and are defined as vertebral body compression resulting from decreased bone density, which may or may not be symptomatic or associated with deformity or neurologic deficit; I need to ensure we exclude traumatic or neoplastic etiologies where the management differs, so I should confirm the diagnosis with plain radiographs and use MRI to distinguish acute from chronic and to screen for malignancy when indicated [^1151FMqu] [^112uncyA].

> Next, I should review the natural history to set expectations. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Even with conservative care, approximately one third of patients will have persistent pain beyond 6 months, with a Grade B recommendation, so I need to counsel patients realistically about timelines and the possibility of chronic pain despite optimal nonoperative care [^115nUdY9]. I should also double-check refracture risk; there is about a 19% risk of new vertebral fractures after an index osteoporotic compression fracture, reinforcing the need for aggressive osteoporosis management even if the fracture pain improves [^114eGd1k].

> I will now examine conservative management. Wait, let me verify bracing guidance. NASS suggests bracing may be considered but there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific brace, and Level II data show rigid custom braces do not outperform soft braces for pain, quality of life, or deformity prevention, so I should avoid routine rigid bracing and instead use a simple, comfortable orthosis or no brace depending on pain and function [^113WRvda] [^116P19H5]. I need to check pharmacologic pain control. A 2024 JAMA Network Open network meta-analysis indicates calcitonin and NSAIDs improve short-term pain during activity, whereas teriparatide outperforms bisphosphonates for long-term pain, but calcitonin's adverse effects limit routine use, so NSAIDs and teriparatide emerge as preferred options within a multimodal plan, and I should remember that the certainty is low for braces with no long-term superiority demonstrated over no brace [^113Setnq] [^112V9LQp] [^112qBGas]. But wait, what if calcitonin is contraindicated or unavailable? Given safety concerns, I should prioritize NSAIDs and consider teriparatide when appropriate and accessible, documenting the rationale for off-label pain control use in this context [^113Setnq].

> Now, I should evaluate vertebral augmentation. Initially, I thought vertebroplasty was broadly not recommended based on high-quality placebo-controlled RCTs, which show no clinically important benefit over sham, and that kyphoplasty was likewise not recommended in high-quality occupational medicine guidelines; hold on, I should verify how to reconcile this with interventional guidance and meta-analyses suggesting benefit [^114fGVG1] [^113WQkxz]. The NASS 2025 guideline, informed by newer comparative evidence, gives vertebral augmentation a Grade A recommendation for rapid and sustained pain and function improvement in acute osteoporotic compression fractures, particularly kyphoplasty, which shows more durable gains than vertebroplasty in comparative studies; so I should correct my earlier blanket skepticism and frame augmentation as appropriate for selected patients after a short trial of conservative therapy or earlier when pain is refractory and function is severely limited [^1174e1LN] [^117X7jQh]. Let me consider procedure specifics; kyphoplasty offers better height restoration and lower cement leakage risk than vertebroplasty, and early intervention within about 6 weeks may yield superior kyphosis correction, which supports timely referral for patients failing conservative measures [^1143tvES] [^116uuJAK].

> Next, I should review when to escalate. I need to ensure I apply clear triggers: persistent moderate to severe pain despite 2 to 6 weeks of optimized conservative therapy, inability to ambulate or perform basic activities, multiple concurrent fractures, or progressive deformity with unacceptable alignment. These are appropriate indications to discuss augmentation, ideally within the early window for better deformity correction with kyphoplasty, while counseling that long-term outcomes may converge with medical management by 12 months in some cohorts [^1174e1LN] [^115U1g7V] [^116uuJAK] [^116zQgRL]. Hold on, I should verify safety; both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have low serious complication rates when performed by experienced operators, but cement leakage and rare neurologic injury can occur, so shared decision-making should include these risks alongside expected benefits in pain and function [^115A6G8m] [^114fGVG1].

> I should confirm risk stratification and special populations. Older age, female sex, and low bone mineral density are associated with higher risks of new or adjacent-level fractures after augmentation, so I must integrate aggressive osteoporosis therapy and weight-bearing activity as soon as feasible to mitigate subsequent events. I should also double-check that multiple-level augmentation in a single session is acceptable in carefully selected patients with low peri-procedural risk, which NASS notes as a reasonable option in experienced hands [^114m46vV] [^1145xcrc] [^117XQvku]. For very elderly or frail patients, I need to balance procedural risks against the morbidity of prolonged immobility and opioid exposure, which often tilts toward early augmentation to restore mobility and reduce complications, while still optimizing medical comorbidities pre-procedurally [^116pcWyz].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged algorithm. First, confirm the diagnosis and acuity with radiographs and MRI when needed, and screen for malignancy or neurologic compromise. Second, initiate conservative therapy with NSAIDs, activity modification with gradual mobilization, and consideration of a simple soft brace only if it improves comfort, while starting or optimizing osteoporosis therapy. Third, reassess at 2 to 6 weeks and, if pain remains moderate to severe or function remains unacceptable, discuss vertebral augmentation with a preference for kyphoplasty given superior alignment correction and lower leakage risk. Fourth, if augmentation is pursued, aim for early timing within about 6 weeks for better deformity correction. Fifth, continue aggressive osteoporosis management and rehabilitation to restore function and prevent future fractures [^113MTyE2] [^113WRvda] [^1174e1LN] [^116uuJAK] [^112cyVsx].

> I need to ensure osteoporosis disease-modifying therapy is explicit. Bisphosphonates reduce future fracture risk and may be considered in the acute phase, but teriparatide has stronger evidence for improving pain and quality of life at 3 months and may be more cost-effective than combining anti-resorptives with vertebroplasty in some settings. Denosumab is reasonable when bisphosphonates are contraindicated, and I should confirm adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and arrange fall-risk assessment to close the loop on secondary prevention [^111SYx2w] [^111c76E2] [^112cyVsx] [^112kDyea].

> Finally, I should double-check that my recommendations align with guideline scope and disclaimers. NASS emphasizes that guidelines are not rigid protocols and that clinician judgment and patient preferences should guide individualized care, so I will document shared decision-making, especially when considering augmentation, and adjust the plan for comorbidities, goals, and local resources, while maintaining vigilance for evolving evidence and updating practice accordingly [^113n6j2m] [^111RKBbg].

Treatment of lumbar compression fractures centers on **conservative care first** [^112uncyA] (analgesics, brief rest, bracing, and early mobilization) for most patients, with **vertebral augmentation reserved for refractory pain** [^1174e1LN] or progressive deformity [^notfound]. Calcitonin or teriparatide can reduce pain [^11113SeD], and bisphosphonates or denosumab are used for osteoporosis [^112kDyea]. Surgery is rare, indicated for neurologic deficit, severe instability, or failure of conservative care [^notfound]. Early mobilization and osteoporosis therapy are essential to reduce complications and recurrence [^112cyVsx].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **first-line approach** for most lumbar compression fractures, particularly osteoporotic or low-energy trauma cases without neurologic deficits [^111tN7M7].

- **Analgesics**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and short-term opioids for severe pain [^113Setnq].

- **Calcitonin**: Reduces pain in acute osteoporotic fractures; consider for short-term use [^114Rq4A2].

- **Teriparatide**: Anabolic therapy improving pain and function in acute osteoporotic fractures [^111c76E2].

- **Bisphosphonates/denosumab**: Antiresorptives to reduce future fracture risk; start early [^111SYx2w].

- **Bracing**: Short-term use (6–12 weeks) to stabilize spine, reduce pain, and enable mobilization [^113WRvda].

- **Physical therapy**: Early mobilization and core strengthening to restore function and prevent complications [^notfound].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

Minimally invasive procedures, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, are considered for patients with **persistent pain despite conservative management** or for those with significant deformity or multiple fractures [^114EseJ7].

- **Vertebroplasty**: Injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into the vertebral body to stabilize the fracture and reduce pain [^11618Vdw].

- **Kyphoplasty**: Balloon inflation followed by PMMA injection, allowing height restoration and deformity correction [^116nnyLw].

- **Indications**: Refractory pain after 4–6 weeks of conservative therapy, progressive deformity, or multiple fractures [^116pcWyz].

- **Outcomes**: Rapid pain relief, improved function, and reduced deformity; long-term benefits compared to conservative care are debated [^117DBzCg].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is **rarely indicated** and is reserved for specific scenarios:

- **Neurologic deficit**: Spinal cord or nerve root compression requiring decompression [^notfound].

- **Severe instability**: Structural instability or progressive deformity despite conservative care.

- **Failure of conservative therapy**: Persistent pain or functional impairment after prolonged conservative management [^113wAWsT].

Surgical options include **posterior instrumentation and fusion**, decompression with fusion, or **minimally invasive techniques** based on patient-specific factors and surgeon expertise [^116P69oS].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors influence the **selection of treatment**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on treatment choice** |
|-|-|
| Age and comorbidities | Older patients with comorbidities may benefit from minimally invasive procedures due to lower morbidity [^116pcWyz]. |
| Fracture severity and deformity | Severe fractures with significant height loss or kyphosis may require kyphoplasty or surgical intervention [^116zQgRL]. |
| Presence of neurologic deficits | Neurologic involvement necessitates surgical intervention [^notfound]. |
| Patient preferences and functional goals | Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values and lifestyle [^111RKBbg]. |

---

## Potential complications and risks

Each treatment modality carries **specific risks**:

- **Conservative management**: Persistent pain, functional impairment, respiratory complications, and thromboembolic events due to immobilization [^115nUdY9].

- **Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty**: Cement leakage, adjacent vertebral fractures, infection, and neurologic complications [^1126fJeH].

- **Surgical intervention**: Infection, bleeding, neurologic injury, and hardware failure [^115EG7tC].

---

## Post-treatment rehabilitation and follow-up

Post-treatment rehabilitation and follow-up are critical for optimal outcomes. Physical therapy focuses on **restoring mobility, strength, and function** while preventing future fractures [^notfound]. Osteoporosis management with ongoing pharmacologic therapy and lifestyle modifications is essential to maintain bone density and reduce recurrence [^112cyVsx]. Regular follow-up should monitor pain, function, and fracture progression and address complications promptly [^112ErA6d].

---

## Emerging treatments and future directions

Emerging treatments and research directions include **biologic therapies** to enhance bone healing and reduce fracture risk, improved cement materials and delivery systems to minimize complications, and refined patient selection criteria to identify optimal candidates for minimally invasive procedures [^113YAofJ]. Additionally, development of evidence-based clinical guidelines aims to standardize care and improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

Treatment of lumbar compression fractures requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1177Q4w6], with conservative management as the initial strategy and minimally invasive or surgical interventions reserved for specific indications. Early mobilization, pain control, and osteoporosis management are essential to optimize outcomes and prevent recurrence.

### Kyphoplasty for vertebral augmentation in the elderly with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: scenarios and review of recent studies [^116pcWyz]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis are among the most common fractures in the elderly. The treatment focuses on pain control, maintenance of independence, and management of the osteoporosis. Elderly patients often encounter adverse effects to pain medications, do not tolerate bed rest, and are not ideal candidates for invasive spinal reconstructive surgery. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) has become popular as a less-invasive alternative. However, studies have questioned the effectiveness of these procedures.

Methods

The authors conducted a MEDLINE search using relevant search terms including osteoporosis, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, elderly, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty.

Case Summary/Results

Two elderly patients presented with a fracture of their third and first lumbar vertebral body, respectively. One patient progressed well with conservative treatment, whereas the other patient was hospitalized secondary to pain after conservative measures failed to offer improvement. The hospitalized patient subsequently opted for a kyphoplasty and was able to resume his normal daily activities after the procedure.

Conclusions

Selecting patients on an individual case-by-case basis can optimize the effectiveness and outcomes of a vertebral augmentation. This process includes the documentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with the aide of imaging studies, including the acuity of the fracture as well as the correlation with the physical examination findings. Patients who are functional and improving under a conservative regimen are not candidates for kyphoplasty. However, if the conservative management is not successful after 4 to 6 weeks and the patient is at risk to become bedridden, an augmentation should be considered. A kyphoplasty procedure may be preferred over vertebroplasty, given the lower risk profile and better outcomes regarding spinal alignment.

### Can unilateral kyphoplasty replace bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YAofJ]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Kyphoplasty has been proven to be an efficient method to relieve patient suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Because of its technological superiority, unilateral kyphoplasty consumes less operative time and bone cement than traditional bilateral kyphoplasty. However, there is controversy about which method is most efficient in the treatment of OVCFs. Thus, an overall analysis should be performed to shed light on the facts corroborating both procedures.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in treating OVCFs.

Study Design

Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials focusing on comparing unilateral versus bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs. The exclusion criteria contained infection, neoplastic etiology, traumatic fracture, neural compression, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, long-term use of steroids, and kyphoplasty with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment. Retrospective studies, reviews, technology introductions, and biochemical trials were also excluded.

Settings

The PubMed MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematic searched. Only randomized controlled trials published up to June 2015 comparing unilateral kyphoplasty with bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs were identified.

Methods

Two researchers independently screeded the works for inclusion and data extraction. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the methodological quality and evidence synthesis.

Results

Six articles with 563 patients were enrolled in this study. Results showed that the unilateral approach required less surgical time (MD, -23.19; 95% CI, [-27.08, -19.31]; P < 0.00001) and cement consumption (MD, -2.07; 95% CI, [-2.23, -1.91]; P < 0.00001), as well as a reduced cement leakage ratio (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, [0.35, 0.99]; P < 0.05) and improved short-term general health (MD, 1.48; 95% CI, [0.02, 2.93], P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the visual analog scale score (short-term and long-term), Oswestry Disability Index score (mid-term and long-term) kyphotic angle reduction, restoration rate of anterior vertebral height, vertebral height loss rate, postoperative adjacent-level fractures, or in other assessments of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey parameters (short-term and long-term).

Limitations

Only 6 studies were included, so that the sample size was still relatively small and publication bias could not be revealed in this study. Observation time of some data was inconsistent. All of these problems could influence the reliability of the results.

Conclusion

Both unilateral kyphoplasty and bilateral kyphoplasty are safe and effective treatments for OVCFs. However, when operative time, cement volume, cement leakage, short-term general health, radiation dose, and hospitalization costs are taken into consideration, unilateral kyphoplasty may be the better choice. Yet, more high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required to make the final conclusion. Key words: Kyphoplasty, unilateral approach, bilateral approach, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, meta-analysis.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1151FMqu]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

North American Spine Society (NASS) osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures guideline — scope and population — encompasses adults (18 years or older) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture(s) defined as compression fracture of the vertebral body due to decreased cortical or trabecular bone density secondary to osteoporosis, and fractures may or may not be symptomatic and may or may not result in clinically significant deformity and/ or neurologic deficit. The guideline outlines a reasonable evaluation of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and treatment options for adult patients with this condition, is based upon a systematic review of clinical literature available as of September 30, 2020, and does not cover all treatment options for osteoporosis. It states that THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A "STANDARD OF CARE", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol, and emphasizes that treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment and experience.

### Vertebroplasty: weighing the benefits and the risks… [^114EseJ7]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Vertebral injection treatments of fractured or pathologically weakened bone are an important advancement in the management of painful vertebral compression fractures and vertebral metastases. Vertebroplasty introduces a low viscosity cement under relatively high pressure to fill minor voids and the interstices of the cancellous bone. Kyphoplasty involves the creation of a large cavity within the vertebra using an inflatable bone tamp. The creation of this large defect can reduce kyphotic deformity, restore vertebral body height, and allows for the injection of a higher viscosity cement under lower injection pressure. These two procedures are discussed in the article, "Percutaneous Vertebroplasty: New Treatment for Vertebral Compression Fractures, " 1 in this issue of American Family Physician. The indication for vertebral injection therapy must be more selective than just the diagnosis of fracture, metastasis, or hemangioma.

Complications from these procedures can occur and, occasionally, are fatal. Cement intrusion into the spinal canal may require emergent decompression for removal and protection of the neural elements. Patients with severe pain and functional disability from compression fractures who have failed treatment with bracing and analgesia are certainly candidates for vertebral cement injection. Radiographic scans should show acute or subacute fractures. Healed fractures are unlikely to benefit from injection therapy. Without significant wedging or kyphosis, vertebroplasty is appropriate. With multiple fractures and mild kyphosis or single fractures with significant kyphosis, kyphoplasty may provide better long-term results by restoring vertebral height and correcting deformity. For painful metastatic lesions and impending fracture and pain, cement injection can be helpful in improving function and reducing pain. In these circumstances, vertebroplasty is the procedure of choice.

Involvement of the posterior vertebral body wall is a relative contraindication, and injection therapy in these patients should only be performed by physicians who have a large experience with these procedures. Recently, there has been increasing interest in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the management of acute vertebral fractures. However, neither technique has been subjected to controlled trials to demonstrate any benefit over traditional medical management. 2 Long-term studies have not been performed to evaluate possible complications, which could include local acceleration of bone resorption caused by the treatment itself or by foreign-body reaction at the interface of cement and bone, and increased risk of fracture in treated bone or adjacent vertebrae. 3 Until conclusive evidence is available, these procedures should only be performed in carefully selected patients.

### Conservative treatments in the management of acute painful vertebral compression fractures: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112V9LQp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which conservative treatment option is most beneficial regarding pain-related outcomes in acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs)?

Findings

Using data from 20 trials involving 2102 patients, this systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated conservative interventions, including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, teriparatide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and braces, for the treatment of acute VCF. The short-term assessment indicated that calcitonin and NSAIDs were associated with decreased pain during activity, and the long-term assessment revealed that teriparatide was associated with lower pain levels compared with bisphosphonates.

Meaning

These findings and currently established treatment strategies highlight the value of NSAIDs and teriparatide in managing pain in acute VCF, while emphasizing the need for further research.

### Percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture [^114fGVG1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous vertebroplasty remains widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fractures although our 2015 Cochrane review did not support its role in routine practice.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase and trial registries to 15 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, comparing vertebroplasty with placebo (sham), usual care, or another intervention. As it is least prone to bias, vertebroplasty compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Major outcomes were mean overall pain, disability, disease-specific and overall health-related quality of life, patient-reported treatment success, new symptomatic vertebral fractures and number of other serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials were included: five compared vertebroplasty with placebo (541 randomised participants), eight with usual care (1136 randomised participants), seven with kyphoplasty (968 randomised participants) and one compared vertebroplasty with facet joint glucocorticoid injection (217 randomised participants). Trial size varied from 46 to 404 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 62.6 and 81 years, and mean symptom duration varied from a week to more than six months. Three placebo-controlled trials were at low risk of bias and two were possibly susceptible to performance and detection bias. Other trials were at risk of bias for several criteria, most notably due to lack of participant and personnel blinding. Compared with placebo, high- to moderate-quality evidence from five trials (one with incomplete data reported) indicates that vertebroplasty provides no clinically important benefits with respect to pain, disability, disease-specific or overall quality of life or treatment success at one month. Evidence for quality of life and treatment success was downgraded due to possible imprecision. Evidence was not downgraded for potential publication bias as only one placebo-controlled trial remains unreported. Mean pain (on a scale zero to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was five points with placebo and 0.6 points better (0.2 better to 1 better) with vertebroplasty, an absolute pain reduction of 6% (2% better to 10% better, minimal clinical important difference is 15%) and relative reduction of 9% (3% better to14% better) (five trials, 535 participants). Mean disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (scale range zero to 23, higher scores indicate worse disability) was 14.2 points in the placebo group and 1.7 points better (0.3 better to 3.1 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement 7% (1% to 14% better), relative improvement 10% better (3% to 18% better) (three trials, 296 participants). Disease-specific quality of life measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating worse quality of life) was 62 points in the placebo group and 2.75 points (3.53 worse to 9.02 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute change: 3% better (4% worse to 9% better), relative change: 5% better (6% worse to 15% better (two trials, 175 participants). Overall quality of life (European Quality of Life (EQ5D), zero = death to 1 = perfect health, higher scores indicate greater quality of life) was 0.38 points in the placebo group and 0.05 points better (0.01 better to 0.09 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement: 5% (1% to 9% better), relative improvement: 18% (4% to 32% better) (three trials, 285 participants). In one trial (78 participants), 9/40 (or 225 per 1000) people perceived that treatment was successful in the placebo group compared with 12/38 (or 315 per 1000; 95% CI 150 to 664) in the vertebroplasty group, RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.95), absolute difference: 9% more reported success (11% fewer to 29% more); relative change: 40% more reported success (33% fewer to 195% more). Moderate-quality evidence (low number of events) from seven trials (four placebo, three usual care, 1020 participants), up to 24 months follow-up, indicates we are uncertain whether vertebroplasty increases the risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures (70/509 (or 130 per 1000; range 60 to 247) observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 59/511 (120 per 1000) in the control group; RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.87)). Similarly, moderate-quality evidence (low number of events) from five trials (three placebo, two usual care, 821 participants), indicates uncertainty around the risk of other serious adverse events (18/408 or 76 per 1000, range 6 to 156) in the vertebroplasty group compared with 26/413 (or 106 per 1000) in the control group; RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.12). Notably, serious adverse events reported with vertebroplasty included osteomyelitis, cord compression, thecal sac injury and respiratory failure. Our subgroup analyses indicate that the effects did not differ according to duration of pain ≤ 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Including data from the eight trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in a sensitivity analyses altered the primary results, with all combined analyses displaying considerable heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon high- to moderate-quality evidence, our updated review does not support a role for vertebroplasty for treating acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral fractures in routine practice. We found no demonstrable clinically important benefits compared with placebo (sham procedure) and subgroup analyses indicated that the results did not differ according to duration of pain ≤ 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that open trials comparing vertebroplasty with usual care are likely to have overestimated any benefit of vertebroplasty. Correcting for these biases would likely drive any benefits observed with vertebroplasty towards the null, in keeping with findings from the placebo-controlled trials. Numerous serious adverse events have been observed following vertebroplasty. However due to the small number of events, we cannot be certain about whether or not vertebroplasty results in a clinically important increased risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures and/or other serious adverse events. Patients should be informed about both the high- to moderate-quality evidence that shows no important benefit of vertebroplasty and its potential for harm.

Proximal junctional failure (PJF) after surgery for osteoporotic vertebral collapse: PJF was found in 16% within 4 years after surgery; independent risk factors were severe osteoporosis and extended fusion to the sacrum, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) with cut-off value 0.61 g/ cm2 may potentially predict PJF; Level IV evidence also indicates that severe baseline osteoporosis is associated with PJF and that lumbar BMD rather than hip BMD is predictive of PJF.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^113aDEMz]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) — across comparative studies of vertebral procedures and medical therapy — show early advantages for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with convergence by 12 months to 2 years. One paper provides Level III evidence that there was no long-term difference in pain control or function between VA and medical treatment 2 years following treatment. Authors concluded that "percutaneous vertebroplasty should be considered as a valid therapeutic option in symptomatic acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures with refractory pain after a short period of analgesic drug therapy". PVP provided durable and statistically significantly greater improvement in pain and greater reduction in use of analgesics than medical therapy, and immediate pain reduction was superior though final clinical outcomes were similar. Another study concluded that "… PVP is a better choice for the treatment of OVCF compared with PKP or medical management", and VA procedures may offer better pain relief and functional outcomes immediately with loss of effect in the mid-term; PKP improves segmental alignment but is the most expensive treatment. In acute OVCF, authors reported pain relief, physical functioning improvement, and medication requirement after vertebroplasty are immediately and significantly better than medical management, with Level III evidence of improved pain control and function up to 4 weeks postoperative but loss of effect at 1 year and no difference at 12 months. Versus a transdermal fentanyl patch (TFP), the PVP group had a better-preserved compression rate for 1 year but a significantly higher development of adjacent fractures, and TFP side effects occurred in 22.6%, 17 out of 75 patients, with 6 cases due to constipation.

### Traumatic compression fractures in thoracic-lumbar junction: vertebroplasty vs conservative management in a prospective controlled trial [^1125xU8u]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both surgery and conservative management are well established treatments for compression fractures of the thoraco-lumbar spine without neurological compromise. This article aims to compare the outcomes of conservative management to those of vertebroplasty, a relatively safe and simple procedure.

Methods

102 patients were admitted to our neurosurgical unit between January 2012 and February 2016, presenting with a single-level, post-traumatic A1 or A2 Mager l type fracture, affecting the thoracic-lumbar spine without any neurological deficits. After description of both treatment options, the patients were asked to choose between vertebroplasty or conservative treatment. Accordingly, the patients were allocated into two groups and a prospective non-randomized controlled trial was carried out. The first group (Group A) included 52 patients, treated with bed rest and an orthosis. The second group (Group B) of 50 patients underwent a percutaneous vertebroplasty. Pain intensity (assessed via visual analog scale (VAS)), disability degree (assessed via Oswestry Disability Index), ability to resume work (assessed via Denis work Scale), vertebral body height loss rate, regional kyphosis angle (Cobb's angle), duration of hospitalization and treatment-associated complications, were prospectively recorded in a database and analyzed. Follow ups were planned at 1, 6, and 12 months after the injury.

Results

Group B, compared with group A, showed a faster improvement in VAS score as well as functional ability and return to work. Cobb's angle progression was significantly less in the surgical group. Morbidity, mortality, and complication rate were similar and comparable in both groups without a statistical difference (P < 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty is a safe and effective treatment in post-traumatic thoracic-lumbar fractures compared with conservative management.

### Meta-analysis of vertebral augmentation compared with conservative treatment for osteoporotic spinal fractures [^1165QaAs]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Cement augmentation is a controversial treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCF). Our research questions for the meta-analysis were: Is there a clinical and statistical difference in pain relief, functional improvement, and quality of life between conservative care and cement augmentation for VCF and, if so, are they maintained at longer time points? We conducted a search of MEDLINE from January 1980 to July 2011 using PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Searches were performed from medical subject headings. Terms "vertebroplasty" and "compression fracture" were used. The outcome variables of pain, functional measures, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and new fracture risk were analyzed. A random effects model was chosen. Continuous variables were calculated using the standardized mean difference comparing improvement from baseline of the experimental group with the control group. New vertebral fracture risk was calculated using log odds ratio. Six studies met the criteria. The pain visual analog scale (VAS) mean difference was 0.73 (confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.10) for early (< 12 weeks) and 0.58 (CI 0.19, 0.97) for late time points (6 to 12 months), favoring vertebroplasty (p < 0.001). The functional outcomes at early and late time points were statistically significant with 1.08 (CI 0.33, 1.82) and 1.16 (CI 0.14, 2.18), respectively. The HRQOL showed superior results of vertebroplasty compared with conservative care at early and late time points of 0.39 (CI 0.16, 0.62) and 0.33 (CI 0.16, 0.51), respectively. Secondary fractures were not statistically different between the groups, 0.065 (CI -0.57, 0.70). This meta-analysis showed greater pain relief, functional recovery, and health-related quality of life with cement augmentation compared with controls. Cement augmentation results were significant in the early (< 12 weeks) and the late time points (6 to 12 months). This meta-analysis provides strong evidence in favor of cement augmentation in the treatment of symptomatic VCF fractures.

### Vertebral compression fractures in the elderly [^116tXDzV]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Compression fracture of the vertebral body is common, especially in older adults. Vertebral compression fractures usually are caused by osteoporosis, and range from mild to severe. More severe fractures can cause significant pain, leading to inability to perform activities of daily living, and life-threatening decline in the elderly patient who already has decreased reserves. While the diagnosis can be suspected from history and physical examination, plain roentgenography, as well as occasional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, are often helpful in accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Traditional conservative treatment includes bed rest, pain control, and physical therapy. Interventional procedures such as vertebroplasty can be considered in those patients who do not respond to initial treatment. Family physicians can help patients prevent compression fractures by diagnosing and treating predisposing factors, identifying high-risk patients, and educating patients and the public about measures to prevent falls.

### Nonoperative management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1135seBa]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

As the population ages, vertebral compression fractures are an increasing source of pain and dysfunction. The immobilisation that often occurs with fractures can lead to multiple medical complications and their management can be complex as care may require multiple treatment modalities. Each individual responds to pain differently and a treatment plan must be tailored to the individual's pain, functional limitations and goals. The likely first choice for managing stable osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures is conservative management. Treatment options usually involve a combination of medications, bracing and physical therapy. If radicular pain is a component of the pain syndrome, epidural steroid injections may be beneficial. In addition, some patients may benefit from vertebral augmentation. This paper reviews current recommendations for managing vertebral compression fractures. Treatment options including vertebral augmentation are reviewed, including indications and complications.

Natural history evidence — study findings on new or subsequent fractures and risk factors include the following. New fractures were found in 24% of patients for both VP and nonoperative groups with no specific risk factors identified; the refracture rate was approximately 50%, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, and NSAIDs all increased secondary fracture risk, and there were no risk factors in the multivariate analysis; low lumbar BMD, low FIM score, and low segmental Cobb angle demonstrated an increased risk of subsequent fractures; and there is a 19.2% risk of developing new fractures after OVCF.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — medical treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) provides the following directive: Bracing may be considered for adults for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of brace. Grade of Recommendation: C. In a prospective comparative study, the authors concluded that "the 12-week rigid-brace treatment for acute vertebral compression fractures did not result in statistically greater prevention of spinal deformity, better QOL, or lesser back pain than soft-brace treatment at 48 weeks", and therefore "the routine use of a custom-made rigid brace for acute vertebral compression fractures is not justified", with Level II evidence in women showing no significant difference in clinical and radiographic outcomes at 48 weeks between rigid custom-made back support and soft support. In another prospective comparative study, compared to a 3-point orthosis, patients treated with dynamic orthosis had a greater reduction in pain and a greater improvement in quality of life and in respiratory function, with equal effectiveness in stabilizing the fracture, and fewer complications, providing Level II evidence that in patients with acute back pain due to acute OVCF, a dynamic corset produced statistically significant better clinical outcomes than a 3-point brace. In a subacute-stage comparative study of soft lumbar orthosis versus a specific orthosis made of metal with soft padding, the authors concluded that "The effect of the two types of spinal orthoses on the pain level reduction and functional mobility level gain did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) at the subacute stage", and the workgroup downgraded this potential Level II paper due to nonconsecutive and nonmasked patients, nonmasked reviewers, lack of subgroup analysis, and the diagnosis method not being stated, noting Level III evidence that in female patients with acute OVCF there was no difference in clinical outcomes after 3 weeks.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^117X7jQh]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) — across randomized and comparative studies, vertebral augmentation provides immediate symptom benefits versus medical/nonsurgical management but mixed durability. Vertebroplasty provides Level II evidence for immediate but short-term pain relief and improvement in functional outcomes as compared to medical management, and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) provides Level II evidence of rapid durable and significantly greater improvement in pain and function vs medical management. Kyphoplasty-related fracture risk data indicate that BK carries a low risk of adjacent level fractures, and the guideline states kyphoplasty improves pain and function and may decrease the rate of adjacent OVCF development over general followup treatment. In an RCT of acute/subacute fractures, investigators concluded that while PVP helps some patients, the majority of fractures will heal after 8 to 12 weeks of medical management, and the guideline notes PVP may provide immediate but short-lasting pain relief with mid to long term outcomes similar to conservative care. Two BKP RCTs — Wardlaw et al12 (1-year follow-up) and Van Meirhaeghe et al13 (2-year follow-up) — reported a total of 99% osteoporotic etiology and 1% myeloma, found statistically significant improvement in the EQ-5D and less Rolland – Morris disability at 2 years follow-up, and were downgraded to level II for less than 80% followup; overall, BKP was more effective in terms of pain and function than nonsurgical management. In a retrospective cohort, PVP provides a rapid decrease in pain and an early return to daily life activities but may not enhance the quality of life in patients with acute OVF at 6 months follow up, and Level III evidence indicates vertebral augmentation provides improved pain control and function in the first 3 months with no long-term difference in outcomes at 6 months.

Conclusions

Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of various conservative treatments for acute VCF. We identified that calcitonin, in its various forms, and teriparatide stand out for their ability in managing both short-term and long-term pain management associated with these fractures. Given the limitations arising from the included studies' quality and heterogeneity and the lack of sufficient studies, especially on analgesics, our analysis calls for further high-quality RCTs to support clinical decision-making.

Vertebral compression fractures are the most common complication of osteoporosis, with 700,000 cases reported every year in the United States. Vertebral compression fractures typically present with abrupt-onset low back pain with or without a history of trauma, although more than two-thirds are detected incidentally. Diagnosis is confirmed using plain radiographs, while computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be required to evaluate for a malignant cause or if there are neurological deficits on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is also the modality of choice to determine if the fracture is acute vs chronic in nature. Patients can be managed with a combination of nonsurgical modalities including medications, bracing, and physical therapy, although when indicated, kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty may be considered to provide symptom relief.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of vertebral compression fractures: 2022 update [^113MTyE2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) can have a variety of etiologies, including trauma, osteoporosis, or neoplastic infiltration. Osteoporosis related fractures are the most common cause of VCFs and have a high prevalence among all postmenopausal women with increasing incidence in similarly aged men. Trauma is the most common etiology in those > 50 years of age. However, many cancers, such as breast, prostate, thyroid, and lung, have a propensity to metastasize to bone, which can lead to malignant VCFs. Indeed, the spine is third most common site of metastases after lung and liver. In addition, primary tumors of bone and lymphoproliferative diseases such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma can be the cause of malignant VCFs. Although patient clinical history could help raising suspicion for a particular disorder, the characterization of VCFs is usually referred to diagnostic imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Study population selection

This was a retrospective clinical study. A total of 57 patients (23 men, 34 women; age ranged from 64 to 85 years, mean 75.0 years) were identified who had minimally invasive surgery for vsOVCFs in the authors' institution between September 2012 and September 2015, and were divided into two groups: 31 patients received PVP (PVP group) and 26 patients received PKP (PKP group). Table 1 summarizes the detailed characteristics of the two groups of patients which are comparable. Patients older than 60 years of age, bone mineral density T scores < –2.5, and with one level of thoracolumbar vsOVCFs (assessed by MRI, from thoracic 8 to lumbar 2 vertebral bodies) due to osteoporosis were included in this study. vsOVCFs were diagnosed in patients who complained of back pain or lower back pain, had a history of low-energy trauma and tenderness in the thoracolumbar region according to the physical examination, and manifested compression of the vertebral body on plain radiograph (part of the vertebral body collapsed to less than one-third of their original height). All patients enrolled in this study had relatively severe pain despite undergoing conservative management for 2 weeks. However, the patients who met the following criteria were excluded from this study: 1) spinal cord compression or stenosis of the vertebral canal > 30% of the local canal diameter; 2) neurologic deficits; 3) tumor or metastatic tumor that was confirmed by preoperative examination and postoperative pathology; 4) uncorrectable bleeding disorders; 5) systemic or local spine infections; 6) severe comorbidity in the heart, liver, kidney, and lung intolerance to surgery; 7) follow-up < 2 year or lost. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by ethics committee of The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. There is no need to obtain informed consent from patients because this is a retrospective study, and all data were collected and analyzed anonymously.

TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROTIC COMPRESSION FRACTURES

Efficacy and Safety of Balloon Kyphoplasty Compared with Non-Surgical Care for Vertebral Compression Fracture (Free): A Randomized Contolled Trial

What was known?.

Spontaneous vertebral fractures can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The use of both vertebroplasty (augmentation of vertebral compression fractures with polymethylmethacrylate (PMAA)) and kyphoplasty (inflating a balloon to restore the vertebral body to its original height while creating a cavity into which PMMA can be injected under low pressure) is increasing despite little evidence to support their use. There have also been reports of procedures being repeated at previously treated levels and the use of prophylactic vertebroplasty at levels deemed to be at high risk for fracture,

What this study adds.

Kyphoplasty was compared to nonsurgical care in 300 participants in 18 countries in participants with acute vertebral fractures of less than 3 months duration. Nonsurgical care included back brace, walking aids, analgesics and physical therapy. At one month follow-up, kyphoplasty recipients had significant improvement in the SF-36 physical component, 5.2 points (95%CI 2.9–7.4) greater than those who received nonsurgical care. At 12 months, there were no differences in outcomes between groups, and subsequent fractures were common in both groups (33% vs 25% control p = NS).

How should I change my practice?.

In patients with acute fractures, kyphoplasty improves pain and function at 1 month, but after 12 months, there was no difference compared with usual care. Kyphoplasty appears to be safe in the short term. Of note, two recent trials showed no benefit of vertebroplasty compared with placebo, although there was a high rate of crossover in the studies; it is possible that the placebo injected into the periosteum may have had some analgesic effect and the participants had fractures that were less acute (< 12 months in duration). For individuals with compression fractures who have failed conservative treatment, kyphoplasty may be an option to improve symptoms at one month. Longer term data on efficacy are needed.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures — future research and guideline scope: The work group "recommends high-quality studies to identify and optimize the most effective elements of nonoperative/medical management". The work group also "recommends studies to identify the correlation of the patient's perspective in measuring pain improvement (absolute value, degree of change, rate of change, timing, etc.) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)". The guideline clarifies scope and application, stating it "is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less investigation or treatment than what is outlined", that it "should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results", and that "the ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the provider and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution".

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^112Jqenc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Kyphoplasty — Evidence synthesis notes there are three high-quality and 14 moderate-quality studies, but there are no quality studies comparing kyphoplasty with a sham procedure, and two high-quality, sham-controlled trials for vertebroplasty show a lack of benefit. Kyphoplasty has also been found to be associated with subsequent adjacent vertebral compression fractures, and it remains unclear whether highly select patients such as those with three or more simultaneous compression fractures may derive benefit. There is No Recommendation, Low Confidence For or against the use of kyphoplasty for the treatment of low back or thoracic pain due to vertebral compression fractures.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) after vertebroplasty (VP) or percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) — risk factors for new or subsequent vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) include low bone mineral density (BMD), thoracolumbar junction level, older age, and pre-existing fractures. Low T-scores (low BMD) are associated with new VCFs after PV; after VP, osteoporosis and treated level at the thoracolumbar junction were identified as important, and after PVP, advanced age and decreased lumbar and hip BMD scores as well as older age, lower baseline BMD, and more pre-existing vertebral fractures were reported as risk factors.

### Management of the elderly with vertebral compression fractures [^113wAWsT]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common type of fracture secondary to osteoporosis. These fractures are associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality and annual direct medical expenditures of more than $1 billion in the United States. Although many patients will respond favorably to nonsurgical care of their VCF, contemporary natural history data suggest that more than 40% of patients may fail to achieve significant pain relief within 12 months of symptom onset. As a result, percutaneous vertebral augmentation is often used to hasten symptom resolution and return of function. However, controversy regarding the role of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the treatment of symptomatic VCFs exists. The purposes of this review are (1) to outline the epidemiology of VCFs as well as the physical morbidity and economic impact of these injuries, (2) to familiarize the reader with the best available evidence surrounding the operative and nonoperative treatment of VCFs, and (3) to examine the literature pertaining to the cost-effectiveness of surgical management of VCFs with the overarching goal of helping physicians make informed decisions regarding symptomatic VCF treatment.

In addition to pharmacological interventions, we evaluated braces for their association with pain relief for VCF. Here, our network consisted of 4 studies that included rigid, soft, and semirigid active braces and no brace treatment with a mean (SD) latest available follow-up of 22.00 (19.18) weeks (Figure 4 A). Regarding the use of braces for long-term nonspecified pain management, our findings indicated no benefit for semirigid braces (SMD, −1.51; 95% CI, −3.26 to 0.25), soft braces (SMD, −0.54; 95% CI, −2.01 to 0.93), or rigid braces (SMD, −0.26; 95% CI, −1.73 to 1.21) compared with no brace (Figure 4 B and eFigure 8 in Supplement 1). For the use of braces, despite not showing benefits over no brace use, a comparative ranking was performed. Here, the semirigid brace was ranked highest (P-score = 0.96), followed by the soft brace (P-score = 0.51) (eFigure 9 in Supplement 1). However, again, most results were of low or very low certainty of evidence (Table).

### A review of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures [^11765yv3]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures are a common clinical problem and the incidence of them will increase with the ageing population. Traditionally management has been conservative; however, there has been a growing trend towards vertebroplasty as an alternative therapy in patients with persisting severe pain. NICE produced guidance in 2003 recommending the procedure after 4 weeks of conservative management. Recent high-quality studies have been contradictory and there is currently a debate surrounding the role of the procedure with no agreement in the literature. We examine the evidence in both osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures; we also describe the benefits and side effects, alternative treatment options and the cost of the procedure. Finally, we recommend when vertebroplasty is most appropriately used based on the best available evidence.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^1126fJeH]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: retrospective studies of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) identify risk factors and procedural considerations for subsequent fractures and recollapse. Bone cement injection volume, bone mineral density (BMD), and sex were related to adjacent fractures after vertebroplasty, with cement injection volumes exceeding 40.5% causing adjacent vertebral fractures, and in PKP patients, severe osteoporosis and bone cement leakage were risk factors for new fractures. After PVP for single-level OVCF, low BMD, high preoperative compression ratio, and high preoperative SI may be predictive factors for SNVCFs, and the injected bone cement "should be distributed both evenly and symmetrically along the inferior-to-superior axis" and the relative volume "should not be excessive"; bone cement "should be injected carefully to avoid upper adjacent intracanal leakage", and "Prompt BMD correction is important to prevent SNVCF". Additional data indicate that low BMD, treatment by PKP or vertebroplasty, and low cement volume potentially risk a re-collapse of the treated vertebra, that high bone resorption markers with normal bone formation markers may be associated with increased risk of new recurrent fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty, and that a substantial number of patients develop new fractures after vertebroplasty with two-thirds adjacent to previously treated levels; outcome influences include body mass index (BMI), history of fractures, metabolic diseases/medications, BMD of lumbar spine and hip, anti-osteoporosis therapy, and use of a back brace, and patients with new fractures differ by lower BMI, lower BMD, and lower serum PTH levels.

Kyphoplasty adjuncts and medical therapy — preventive strategies against new vertebral compression fractures include procedural cement use and osteoporosis management. For kyphoplasty, investigators concluded that "the application of a small amount of PMMA can be considered in order to lower the risk of new fractures in adjacent vertebrae. The postoperative use of anti-osteoporotic medication is recommended for the prevention of new VCFs". Additionally, authors emphasized systemic management: "The most important elements related to reducing NVCF were treating osteoporosis and improving BMD and BMI. More aggressive BMD and BMI correction is more important than the vertebroplasty technique".

### Percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture [^116XfwnA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous vertebroplasty is widely used to treat acute and subacute painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures although recent placebo-controlled trials have questioned its value.

Objectives

To synthesise the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 2014. We also reviewed reference lists of review articles, trials and trial registries to identify any other potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures of any duration and comparing vertebroplasty with placebo (sham), usual care, or any other intervention. As it is least prone to bias, vertebroplasty compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Major outcomes were mean overall pain, disability, disease-specific and overall health-related quality of life, patient-reported treatment success, new symptomatic vertebral fractures and number of other serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed 'Risk of bias' assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using GRADE.

Main Results

Eleven RCTs and one quasi-RCT conducted in various countries were included. Two trials compared vertebroplasty with placebo (209 randomised participants), six compared vertebroplasty with usual care (566 randomised participants) and four compared vertebroplasty with kyphoplasty (545 randomised participants). Trial size varied from 34 to 404 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 63.3 and 80 years, and mean symptom duration varied from a week to more than six months. Both placebo-controlled trials were judged to be at low overall risk of bias while other included trials were generally considered to be at high risk of bias across a range of criteria, most seriously due to lack of participant and study personnel blinding. Compared with placebo, there was moderate quality evidence based upon two trials that vertebroplasty provides no demonstrable benefits with respect to pain, disability, disease-specific or overall quality of life or treatment success. At one month, mean pain (on a scale 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 5 points with placebo and 0.7 points better (1.5 better to 0.15 worse) with vertebroplasty, an absolute pain reduction of 7% (15% better to 1.5% worse) and relative reduction of 10% (21% better to 2% worse) (two trials, 201 participants). At one month, mean disability measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (scale range 0 to 23, higher scores indicate worse disability) was 13.6 points in the placebo group and 1.1 points better (2.9 better to 0.8 worse) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in disability 4.8% (12.8% better to 3.3% worse), relative change 6.3% better (17.0% better to 4.4% worse) (two trials, 201 participants). At one month, disease-specific quality of life measured by the QUALEFFO (scale 0 to 100, higher scores indicating worse quality of life) was 2.4 points in the placebo group and 0.40 points worse (4.58 better to 5.38 worse) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute change: 0.4% worse (5% worse to 5% better), relative change 0.7% worse (9% worse to 8% better (based upon one trial, 73 participants). At one month overall quality of life measured by the EQ5D (0 = death to 1 = perfect health, higher scores indicate greater quality of life at one month was 0.27 points in the placebo group and 0.05 points better (0.01 worse to 0.11 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in quality of life 5% (1% worse to 11% better), relative change 18% better (4% worse to 39% better) (two trials, 201 participants). Based upon one trial (78 participants) at one month, 9/40 (or 225 per 1000) people perceived that treatment was successful in the placebo group compared with 12/38 (or 315 per 1000; range 150 to 664) in the vertebroplasty group, RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.95), absolute risk difference 9% more reported success (11% fewer to 29% more); relative change 40% more reported success (33% fewer to 195% more). Based upon moderate quality evidence from three trials (one placebo, two usual care, 281 participants) with up to 12 months follow-up, we are uncertain whether or not vertebroplasty increases the risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures (28/143 observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 19/138 in the control group; RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.39 to 5.50). Similary, based upon moderate quality evidence from two placebo-controlled trials (209 participants), we are uncertain about the exact risk of other adverse events (3/106 were observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 3/103 in the placebo group; RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.21 to 4.85)). Notably, serious adverse events reported with vertebroplasty included osteomyelitis, cord compression, thecal sac injury and respiratory failure. Our subgroup analyses provided limited evidence that the effects did not differ according to duration of pain ≤ 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Including data from the six trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in a sensitivity analyses inconsistently altered the primary results, with all combined analyses displaying substantial to considerable heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon moderate quality evidence, our review does not support a role for vertebroplasty for treating osteoporotic vertebral fractures in routine practice. We found no demonstrable clinically important benefits compared with a sham procedure and subgroup analyses indicated that results did not differ according to duration of pain ≤ 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that open trials comparing vertebroplasty with usual care are likely to have overestimated any benefit of vertebroplasty. Correcting for these biases would likely drive any benefits observed with vertebroplasty towards the null, in keeping with findings from the placebo-controlled trials. Numerous serious adverse events have been observed following vertebroplasty. However due to the small number of events, we cannot be certain about whether or not vertebroplasty results in a clinically important increased risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures and/or other serious adverse events. Patients should be informed about both the lack of high quality evidence supporting benefit of vertebroplasty and its potential for harm.

A randomized, controlled trial of 125 patients with vertebral fractures noted a significantly increased incidence of additional vertebral fractures with vertebroplasty at 12 months' follow-up, whereas another study found no difference in new fractures versus usual care at a mean of 11.4 months with decreased severity of further height loss in treated vertebrae. In balloon kyphoplasty, new vertebral fractures were detected in 20.7% of treated patients with more than half adjacent to the treated level. Given the limitations to these published studies, the role for surgical procedures in treatment of vertebral fractures remains uncertain.

### Effectiveness of vertebroplasty using individual patient data from two randomised placebo controlled trials: meta-analysis [^113WQkxz]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Two recent randomised placebo controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, the only published randomised trials with a placebo control, blinded treatment allocation, and blinded outcome assessment, failed to confirm the efficacy of vertebroplasty. These results have generated considerable controversy. Despite the negative overall findings of the two placebo controlled trials, it has been suggested that there may be subgroups of patients who would benefit from vertebroplasty, and the suitability of the procedure for some of the included trial participants has been questioned. Some commentators have maintained that vertebroplasty should only be offered to patients with acute vertebral fractures of recent onset (< 6 weeks), whereas others have claimed it is more effective for those with severe pain.

Since publication of these trials, the results from the vertebroplasty versus conservative treatment in acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (Vertos II) trial, a large open label randomised trial, have also been reported. The participants' mean duration of pain was slightly less than six weeks and all reported baseline scores for pain of 5 or more on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale. Compared with usual care, vertebroplasty resulted in an additional benefit of 2.6 units on the pain scale at one month, a result that was clinically and statistically significant. However, these results may be explained by the fact that neither the participants nor the outcome assessors or investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. Empirical evidence from meta-epidemiological studies has shown that lack of blinding results in an average 25% over-estimate of relative treatment benefit.

Acutely painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures generally heal quickly, as was well illustrated in the Vertos II trial in which more than 50% of those who initially qualified for the study were deemed ineligible owing to spontaneous resolution of pain. This implies that most people would be unlikely to benefit from early invasive intervention, and it would need to be postulated that a subgroup with more persistent symptoms would derive benefit.

In contrast with what has been claimed both placebo controlled trials included participants with recent onset fractures (< 6 weeks) — one third in the Australian study and about 20% in the US trial. Although neither trial found evidence that duration of symptoms was a treatment effect modifier, individually they lacked sufficient power to draw definitive conclusions from subgroup analyses. They also lacked sufficient power to investigate smaller benefits in pain or function than those originally hypothesised. By combining the data from both trials, the larger overall sample size provides an opportunity to undertake select subgroup analyses and to investigate smaller benefits in pain or function.

### Abstract… [^11618Vdw]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Traditional treatment of painful compression fractures has included bed rest, oral or parenteral analgesics, muscle relaxants, external back-bracing, and physical therapy. 2 Calcitonin also appears to have a variable analgesic effect in osteoporotic compression fractures. 3 The majority of patients respond favorably to traditional treatment; however, there are some patients who fail with conservative therapy and suffer from prolonged pain and immobility, which can persist for life. 4 Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a newer technique in which acrylic cement is injected through a needle into a collapsed or weakened vertebra to stabilize the fracture. This procedure is effective for treating certain types of painful vertebral compression fractures and some painful or unstable benign and malignant vertebral lesions that fail to respond to the traditional conservative therapies.

Most experts believe that pain relief is achieved through mechanical support and stability provided by the bone cement. The semisolid mixture of polymethylmethacrylate, an acrylic cement used in orthopedic procedures, has been shown to restore strength and stiffness in vertebral bodies in postmortem studies. Outcome Studies Although no controlled studies comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty with conservative therapy for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures have been performed, multiple case studies and series have demonstrated positive outcomes. One study. A series 14 of 289 vertebrae in 105 patients who were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty for a variety of lesions showed favorable outcomes in 78 percent of patients with osteoporotic lesions, 83 percent of patients with malignant lesions, and 73 percent of patients with vertebral hemangiomas.

Results of a study 10 on percutaneous vertebroplasty in 231 patients showed a 90 percent success rate in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and an 80 percent success rate in painful or unstable neoplastic lesions and vertebral hemangiomas. Another study 15 reported good pain relief in 73 percent of patients with at least a 50 percent reduction in analgesic dose; this study also reported moderate pain relief in 29 percent of patients with painful malignant vertebral lesions. A local tumoricidal effect within and around the cement mass has been demonstrated in a postmortem study 16 of six patients who had been treated by vertebroplasty for malignant vertebral lesions.

### Nonoperative treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures: a prospective randomized study of different treatment options [^111euzAv]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate and compare nonoperative treatment methods for traumatic thoracic and lumbar compression fractures and burst fractures.

Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial with long-term follow-up.

Setting

Two general hospitals in the Netherlands.

Patients/Participants

Patients with a traumatic thoracic or lumbar spine fracture, without neurologic damage, with less than 50% loss of height of the anterior column and less than 30% reduction of the spinal canal were included.

Intervention

Patients in the compression group were randomized to physical therapy and postural instructions, a brace for 6 weeks, or a Plaster of Paris cast for 6 or 12 weeks. Patients in the burst group received a brace or a Plaster of Paris cast, both for 12 weeks.

Main Outcome Measurements

Follow-up examinations included radiographs, Visual Analogue Scores for toleration of treatment and persistent pain, and an Oswestry Disability Index at long-term follow-up.

Results

There were 133 patients: 108 in the compression group and 25 in the burst group. For compression fractures, physical therapy and brace were considered the most tolerable. Brace therapy scored significantly better on the Visual Analogue Scores for residual pain and on the Oswestry Disability Index. None of the treatments had any significant effect on the residual deformity measurements. For burst fractures, no significant differences were found.

Conclusions

Brace treatment with supplementary physical therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Furthermore, more than 20% of all patients had moderate or severe back pain at long-term follow-up.

### The treatment of symptomatic osteoporotic spinal compression fractures [^114Rq4A2]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is based on a series of systematic reviews of published studies on the treatment of symptomatic osteoporotic spinal compression fractures. Of 11 recommendations, one is strong; one, moderate; three, weak; and six, inconclusive. The strong recommendation is against the use of vertebroplasty to treat the fractures; the moderate recommendation is for the use of calcitonin for 4 weeks following the onset of fracture. The weak recommendations address the use of ibandronate and strontium ranelate to prevent additional symptomatic fractures, the use of L2 nerve root blocks to treat the pain associated with L3 or L4 fractures, and the use of kyphoplasty to treat symptomatic fractures in patients who are neurologically intact.

### Does percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures increase the incidence of new vertebral fractures? A meta-analysis [^11614uiC]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Because of an aging population, osteoporotic vertebral fractures are becoming more frequent. Conservative therapy was considered the gold standard for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) in the past. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) as minimally invasive techniques are new treatments that are widely used for painful OVCFs. However, an increase in new vertebral compression fractures at non-treated levels following augmentation is of concern. There is no convincing evidence that new fractures are inevitable after augmentation compared to after conservative treatment, and it is still unclear whether further fractures are the consequence of augmentation or a result of the natural progression of osteoporosis.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the new-level fracture risk after PVP or BKP compared with conservative (non-operative) treatment and to determine the dominant risk factor associated with new OVCFs.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of comparative studies was performed to evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures between vertebral augmentation, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, and no operation.

Setting

The PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ELSEVIER ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in annual proceedings were systematically searched. In addition, we also retrieved data from references when titles met our inclusion criteria.

Methods

Detailed searches of a number of online databases comparing operative and non-operative groups were performed. We included randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, and prospective clinical studies to provide available data. All studies were reviewed by two reviewers independently, and all the references that met our inclusion criteria were searched for additional trials, using the guidelines set by the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis) statement.

Results

We evaluated 12 studies encompassing 1,328 patients in total, including 768 who underwent operation with polymethylmethacrylateand 560 who received non-operative treatments. For new-level vertebral fractures, our meta-analysis found no significant difference between the 2 methods, including total new fractures (P = 0.55) and adjacent fractures (P = 0.5). For pre-existing vertebral fractures, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (operative and non-operative groups) (P = 0.24). Additionally, there was no significant difference in bone mineral density, both in the lumbar (P = 0.13) and femoral neck regions (P = 0.37), between the 2 interventions.

Limitation

All studies we screened were published online except for unpublished articles. Moreover, only a few data sources could be extracted from the published studies. There were only 5 randomized clinical trials and 7 prospective studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusion

Vertebral augmentation techniques, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fractures in order to alleviate back pain and correct the deformity, and it has been frequently reported that many new vertebral fractures occurred after this operation. Our analysis did not reveal evidence of an increased risk of fracture of vertebral bodies, especially those adjacent to the treated vertebrae, following augmentation with either method compared with conservative treatment. Key words: Vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, new osteoporotic compression vertebral fracture, meta-analysis.

Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been used to treat osteoporotic compression fractures for many years. In 2009, two randomized controlled trials demonstrated limited effectiveness of vertebroplasty over sham treatment; thus, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons published evidence-based guidelines recommending "against vertebroplasty for patients who present with an osteoporotic spinal compression fracture". However, several other trials have since been published that contradict these conclusions. A recent meta-analysis cited strong evidence in favor of cement augmentation in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral compression fractures.

Introduction

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common type of osteoporotic fractures and occur primarily in women and men older than 50 years. Although it has been reported that 2 of 3 VCFs remain asymptomatic, those fractures that do present with symptoms often lead to substantial pain, reduced mobility, and quality of life. Therefore, effective pain management is crucial for restoring functionality and patient outcomes. Regardless of their impact, an optimal and universally accepted reference standard treatment to address pain has not yet been established. Initially, percutaneous surgical techniques gained popularity owing to the promise of effective pain reduction. However, various studies, showed conflicting results concerning the efficacy of these techniques. Because both commonly performed surgical cement augmentation procedures, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have failed to demonstrate consistent benefits in terms of pain relief in previous studies, optimized conservative pain management should be applied first for treating affected patients.

For this reason, the utility of conservative therapies to treat acute painful VCF has been explored in the past. These include braces, analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids, but also various antiosteoporotic drugs, including antiresorptives (eg, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and denosumab) or osteoanabolic agents (eg, teriparatide). However, the impact of the studies published to date is limited by a lack of comparative analyses, conflicting results, and low statistical power. Given these challenges, there is a critical need for a systematic review and network meta-analysis to thoroughly assess conservative treatment options and provide clinicians with clear, evidence-based guidelines for managing VCF.

Therefore, this systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to assess and compare different conservative treatment options in managing acute pain related to VCF. On the basis of the findings, we provide evidence to guide clinical decision-making and optimize pain management strategies for patients with acute painful VCF.

Interventional treatment question 5 — operative timing for kyphoplasty in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: Kyphoplasty is effective for vertebral height restoration as well as pain relief for both acute, subacute and chronic fractures, but the achievable correction of the fracture-related local kyphosis decreases significantly after 6 weeks. Level III evidence indicates that optimal correction of fracture-related local kyphosis improves if kyphoplasty is performed within 6-weeks after fracture onset.

Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) result from either trauma or a pathologic process that weakens the bone by conditions such as osteoporosis or tumor. The incidence of VCFs has been rising over the last few decades in accordance with the aging population. These fractures can result in severe pain, physical limitation and disability, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with VCFs are optimally treated by accurate and early diagnosis and treatment. An effective method to treat these fractures is percutaneous vertebral augmentation, which is a set of minimally invasive procedures that stabilizes osseous fractures, provides immediate pain relief, and improves quality of life. Vertebral augmentation procedures include vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and vertebral augmentation with implants. Each of these techniques is described in general terms in this article. The ideal candidate for vertebral augmentation is a patient with a symptomatic fracture seen on cross-sectional imaging in which nonsurgical management has failed and has positive signs on physical examination with no absolute contraindication. This procedure should be done with the appropriate equipment and personnel in a facility designed for this purpose. After the procedure, the patient should undergo the appropriate follow-up to ensure optimal recovery. Additionally, it is essential that the patient receives appropriate therapy for the underlying disorder that predisposed them to the vertebral fracture.

### What is the role of vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic fractures? A review of the recent literature [^115A6G8m]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vertebral augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are utilized in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). However, their capacity for providing analgesia, reducing disability, and improving quality of life in patients with osteoporotic VCFs remains a topic of debate. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the latest evidence for the safety and efficacy of vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases for systematic reviews, review articles, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials prior to May 2017. The keywords were "vertebroplasty", "kyphoplasty", and "vertebral augmentation".

Results

Thirty-three papers (7 systematic reviews, 6 cohort studies, 15 randomized clinical trials, and 5 international guidelines) were included in this narrative review.

Conclusion

Vertebral augmentation is a safe procedure, with low rates of serious complications and no increase in subsequent post-treatment fracture risk.

### Conservative treatments in the management of acute painful vertebral compression fractures: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111SZhhL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Network Meta-Analysis recommendations. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. Informed consent and institutional review board approval were not required because the study does not constitute human participants research, in accordance with 45 CFR §46. The last search was performed on May 16, 2023, in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. In addition, we also conducted a gray literature search within Scopus and Embase. We further manually reviewed the reference lists of published systematic reviews and included studies. The search strategy was designed according to the Participants, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) model (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1).

Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed in accordance with the PICO model: Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or prospective comparative studies (PCSs) that examined patients with acute painful VCF. In these studies, conservative treatment modalities, such as analgesics, antiosteoporotic drugs, other pharmacological interventions, or braces, had to be investigated and compared against no treatment, placebo, or other conservative treatments. To be considered for inclusion, studies were required to assess outcomes related to pain. Furthermore, studies had to be published after January 1996 to align with current medical standards and treatments, particularly with regard to osteoporosis medication. We did not apply further limits regarding the age of patients or the language of publication. Details on data collection and abstraction are presented in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.

Assessment of Study Quality

Each included study was independently assessed for risk of bias by 2 authors (A.R. A. and T.R.). For RCTs, the assessment was conducted using the second version of the Cochrane tool to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB2). For PCSs, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used. In addition, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, tailored for network meta-analysis, was used to appraise the overall certainty of the evidence regarding each outcome (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Further details on the assessment of study quality are presented in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.

### Comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty and conservative therapy for treating osteoporotic compression fractures in the thoracic and lumbar spine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11572iCh]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral compression fractures are a common complication of osteoporosis and are often treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). The ability of this procedure to relieve pain better than conservative treatment is still debated. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree and duration of pain relief following PVP with that following conservative treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures by means of meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Methods

The CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science databases were queried for randomized controlled trials comparing PVP with conservative treatment or placebo/sham. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework. Random-effects meta-analysis of the raw mean difference between groups in change in pain level was performed, with sensitivity analyses and the Egger test for potential publication bias.

Results

Of 209 records found, 11 were considered relevant, involving 1,048 participants. The risk of bias was considered low in 10 studies and high in 1. The 531 patients treated with PVP had a significantly lower pain level compared with the control group at 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 3 months, and 12 months. The 95% CI (confidence interval) of the pooled effect size at every time interval included the score of 1.5, considered to be the minimal clinically important difference. The largest pooled effect size of -1.4 (95% CI, -2.3 to -0.5) was found during the first 1 to 2 weeks. The heterogeneity was high at all 3 time points (I(2), 71% to 96%). No significant publication bias was detected.

Conclusions

Up to 1 year postoperatively, the effect of PVP exceeded the effect of conservative therapy with respect to pain relief in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures. The effect size was significant and close to the minimal clinically important difference.

### Conservative treatments in the management of acute painful vertebral compression fractures: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113Setnq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) frequently cause substantial pain and reduced mobility, posing a major health problem. Despite the critical need for effective pain management to restore functionality and improve patient outcomes, the value of various conservative treatments for acute VCF has not been systematically investigated.

Objective

To assess and compare different conservative treatment options in managing acute pain related to VCF.

Data Sources

On May 16, 2023, 4 databases-PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL-were searched. In addition, a gray literature search within Scopus and Embase was also conducted.

Study Selection

Included studies were prospective comparative and randomized clinical trials that assessed conservative treatments for acute VCF.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction and synthesis were performed by 2 authors according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Network Meta-Analyses recommendations. A frequentist graph-theoretical model and a random-effects model were applied for the meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were short-term (4 weeks) pain during activity and long-term (latest available follow-up) nonspecified pain in patients with acute VCF.

Results

The study included 20 trials, encompassing 2102 patients, and evaluated various interventions for managing VCF. Calcitonin (standardized mean difference [SMD], -4.86; 95% CI, -6.87 to -2.86) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; SMD, -3.94; 95% CI, -7.30 to -0.58) were beneficial regarding short-term pain during activity compared with placebo. For long-term nonspecific pain management, bisphosphonates were associated with inferior pain outcomes compared with daily (SMD, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.31) or weekly (SMD, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 2.21) administration of teriparatide, with no treatment being superior to NSAIDs. The qualitative analysis of adverse events highlighted that typical adverse events associated with these medications were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

NSAIDs and teriparatide may be the preferred treatment options for pain management in acute osteoporotic VCF. Although calcitonin also proved to be beneficial, its safety profile and potential adverse effects restrict its widespread application. The limited evidence on braces and analgesics underscores the urgent need for future research.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^111jUpmJ]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: There is conflicting evidence to make a recommendation for or against vertebral augmentation compared to medical treatment regarding new, adjacent-level, or distant fractures (Grade of Recommendation: I). A prospective comparative study concluded that balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) carries a low risk of adjacent level fractures and had a positive effect over conventional treatment on reducing the incidence of adjacent level fracture, with Level II evidence that VA with KP improves pain and function and may decrease adjacent osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture development one year following treatment. Another prospective comparative study concluded that PVP/PKP was not associated with increased risk of recompression in new levels, although recompression in new levels occurred sooner and adjacent-level new vertebral fractures were substantially higher in the PVP/PKP group. A retrospective comparative study found that patients treated with nonoperative medical management had a 2.8 times greater risk for a subsequent vertebral compression fracture than those treated with balloon kyphoplasty and PMMA augmentation, providing Level III evidence that BKP had fewer vertebral compression fractures than medical management.
