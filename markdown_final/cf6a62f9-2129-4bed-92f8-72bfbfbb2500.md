## Question

Questions to ask for HPI acute appendicitis and physical exam

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the key HPI questions and a step-by-step physical examination for suspected acute appendicitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core history elements, including onset, location, and migration of pain. Then, I should verify critical associated gastrointestinal symptoms and their diagnostic value. Next, I will examine systemic features and pertinent negatives, followed by a methodical abdominal examination and classic maneuvers. After that, I need to integrate clinical risk scores and consider special populations such as children, pregnant patients, and older adults. Finally, I should confirm documentation priorities, initial tests, risk-based imaging, and next steps in management while checking guideline alignment and potential pitfalls [^113sunE7] [^112kVqGy].

> Let me first confirm the chief complaint and pain chronology because the timing and migration pattern are foundational to pretest probability; classically, pain starts vaguely in the periumbilical area and migrates to the right lower quadrant over 12–24 hours, which remains one of the most informative historical features, though I should remember that atypical anatomy and age can obscure this pattern, so I must not over-rely on it without corroboration [^113sunE7] [^111mMYUn] [^116xsjyA].

> Wait, let me verify the qualitative pain features that strengthen suspicion: pain that worsens with movement, coughing, or bumps in the road suggests peritoneal irritation and raises likelihood, but I should double-check that these are supportive rather than pathognomonic; in practice, they sharpen my gestalt without replacing a systematic evaluation [^111qaWD9] [^1169JEG2].

> I will now examine associated gastrointestinal symptoms, but hold on — I should verify the directionality of key symptoms; nausea and vomiting commonly occur, yet "pain before vomiting" carries particular rule-out value in patients with both pain and emesis, so I should explicitly ask this and, if present, document it to refine risk while acknowledging its low specificity [^113sunE7] [^113FoVyH].

> Next, I should review anorexia, obstipation or diarrhea, and abdominal distention; these are supportive features rather than decisive criteria, so I need to weigh them alongside the pain narrative to avoid premature closure and maintain diagnostic breadth early in the encounter [^111mMYUn] [^113sunE7].

> I need to check for systemic features now: low-grade fever is common, malaise is nonspecific, and importantly, recent upper respiratory symptoms have been identified as a negative predictor in pediatric cohorts — so if present, I should be more cautious about over-calling appendicitis and ensure I document these potentially competing clues [^113sunE7] [^111mMYUn] [^111qaWD9].

> But wait, what if the patient is of reproductive potential; I should confirm last menstrual period and pregnancy status early because it reframes the differential, influences imaging choices, and guards against anchoring bias when presentations are atypical in pregnancy due to displacement of the appendix [^116xsjyA] [^115yTKzt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also elicit pertinent negatives that pivot the differential: urinary symptoms or hematuria that could suggest urinary tract pathology, chest pain or dyspnea for thoracic causes, and a history of similar pain that might indicate chronic or recurrent conditions, keeping in mind that labs alone are not sufficiently specific to clinch appendicitis without clinical context [^112p7nKs] [^116xsjyA].

> Let me think about the general assessment and vitals before the focused exam; fever contributes to clinical scores, and I should ensure adequate analgesia because evidence does not support withholding pain control due to diagnostic concerns — undertreatment only harms the patient and does not improve accuracy [^115Kx1L8] [^113MDZpS].

> I will now examine the abdomen systematically: inspection for distention, auscultation for bowel sounds with the caveat that decreased sounds are more useful in complicated cases and in children, gentle percussion to localize tenderness, and graded palpation starting away from the pain with attention to right lower quadrant focal tenderness, involuntary guarding, and rebound, which collectively heighten concern for peritoneal irritation and appendiceal inflammation [^113sunE7] [^111NC37S] [^111mMYUn].

> I should confirm specific maneuvers next; Rovsing's sign, the psoas sign (especially for retrocecal appendices), and the obturator sign (suggesting a pelvic appendix) can refine localization, but I need to remember their limited standalone sensitivity and integrate them with the overall clinical picture; if heel-drop (Markle) testing is considered, I must contextualize it as a lower-credibility adjunct rather than a decisive test [^111mMYUn] [^111NC37S] [^1169JEG2].

> Now, let me reconsider how to integrate scoring systems without overstepping their intended use; I initially thought an Alvarado score of 7 or more might "rule in" appendicitis, but hold on, I should verify this against higher-quality guidance — evidence supports using Alvarado primarily to stratify risk and help rule out at low cutoffs, while WSES explicitly recommends against using Alvarado to confirm appendicitis in adults, so I should use Alvarado, AIR, or PAS to guide imaging and disposition rather than to make a definitive diagnosis [^113ETXhL] [^117G1C28] [^113UpN95] [^111u63nW].

> Let me first confirm pediatric considerations: in children, validated tools like the Pediatric Appendicitis Score help triage risk; fever is often the single most useful sign, yet clinical variability is greater, so I should rely more on ultrasound first when imaging is needed and document serial exams if observation is chosen to minimize radiation and catch evolution of signs [^1147W3bL] [^115VuY6i] [^1179vQCb].

> For pregnant patients, I need to ensure that I do not rely on symptoms and signs alone for diagnosis; ultrasound is first-line, and if nondiagnostic, MRI is preferred to avoid ionizing radiation, so I should align my imaging choices with these constraints and maintain a lower threshold for advanced imaging when the clinical picture is equivocal [^115yTKzt] [^115u6NQL].

> In older adults, presentations are frequently atypical and the risk of perforation is higher, so I should confirm early imaging and early surgical consultation thresholds while recognizing that laparoscopy remains the procedure of choice when surgery is indicated in this group [^113StoGK] [^111KH3za].

> Next, I should review documentation and initial tests with a probabilistic plan: thoroughly record positive and negative findings, obtain CBC and urinalysis to assist in triage without overinterpreting normal results, and proceed with imaging based on risk — ultrasound first where sonographic expertise exists or is preferred, CT favored for nonpregnant adults when imaging is indicated, and MRI for pregnancy or equivocal ultrasound; high-risk patients warrant prompt surgical consultation, while low-risk patients may be observed with serial exams and safety-net instructions [^113sunE7] [^113ETXhL] [^1179vQCb] [^113EpF3D].

> I should double-check microbiology guidance before ordering blood cultures; per IDSA, blood cultures are reserved for patients with systemic instability or specific risk factors for resistant organisms, so I must avoid routine cultures in stable, uncomplicated presentations and target them to the cohort in whom results will change management [^113maybt].

> Finally, let me verify alignment with contemporary pathways: a tailored approach that starts with a careful HPI and focused exam, integrates validated scores to stratify risk rather than to confirm diagnosis, and uses risk-appropriate imaging while considering patient-specific factors is the most reliable way to reduce misses and unnecessary radiation or operations, and I should re-examine the patient if initial findings are equivocal to detect evolution over time before committing to definitive decisions [^113sunE7] [^112kVqGy].

For suspected acute appendicitis, the HPI should focus on **pain migration** [^113sunE7] and **pain before vomiting** [^113FoVyH] to support the diagnosis, while the physical exam should prioritize **RLQ tenderness** and **rebound/guarding** [^111NC37S] to detect peritonitis. These elements, combined with clinical scores and imaging, guide timely management and reduce diagnostic error [^112pwbas] [^111KH3za].

---

## Key HPI questions for acute appendicitis

### Pain characteristics

Assess **pain onset and duration** (start time and persistence), initial location, and any **migration** — classically from periumbilical to the RLQ [^113sunE7] [^116xsjyA]. Characterize quality (sharp, dull, cramping), severity, and aggravating or relieving factors such as movement, coughing, or eating [^1149qknL].

---

### Associated symptoms

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Presence, onset, and relation to pain (pain before vomiting supports appendicitis) [^113FoVyH]
- **Anorexia**: Loss of appetite [^113sunE7]
- **Fever and chills**: Presence and duration [^113sunE7] [^115VuY6i]
- **Bowel habits**: Diarrhea, constipation, or obstipation [^111NC37S]
- **Urinary symptoms**: Dysuria, frequency, hematuria [^113sunE7]

---

### Past medical and surgical history

Review **previous abdominal surgeries**, including prior appendectomy or other abdominal procedures [^115w1iGU]. Elicit **chronic illnesses** such as diabetes, immunosuppression, or inflammatory bowel disease, and review current medications and allergies, noting recent antibiotics or analgesics [^113sunE7].

---

### Social and demographic factors

Consider **age and sex**, as pediatric, elderly, or pregnant patients may have atypical presentations [^113sunE7], and **recent travel or dietary changes**, which may indicate exposure to infectious agents or dietary triggers [^112p7nKs].

---

## Key physical examination findings

### General appearance and vital signs

Note the patient's **general appearance** — ill-appearing, distressed, or toxic [^116zKZYC] — and **vital signs** (fever, tachycardia, hypotension), which may suggest perforation or sepsis [^113sunE7] [^113maybt].

---

### Abdominal examination

- **Inspection**: Distension, visible peristalsis, surgical scars [^116zKZYC]
- **Auscultation**: Decreased or absent bowel sounds [^1149qknL]
- **Palpation**: RLQ tenderness at McBurney's point, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity [^113sunE7]
- **Percussion**: Tenderness, especially in the RLQ [^116zKZYC]

---

### Specific appendicitis signs

- **Rovsing's sign**: RLQ pain with LLQ palpation [^111NC37S]
- **Psoas sign**: RLQ pain with passive right hip extension [^111mMYUn]
- **Obturator sign**: RLQ pain with internal rotation of the flexed right hip [^111NC37S]
- **Dunphy's sign**: RLQ pain with coughing [^1169JEG2]
- **Markle's sign**: RLQ pain with heel-drop or jarring [^1169JEG2]

---

### Rectal and pelvic examination

Perform a **rectal exam** to assess for tenderness or a mass suggesting a retrocecal or pelvic appendix [^113sunE7], and a **pelvic exam** in females to evaluate gynecologic causes such as PID or ectopic pregnancy [^111kDKdj].

---

## Clinical scoring systems

Clinical scoring systems help **stratify risk** and guide imaging and management:

| **Score** | **Components** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Alvarado score | - Migration of pain <br/> - Anorexia <br/> - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - RLQ tenderness <br/> - Rebound <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Neutrophilia | - Useful for ruling out appendicitis at low scores <br/> - Limited specificity for ruling in [^111FnDHw] [^117G1C28] |
| Pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) | - RLQ tenderness <br/> - Cough/percussion/hopping pain <br/> - Anorexia <br/> - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Neutrophilia | - Useful in pediatric patients <br/> - Validated cutoffs [^111FnDHw] |
| Appendicitis inflammatory response (AIR) score | - Vomiting <br/> - RLQ pain <br/> - Rebound <br/> - Fever <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Neutrophilia <br/> - CRP | - Outperforms Alvarado in some studies <br/> - Useful for risk stratification [^1119dkoT] [^111u63nW] |

---

## Imaging considerations

Imaging is recommended after initial clinical assessment and risk stratification [^115AJ9PZ]. Use **ultrasound first line** in children and pregnant patients, acknowledging operator dependence [^1179vQCb] [^116xsjyA]; prefer **CT** in adults for high sensitivity and specificity [^113EpF3D]; and consider **MRI** in pregnancy or when radiation is a concern [^113UPbSF].

---

A focused HPI and exam — emphasizing **pain migration**, **pain before vomiting**, RLQ tenderness, and peritoneal signs — combined with clinical scores and appropriate imaging, enables **accurate diagnosis and timely management** of acute appendicitis [^113sunE7] [^112kVqGy] [^1179vQCb].

### Acute appendicitis: Efficient diagnosis and management [^111NC37S]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in adults and children, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in males and 6.7% in females. It is also the most common non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Findings from the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies aid in diagnosing acute appendicitis. Right lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and periumbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant are key indicators for diagnosing acute appendicitis in adults. In children, absent or decreased bowel sounds, a positive psoas sign, a positive obturator sign, and a positive Rovsing sign are most reliable for the diagnosis.

The Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score incorporate common clinical and laboratory findings to stratify patients as low, moderate, or high risk, aiding in a timely diagnosis. Recommended first-line imaging consists of point-of-care or formal ultrasonography. Appendectomy via open laparotomy or laparoscopy remains the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. However, intravenous antibiotics may be considered first-line therapy in selected patients. Effective pain control with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen should be prioritized, as it does not result in delayed or unnecessary intervention.

Perforation, which can lead to sepsis, occurs in 17% to 32% of patients with acute appendicitis. Prolonged symptom duration before surgical intervention increases this risk. In moderate- to high-risk patients, a surgical consultation should be sought promptly to mitigate complications.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: Ultrasound first [^116xsjyA]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of appendicitis:

- **Clinical signs and symptoms**: According to experts, acute appendicitis (AA) might be referred to as simple AA in the absence of gangrene, perforation, or an abscess around the inflamed appendix. It is termed complicated AA when perforation, gangrene, or periappendicular abscesses are present. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting complaint, followed by vomiting with the migration of the pain to the right iliac fossa, a symptom first described by J. Murphy in 1904. However, this classical presentation is often absent, either due to variation in the anatomic position of the appendix or the age of the patient, with atypical presentations frequently seen in infants and elderly patients.

- **Laboratory markers**: A comprehensive review of laboratory markers for diagnosing AA is provided by DJ Shogilev et al. The degree of white blood cell elevation, the value of C-reactive protein, the proportion of polymorphonuclear cells, a history of fever, and other factors have been studied extensively for AA diagnosis but lack sufficient specificity either alone or in combination. Conversely, the absence of all these laboratory parameters can potentially rule out the diagnosis of AA.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis in adults: A review [^113sunE7]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with an annual incidence of 96.5 to 100 cases per 100,000 adults. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on history and physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Classic symptoms of appendicitis include vague periumbilical pain, anorexia, nausea, intermittent vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and low-grade fever. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made in approximately 90% of patients presenting with these symptoms.

Laparoscopic appendectomy remains the most common treatment. However, increasing evidence suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy or combination therapy with either cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones with metronidazole, successfully treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in approximately 70% of patients. Specific imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), such as appendiceal dilation (appendiceal diameter ≥ 7 mm) or presence of appendicoliths, defined as the conglomeration of feces in the appendiceal lumen, identify patients for whom an antibiotics-first management strategy is more likely to fail. CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, and a dilated appendix greater than 13 mm are associated with a higher risk of treatment failure (≈40%) of an antibiotics-first approach. Therefore, surgical management should be recommended in patients with CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, or a dilated appendix who are fit for surgery.

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^117MKxs4]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The literature search yielded over 3,000 titles and abstracts for screening. The full text of 91 articles met the eligibility criteria, and these articles were retrieved (Figure 2). Thirty-seven articles were included from the search, and a further five articles were retrieved after citation searching, resulting in a total of 42 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The included studies came from a variety of settings and countries.

Nine studies took place in a surgical ward, three studies specified only that patients were hospitalized, and all remaining studies were performed in an emergency department setting. Detailed characteristics of all included studies are presented in Table 1.

- **Quality assessment results**: The overall quality of the included studies is considered acceptable for most of the quality items. The assessment of the clinical variables composing the Alvarado score and the reference standard for diagnosis (histological results of the appendectomy) were interpreted independently in most studies. The retrospective studies rarely reported if the scorer was aware of the final diagnosis (blind assessment). The quality item, 'time between tests', which refers to the time between administering the Alvarado score and verifying the diagnosis with pathology or follow-up, was very poorly reported. As part of our inclusion criteria, all studies had to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis in those undergoing appendectomy; however, follow-up of those discharged was poor in the majority of studies.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^117B5yz6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Determining the best moment to perform surgery in cases of acute appendicitis is of crucial importance. Acute appendicitis has traditionally been considered an irreversible progressive disease, although recent studies have questioned this dogma. Currently, it is endorsed that two types of appendicitis exist: uncomplicated (non-perforating) and complicated (perforating) appendicitis. The etiology and pathogenesis of acute appendicitis remain largely unknown, and predicting a mild or fulminant course of appendicitis is not possible. Delaying an appendectomy increases the risk of perforated appendicitis, which is associated with a higher incidence of short and long-term morbidity. Hence, it is recommended to perform an appendectomy as soon as possible, although some studies have revealed that the clinical outcome was not affected by time to surgery when the surgery was performed within 12 hours after presentation at the emergency department.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (e.g. acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are necessarily related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^111akP1a]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of an acute abdomen requiring surgery, with a lifetime risk of about 7%. Symptoms of appendicitis overlap with a number of other conditions, making diagnosis a challenge, particularly at an early stage of presentation. Patients may be suitably triaged into alternative management strategies: reassurance, pursuit of an alternative diagnosis, or observation/admission to hospital. If admitted to hospital, appropriate imaging may be required prior to proceeding to an appendectomy.

Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) quantify the diagnosis of a target disorder based on findings of key symptoms, signs, and available diagnostic tests, thus having an independent diagnostic or prognostic value. They can also extend into clinical decision-making if probability estimates are linked to management recommendations, and are subsequently referred to as clinical decision rules. CPRs have the potential to reduce diagnostic error, increase quality, and enhance appropriate patient care. In 1986, Alvarado constructed a 10-point clinical scoring system, also known by the acronym MANTRELS, for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis based on symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests in patients presenting with suspected acute appendicitis.

- **Probability of appendicitis by the Alvarado score**: The Alvarado score enables risk stratification in patients presenting with abdominal pain, linking the probability of appendicitis to recommendations regarding discharge, observation, or subsequent clinical management strategy.

### Acute appendicitis: Efficient diagnosis and management [^113ETXhL]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute appendicitis, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of the Alvarado score. Combined with point-of-care or formal ultrasound and laboratory testing, it aids in diagnosing acute appendicitis and helps reduce the use of CT.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^113UPbSF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in pregnant patients and children with inconclusive findings at ultrasonography. A recent meta-analysis on MRI in 363 patients with appendicitis yielded a sensitivity rate of 97% [95% CI 92–99%], a specificity rate of 95% [95% CI 94–99%], a positive likelihood ratio of 16.3 [95% CI 9.10–29.10], and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.09 [95% CI 0.04–0.20]. These rates are comparable to those of CT imaging, although these findings should be interpreted with care, as most studies have been performed in a selected group of patients. MRI is associated with significant costs, and interpreting the images requires experience. Therefore, at present, the use of MRI appears limited to pregnant women and children.

- **Algorithm associated with the Alvarado score**:
	- The cut-off values are based on the study by Ebell et al.
	- Additional imaging studies may be considered in patients with a high probability based on the Alvarado score to reduce the negative appendectomy rate.
	- Ultrasound should be performed as a first-level diagnostic imaging study. However, in specific patient groups (such as the obese), an immediate CT scan might be considered.
	- In case of an inconclusive result from the ultrasound, additional imaging studies should be performed. Either a CT or MRI is preferred, although it is recommended to perform an MRI in children and pregnant patients. It is therefore necessary to rule out pregnancy before a CT scan is obtained.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^115HUxd9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Unequivocal international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with acute appendicitis are lacking. The aim of the 2015 consensus meeting of the EAES was to generate a European guideline based on the best available evidence and expert opinions from a panel of EAES members. Following a systematic review of the literature by an international group of surgical research fellows, an expert panel with extensive clinical experience in the management of appendicitis discussed statements and recommendations.

Statements and recommendations with more than 70% agreement by the experts were selected for a web survey and the consensus meeting of the EAES in Bucharest in June 2015. EAES members and attendees at the EAES meeting in Bucharest could vote on these statements and recommendations. In cases of more than 70% agreement, the statement or recommendation was defined as supported by the scientific community. Results from both the web survey and the consensus meeting in Bucharest are presented as percentages.

In total, 46 statements and recommendations were selected for the web survey and consensus meeting. More than 232 members and attendees voted on them. In 41 of the 46 statements and recommendations, more than 70% agreement was reached. All 46 statements and recommendations are presented in this paper. They comprise topics regarding the diagnostic work-up, treatment indications, procedural aspects, and post-operative care. The consensus meeting produced these statements and recommendations on the diagnostic work-up and management of appendicitis.

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: A systematic review [^117G1C28]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Alvarado score can be used to stratify patients with symptoms of suspected appendicitis; the validity of the score in certain patient groups and at different cut points is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the discrimination (diagnostic accuracy) and calibration performance of the Alvarado score.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of validation studies in Medline, Embase, DARE, and The Cochrane Library was performed up to April 2011. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the score at two cut-off points: score of 5 (1 to 4 vs. 5 to 10) and score of 7 (1 to 6 vs. 7 to 10). Calibration was analyzed across low (1 to 4), intermediate (5 to 6), and high (7 to 10) risk strata. The analysis focused on three sub-groups: men, women, and children.

- **Results**: Forty-two studies were included in the review. In terms of diagnostic accuracy, the cut-point of 5 was good at 'ruling out' admission for appendicitis (sensitivity 99% overall, 96% men, 99% women, 99% children). At the cut-point of 7, recommended for 'ruling in' appendicitis and progression to surgery, the score performed poorly in each subgroup (specificity overall 81%, men 57%, women 73%, children 76%). The Alvarado score is well calibrated in men across all risk strata (low RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28; intermediate 1.09, 0.86 to 1.37; and high 1.02, 0.97 to 1.08). The score over-predicts the probability of appendicitis in children in the intermediate and high-risk groups and in women across all risk strata.

- **Conclusions**: The Alvarado score is a useful diagnostic 'rule out' score at a cut point of 5.

### Does this child have appendicitis [^115VuY6i]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation aids in identifying:

- **Children requiring immediate surgical consultation**: Those with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should be considered for potential appendectomy.
- **Children needing further diagnostic evaluation**: Those with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo additional diagnostic measures.

The objective of this study was to systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

- **Data sources**: English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database were searched, along with physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2,521 potentially relevant articles.

- **Study selection**: Studies included had to provide primary data on children aged 18 years or younger where appendicitis was considered. They presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data, and confirmed or excluded appendicitis through surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Out of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met the inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Twenty-five of the 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers.

- **Results**: In children with abdominal pain, fever was identified as the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis.

### Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the presentation of paediatric acute appendicitis: An observational study [^111qaWD9]. Clinical Radiology (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there were differences in the clinical presentation of patients imaged to evaluate for acute appendicitis in 2020 compared to 2019. This information might better identify patients who should undergo imaging work-up and those who should not.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective observational study included patients under 18 years who were evaluated for appendicitis between 1 March and 31 May in 2019 and 2020. A total of 465 patients were stratified by final diagnosis (appendicitis versus not appendicitis) and compared based on presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, vital signs, and laboratory test results.

- **Results**: Symptoms and physical examination findings that were significant in the positive cohort in both years included right lower quadrant pain, pain with movement, migration of pain, right lower quadrant tenderness, and peritoneal findings. Reporting upper respiratory symptoms was an independent predictor of negative results among all patients and in 2019. Both negative cohorts were more likely to have negative physical examinations. Anorexia and nausea/vomiting were more likely among positive cases in 2019, whereas diarrhoea was more likely among positive cases in 2020.

- **Conclusions**: The COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly change the presenting features of acute appendicitis. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of the physical examination. The ambiguity of symptoms that mimic gastroenteritis justifies imaging in these patients.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of acute appendicitis: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^111mMYUn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (see Figure 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also exhibit certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen — a classic finding of acute appendicitis — which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient lying on their left side. Rovsing's sign can also be observed in acute appendicitis when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

- **Figure 1: Acute appendicitis management**.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urinalysis, and routine chemistry, particularly if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis.

### The utility of the speed bump SIGN for diagnosing acute appendicitis [^115sAFyr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal complaint in the emergency department. This study was conducted to determine whether there is any evidence to support the practice of inquiring about pain over speed bumps in patients suspected of having acute appendicitis and to assess its predictive power as a diagnostic sign.

- **Method**: A prospective study was conducted in the emergency department of Al Ain Hospital over one year. A convenient sample of 100 consecutive adult patients over the age of 15 years who presented with abdominal pain and symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis were recruited over the study period. They all completed a questionnaire regarding whether they experienced pain, or if their pain increased, while traveling over speed bumps.

- **Results**: The study shows that 80 of the 90 participants were "speed bump positive". Eighty-five had a confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis, 77 of whom had worsened pain over speed bumps, giving a sensitivity of 90.5% and a specificity of 40%. The positive predictive value was 96.25%, and the negative predictive value was 20%. The likelihood ratios were 1.5 for a positive test result and 0.23 for a negative result.

- **Conclusion**: Pain over speed bumps can be considered a significant "rule out" criterion for appendicitis due to the high sensitivity observed in this study. However, with its low specificity, many patients with this sign may not undoubtedly have appendicitis, meaning it is a poor "rule-in" test.

### Clinical approach to a child with abdominal pain who might have appendicitis [^112bSawA]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Appendicitis can usually be diagnosed following the completion of a history and physical examination, which includes abdominal pain, vomiting, right lower quadrant tenderness, and guarding. Laboratory evaluations, such as urinalysis and white blood cell count, can also assist. In a few cases where doubt remains, plain films of the chest and abdomen can be helpful. The question of whether and when further imaging is indicated remains controversial.

We reviewed reports of studies published since 2003 in which the sensitivity and specificity of CT and sonography for diagnosing appendicitis were determined. Sonography had an average sensitivity of 87.1% and an average specificity of 89.2% across nine studies reported during that period. The average sensitivity of CT was 90.8% in 11 studies during that period, with an average specificity of 94.2% in 10 studies.

Additionally, we examined data from 299 patients who underwent appendectomies at our hospital. Of the appendices removed, 10.7% did not have appendicitis. In many cases, CT or US imaging data were available as reports or images or both from outside institutions. CT and US images were also available from our institution when the diagnosis was in question. This reflects the real-world scenario, where patients present with studies that might not be the best, might not have been indicated, and might not have images available for re-interpretation. Among patients operated on with neither CT nor US images, 10.9% did not have appendicitis. Among those who underwent US imaging, 11.1% were negative for appendicitis, and among those in whomPLICATE the sentence structure and readability without losing the original meaning.

### Comprehensive review of typical and atypical pathology of the appendix on CT: Cases with clinical implications [^1172MiZg]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the United States, with approximately 250,000 cases annually. Computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the most accurate diagnostic test to triage these patients for emergent surgery. Although the radiology search pattern is prioritized to detect an inflamed appendix, not all appearances equate to a typical surgical appendicitis. There are a select set of atypical pathologies involving the appendix that have subtle differences on CT but can have catastrophic complications if treated with emergent appendectomy. This paper reviews the spectrum of CT appearances and clinical management for typical and atypical appendiceal pathologies.

### Clinical value of total white blood cells and neutrophil counts in patients with suspected appendicitis: Retrospective study [^111HgN41]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common abdominal emergencies. Although patients with AA often present with a characteristic symptom complex and physical findings, atypical presentations are common. Missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to increased rates of perforation and morbidity. The clinical diagnosis of AA is difficult, and management errors are frequent, with rates of negative explorations reaching 20% to 30%. Despite the wide use of imaging techniques, appendicitis remains a challenging diagnosis.

Patients with suspected appendicitis are mainly managed on the basis of their disease history and physical examination; the value of laboratory examinations is controversial. Some works have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of different inflammatory markers in appendicitis, with heterogeneous designs and results. These markers include total white blood cells (WBCs), granulocytes, C-reactive protein, leukocyte elastase activity, D-lactate, phospholipase A2, and interleukin-6.

Studies have shown inconsistent information regarding the use of WBC count and differential in AA diagnosis. Although most studies show an association between elevated WBC count in appendicitis diagnosis, its significance varies greatly. Another question is whether a normal WBC count and differential can adequately rule out a diagnosis of appendicitis. There have been reports of high negative predictive values (NPVs > 90%) for normal WBC count and differential.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of total WBCs and neutrophils.

### The use of the clinical scoring system by Alvarado in the decision to perform computed tomography for acute appendicitis in the ED [^114kd7hy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is part of the differential of an acute abdomen and can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Strategies to suggest which patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) should undergo computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm appendicitis have not been addressed. We develop guidelines for CT scanning based on Alvarado clinical scores for patients with suspected and confirmed cases of appendicitis.

- **Study objective**: A retrospective review of 150 charts of patients aged 7 and older who presented with abdominal pain to the ED of a 392-bed acute care facility over a 6-month period were evaluated by ED physicians and underwent CT to rule out appendicitis. Patient demographics, presenting signs, and symptoms were documented. Using the scoring system for appendicitis, developed by Alvarado, each chart was retrospectively scored. The Alvarado scores were correlated with positive pathology findings, as well as Alvarado scores with a negative CT scan. Equivocal scores, having neither high sensitivity nor specificity for appendicitis, were calculated.

- **Results**: Computed tomography scans with Alvarado scores of 3 or lower were performed in 37% (55/150) of patients to rule out appendicitis. The sensitivity of Alvarado scores 3 or lower for not having appendicitis was 96.2% (53/55), and the specificity was 67% (2/3). Patients with Alvarado scores 7 or higher had an incidence of acute appendicitis of 77.7% (28/36). The sensitivity of Alvarado scores 7 or higher for appendicitis was 77% (28/36), and the specificity was 100% (8/8).

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^1169JEG2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In resource-limited settings, improving the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis can be effectively achieved by using a method that combines physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests. A mnemonic known as MANTRELS facilitates easy application: Migration, Anorexia, and Nausea or vomiting are the primary symptoms. They are followed by signs including Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, Rebound pain (Blumberg sign), and Elevation of temperature (oral temperature of 37.3 °C or more).

Laboratory tests involve a complete blood count to detect Leukocytosis and a Shift to the left (increased Stabs or Segmented neutrophils), alongside a urinalysis for acetone as an indicator of anorexia if it is not clinically apparent. Rebound pain can also be assessed through indirect signs such as the Rovsing sign, Dunphy's sign (cough test), or Markle's test (heel-drop jarring test). Another alternative is gentle direct percussion with the fist on the right lumbar area to assess tenderness, which is useful in cases of retrocecal acute appendicitis.

In descending order of significance, the eight most predictive factors include: localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant, leukocytosis, migration of pain, shift to the left, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia or acetone presence.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of acute appendicitis: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^116bxKSd]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Imaging of the patient suspected of appendicitis**:

	- **Ultrasound versus computed tomography scan**: Ultrasound (US) has been used to evaluate patients suspected of acute appendicitis and has an 85% to 90% positive predictive value with an appendiceal diameter greater than 9 to 10 mm. It does not use radiation energy, is repeatable, and is safe for pregnant women. It can also demonstrate other pelvic pathology in women. Ultrasound is frequently used in pediatric patients and is favored as an initial study in small children. The utility of US is less well documented in the adult population.

	- Computed tomography scan with contrast has been the standard for imaging the abdomen when searching for acute pathology and is used with increasing frequency in the general diagnosis of abdominal pain, especially by nonsurgeons. It provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but has the potential to identify radiographic abnormalities of the appendix that are not clinically relevant. Computed tomography imaging should always be interpreted in the context of clinical history and physical examination. It can also demonstrate an appendiceal fecalith, periappendiceal fluid collection, or an abscess, findings that may be of importance in clinical decision-making. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of computed tomography (CT) scans based on pathology results were 87.9%, 81.8%, 94.7%, and 79.3%, respectively, in patients with low clinical suspicion.

### Alvarado score: Can it reduce unnecessary CT scans for evaluation of acute appendicitis [^116G9nEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of the study is to assess the utility of the Alvarado score in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the utility of computed tomographic (CT) scan for evaluation of acute appendicitis when stratified by Alvarado scores.

- **Materials and methods**: Retrospective cohort study comprised adult patients who underwent abdominal CT for suspected acute appendicitis between January 2006 and December 2009. Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the CT scans; any discrepancies were resolved by a consensus review. Alvarado scores were calculated and categorized as low (0–3), equivocal (4–6), or high (7–10) probability for appendicitis. The diagnostic utility of CT scans and Alvarado scores for acute appendicitis were compared with the criterion standard of combined medical chart review and pathology findings.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 158 subjects, 73 (46.2%) had clinical diagnoses of acute appendicitis. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CT scan in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 97.5%, 98.6%, 96.5%, 96.0%, and 98.8%, respectively. The mean Alvarado score for subjects with complicated appendicitis was significantly higher (7.95) than subjects with uncomplicated appendicitis (6.67) and those with other diagnoses (5.95). Acute appendicitis was confirmed in 2 (13.3%) of 15 subjects with low probability Alvarado scores, 16 (30.8%) of 52 subjects with equivocal scores, and 55 (60.4%) of 91 subjects with high probability scores.

- **Conclusion**: The CT scan had high diagnostic utility for acute appendicitis.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: A tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^111u63nW]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). High credibility.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical calculator used for diagnosing acute appendicitis. Specifically applicable to patients with acute abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis, the AIR score employs clinical and laboratory parameters. These include fever, nausea, pain migration, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk for appendicitis.

The AIR score aids in the decision-making process regarding the management of suspected appendicitis. It helps identify patients who may require immediate surgical intervention, those who may benefit from further diagnostic imaging, and those who can be safely discharged with close follow-up.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the AIR score. However, its accuracy may be reduced in certain populations such as pregnant women, elderly patients, or those with atypical appendicitis presentations. The AIR score should be used alongside clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The AIR score evaluates the likelihood of appendicitis by analyzing symptoms and lab results. Input variables include vomiting, right iliac fossa pain, rebound tenderness, fever, polymorphonuclear leukocytes percentage, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein levels.

### Prospective evaluation of the ability of clinical scoring systems and physician-determined likelihood of appendicitis to obviate the need for CT [^113iRQ7A]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

To determine whether clinical scoring systems or physician gestalt can obviate the need for computed tomography (CT) in patients with possible appendicitis, a prospective, observational study was conducted. This study, carried out at an academic emergency department from February 2012 to February 2014, enrolled patients over 11 years old who had a CT ordered for possible appendicitis. All parameters necessary for calculating the scores were recorded on standardized forms prior to CT. Additionally, physicians estimated the likelihood of appendicitis. Test characteristics were calculated using clinical follow-up as the reference standard, and receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn.

Of the 287 patients (mean age 31 years, range 12–88 years; 60% women), the prevalence of appendicitis was 33%.

- **Alvarado score**: This score showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR(+)) of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7 to 3) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR(-)) of 0.6 (0.4 to 0.7).

- **Modified Alvarado score (MAS)**: The MAS demonstrated an LR(+) of 2.4 (1.6 to 3.4) and an LR(-) of 0.7 (0.6 to 0.8).

- **Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) score**: This score had an LR(+) of 1.3 (1.1 to 1.5) and an LR(-) of 0.5 (0.4 to 0.8).

- **Physician-determined likelihood**: This method showed an LR(+) of 1.3 (1.2 to 1.5) and an LR(-) of 0.3 (0.2 to 0.6). When combined with physician likelihoods, the results were as follows: Alvarado LR(+) and LR(-) were 3.67 and 0.48, RIPASA 2.33 and 0.45, and MAS 3.87 and 0.47. The area under the curve was highest for physician-determined likelihood (0.72) but was not statistically significantly different from the clinical scores (RIPASA 0.67, Alvarado 0).

### What are the most clinically useful cutoffs for the Alvarado and pediatric appendicitis scores? A systematic review [^111FnDHw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to systematically review the accuracy of the Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score and to identify optimal cutoffs for low- and high-risk populations.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of the literature and identified 26 studies on the accuracy of the Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score. Data were abstracted in parallel, and only prospective cohort studies that avoided verification bias were included. We calculated summary likelihood ratios for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups using all possible cutoffs based on available data, even if not reported in the original study.

- **Results**: The pretest probability of appendicitis was approximately 33% in studies of children and approximately 66% in studies of adults. Likelihood ratios at different cutoffs for the Alvarado score in adults were as follows: 0.03 (< 4 points), 0.42 (4 to 6 points), and 3.4 (≥ 7 points); and 0.01 (< 5 points), 0.98 (5 to 8 points), and 6.7 (≥ 9 points). Likelihood ratios for the Alvarado score in children were as follows: 0.02 (< 4 points), 0.27 (4 to 6 points), and 4.2 (≥ 7 points); and 0.04 (< 5 points), 1.2 (5 to 8 points), and 8.5 (≥ 9 points). For the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, likelihood ratios were 0.13 (< 4 points), 0.70 (4 to 7 points), and 8.1 (≥ 8 points).

- **Conclusion**: For children with a pretest probability of acute appendicitis of 60% or less, an Alvarado score below 4 rules out the diagnosis; this is also true for a score less than 5 if the pretest probability is up to approximately 40%.

### Test characteristics of common appendicitis scores with and without laboratory investigations: a prospective observational study [^1113usf6]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is the most common non-traumatic surgical emergency in the pediatric population, affecting an estimated 80,000 children in the United States annually, at a rate of 4 per 1,000 children under the age of 14 years. Early diagnosis may decrease the risk of progression to perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis, which are major causes of childhood morbidity. Despite its high incidence, diagnosing appendicitis can be difficult due to the non-specific or atypical nature of its symptoms. Numerous scoring systems, such as the Alvarado score (AS), the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS), and the Lintula score (LS), have been developed to assist clinicians in recognizing which children presenting with abdominal pain are at the greatest risk of having appendicitis. These clinical scores are based on elements of history and physical exam, with the majority incorporating basic laboratory investigations, including the White Blood Cell (WBC) and Neutrophil counts (NC).

- **Table of scoring systems**:
	- Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Lintula score. Components based on laboratory investigation have been underlined.

Use of the WBC count in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is subject to several limitations. First, children with abdominal pain often first present to primary care providers or walk-in clinics where laboratory resources may not be available. From the patient perspective, bloodwork causes pain, distress, and anxiety. In addition, the time required for the completion of the WBC and NC may increase the time to diagnosis and surgical intervention.

### Can ruptured appendicitis be detected preoperatively in the ed [^113AD1tL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to determine which clinical symptoms/signs and computed tomography (CT) signs can help in distinguishing ruptured from simple appendicitis.

The medical records and CT findings of 202 consecutive patients with surgically proven acute appendicitis were retrospectively reviewed and compared between two groups with and without appendiceal rupture.

Longer duration of symptoms (P < .001), peritoneal sign (P = 0.004), and higher C-reactive protein (P < .001) are significant clinical factors for predicting appendiceal rupture in acute appendicitis. Significant CT signs for predicting appendiceal rupture include abscess, extraluminal air, wall defect, peritoneal enhancement, extraluminal appendolith, phlegmon, localized fluid, fascial thickening, ascites, stool impaction, and four patterns of bowel wall thickening (P < .001 to P = 0.047). The appendiceal diameter is larger in patients with ruptured appendicitis than in those with simple appendicitis (13.2 ± 3.2 vs 11.3 ± 2.4 mm, P < .001). The appendolith size is larger in patients with ruptured appendicitis than in those with simple appendicitis (7.1 ± 4.4 vs 5.1 ± 2.8 mm, P = 0.018).

Besides some clinical findings, CT scan can accurately determine appendiceal rupture in acute appendicitis and can further demonstrate the presence of local inflammatory mass, facilitating management decision in the emergency department (ED).

### Is "pain before vomiting" useful? Diagnostic performance of the classic patient history item in acute appendicitis [^113FoVyH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In most surgical textbooks, it has been stated that pain almost always precedes vomiting in patients with appendicitis. However, the usefulness of this classic history item, "pain before vomiting", has been investigated in only one study nearly 50 years ago, in which the cause of abdominal pain could not be identified in more than 40% of patients. Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the performance of pain before vomiting for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients who presented with both acute abdominal pain and vomiting.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of adult outpatients with abdominal pain and vomiting at three acute care hospitals was performed. The reference standard for appendicitis was a CT scan evaluated by two radiologists. Diagnostic performance of pain before vomiting and the value it added to the Alvarado score were evaluated.

- **Results**: Among 310 patients, 24 patients were diagnosed with appendicitis. Diagnostic performance of pain before vomiting was a sensitivity of 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.8–99.3) and a specificity of 16.6% (95% CI 12.6–21.4). When combined with the Alvarado score, it ruled out appendicitis in an additional 12% (increased from 32% to 44%) of patients without any false negatives.

- **Conclusions**: "Pain before vomiting" is useful for ruling out appendicitis in patients with abdominal pain and vomiting.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^114vdSUK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The on-admission findings of an appendiceal diameter ≥ 15 mm and a body temperature > 38°C were prognostic factors for non-responsiveness in this study, corroborating previously reported studies. Patients with a larger appendiceal diameter may not be optimal candidates for non-operative management, and these patients should be considered for emergency appendectomy. The large CODA trial found that female sex was associated with an increased risk of appendectomy within the first 30 days of initial antibiotics. In contrast, this study found that female sex did not increase the risk of appendectomy for complicated acute appendicitis, indicating true non-responsiveness and highlighting the need for more disease-related objective tools to assess the effectiveness of initiated treatments.

- **Appendicitis severity assessment**: Besides single characteristics evaluating appendicitis severity, efforts have been made towards a composite endpoint. The recently published Scoring System of Appendicitis Severity (SAS) 2.0 assesses the probability of having complicated disease by combining objective clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and one subjective parameter of numeric pain rating scale. However, SAS 2.0 does not provide any treatment recommendations; it is merely a tool for improving the differential diagnosis of appendicitis severity. Wider appendiceal diameter, higher body temperature, and the presence of an appendicolith are taken into account in SAS 2.0.

Given the substantial evidence from multiple RCTs supporting the safety and efficacy of antibiotics for acute appendicitis, the present study also aimed to address these factors.

### Poor sensitivity of a modified Alvarado score in adults with suspected appendicitis [^112YGtPW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A clinical decision rule that identifies patients at low risk for appendicitis may reduce the reliance on computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis. We seek to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of a low modified Alvarado score in emergency department (ED) patients with suspected appendicitis and compare the score to clinical judgment. We hypothesize that a low modified Alvarado score will have a sufficiently high sensitivity to rule out acute appendicitis.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective observational study of adult patients with suspected appendicitis at two academic urban EDs. A low modified Alvarado score was defined as less than 4. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for a low modified Alvarado score, and a final diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed by CT, laparotomy, or 7-day follow-up.

- **Results**: Two hundred sixty-one patients were included for analysis (mean age 35 years [range 18 to 89 years], 68% female patients, 52% white). Fifty-three patients (20%) had acute appendicitis. The modified Alvarado score test characteristics demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 72% (95% CI 58% to 84%) and 54% (95% CI 47% to 61%), respectively. Unstructured clinical judgment that appendicitis was either the most likely or second most likely diagnosis demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 93% (95% CI 82% to 98%) and 33% (95% CI 27% to 40%), respectively.

- **Conclusion**: With a sensitivity of 72%, a low modified Alvarado score is less sensitive than clinical judgment in excluding acute appendicitis.

### Developing and validating of Ramathibodi appendicitis score (RAMA-AS) for diagnosis of appendicitis in suspected appendicitis patients [^111fLfyn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The high-risk group requires all symptoms and signs, or all symptoms plus one sign and laboratory test, all symptoms plus two signs plus any laboratory test, or three symptoms plus two laboratory tests plus any of the signs. The post-test probability is about 93.0%; thus, surgical treatment should be performed for high-risk patients.

Our study has some strengths. We followed the recommendations for developing risk prediction scores by Altman et al. and TRIPOD. We developed, both internally and externally validated the scores using prospective data collections. Imputation of missing data was applied, even though it occurred only in a few variables, which should yield better performance of the risk prediction model than analysis of the complete case only. The RAMA-AS showed good performance for both calibration and discrimination in the derived setting, although one external setting had lower discrimination performance.

However, some limitations could not be avoided. The study was conducted at tertiary hospitals where the appendicitis prevalence was high. The RAMA-AS should be further validated in different populations and settings. To improve generalizability, big electronic health data or individual patient meta-analysis should be conducted. The clinical impact of the RAMA-AS should also be further assessed. For instance, applying the score in a routine clinical practice will help determine whether our score can still well rule out and rule in suspected patients with and without appendicitis. These suspected patients may be only observed or treated with surgery.

### Ultrasound assessment of acute appendicitis in paediatric patients: Methodology and pictorial overview of findings seen [^1142T7U2]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The ultrasound (US) examination of a paediatric patient, where appendicitis is suspected, includes the examination of the abdominal organs with a curvilinear probe. This is followed by graded compression of the right colon and appendix using a linear-array probe. The process should be executed systematically to maximize the likelihood of identifying the appendix and detecting features indicative of appendicitis.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^114wFAj5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

- **Pre-operative care**: Establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis remains challenging. The clinical presentation of acute appendicitis can vary from mild symptoms to signs of generalized peritonitis and sepsis. Hence, the value of individual clinical variables to determine the likelihood of acute appendicitis in a patient is low. Biochemical testing is performed routinely in most patients. Its value in confirming acute appendicitis is debatable. A recent systematic review showed that elevated C-reactive protein levels render the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by increased numbers of leukocytes, with an area under the curve of 0.75 [95% CI 0.71–0.78] and 0.72 [95% CI 0.68–0.76], respectively. The area under the curve represents the ability of a test to correctly classify patients. If the score is between 0.7 and 0.8, it represents a fair test.

Both clinical and biochemical variables have been combined into clinical predicting rules (CPR), such as the Alvarado score and pediatric appendicitis score (PAS). This was done to increase the value of the individual variables. Ohle et al. demonstrated that the Alvarado score was good at "ruling-out" appendicitis, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 81%, respectively. In children, however, it has been shown that the PAS outperforms the Alvarado score. To increase the predictive value of these two tests, Ebell et al. identified new cut-off values for the Alvarado score and PAS, which improved sensitivity and specificity rates. Based on the Alvarado score, patients can now be categorized into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups.

### Evaluation of appendicitis risk prediction models in adults with suspected appendicitis [^111XTgtD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Eligible patients were identified from participating centers during one of four prespecified 2-week study periods between 13 March 2017 and 18 June 2017. During each interval, all consecutive patients referred by a general practitioner or emergency physician to the on-call surgeon's team with suspected appendicitis or acute right iliac fossa (RIF) pain were identified at the point of admission to the surgical unit. Patients who had previously undergone either a therapeutic appendicectomy or an incidental appendicectomy as part of another procedure were excluded. Pregnant women have significantly different clinical needs compared to other patients and were therefore excluded. Pregnancy was identified by patients' self-report, with the possibility further excluded by most women undergoing urinalysis. Patients who underwent appendicectomy for whom histological findings were unavailable were excluded, as it was not possible to determine the underlying diagnosis (appendicitis versus normal appendicectomy) for them. Patients who were managed without surgery for acute appendicitis following a positive CT or MRI diagnosis of appendicitis were also excluded, as the diagnosis was not confirmed histologically.

A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was confirmed if, within 30 days of enrollment in the study, the patient had excision of the appendix with postoperative histological examination confirming acute appendicitis. Patients who underwent right hemicolectomy for presumed acute appendicitis were pooled with those who had appendicectomy.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Suspected acute appendicitis: Trends in management over 30 years [^112jmpJo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Tradition taught that patients with signs suspicious of acute appendicitis should be explored surgically, but studies in the 1960s found that if this group was closely observed, about one-third recovered without treatment. To differentiate these patients, a strict regimen of active observation was introduced and this has now been studied over 30 years. Ultrasonography, laparoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) have also been used to clarify the diagnosis in these patients.

- **Methods**: Papers on the management of patients with suspected appendicitis published since 1970 were traced through Index Medicus, English-language journals, and Medline. All those that mention the use of observation are reviewed, with selective reports on the other methods used. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of management are compared.

- **Results and Conclusion**: Active observation has yielded a consistently low negative appendicectomy rate without a rise in the perforation rate; there was one death in over 1600 patients. It has proved to be a practical method of discriminating between patients who do and do not need an operation. In this situation, both ultrasonography and CT yield some false-negative reports, so results must be checked at the bedside. Furthermore, CT involves exposure to significant doses of radiation.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful; for example, constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction, whereas others, such as anorexia, have little predictive value for appendicitis. The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain.

It is also important to consider special populations, such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^112ZGheK]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although the Alvarado score was developed in a mixed-gender population, the ratio of men to women was 1.4:1. The score has subsequently been shown to perform poorly when applied to women of child-bearing age. It is also possible that a certain loss of diagnostic information may have occurred due to dichotomization when the score was originally constructed in the derivation study. Abdominal pain in women is a diagnostically challenging symptom as there are more diagnostic possibilities aside from appendicitis, such as pelvic inflammatory disease and other gynecological pathologies.

Alternative risk scores or CPRs, such as Lindeberg, Eskelinen, and Fenyo scores for appendicitis, have different numerical values for symptoms depending on whether the patient is male or female. The Van Way, Teicher, and Arnbjornssion scores include gender as one of their components. Of note, Ohman et al. reported that the Alvarado score outperformed each of these other scores.

Distinguishing appendicitis from other causes of abdominal pain in children is also challenging, particularly in young children who cannot articulate how they feel or where the pain is. There is a wide variation in presenting symptoms, making it difficult to elicit the classical presentation. The use of symptoms and signs to identify children at risk of acute appendicitis is particularly appealing, as diagnostic imaging using a CT scan exposes children to ionizing radiation, and the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is still uncertain. A recent review found that "fever" in a child…

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^115Kx1L8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). High credibility.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986, this score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

It is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, aiding clinicians in deciding whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. The score applies to all age groups but should be used with caution in pregnant women due to potential atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population. Additionally, it is not recommended for patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic appendicitis symptoms, as these could skew the results.

- **Right lower quadrant tenderness**: Worth 2 points.
- **Elevated temperature**: A temperature higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius adds 1 point.

The Alvarado Score involves a checklist of symptoms and signs, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values provides a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

### The Alvarado score for predicting acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^115ixmVs]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Alvarado score can be used to stratify patients with symptoms of suspected appendicitis; however, its validity in certain patient groups and at different cut points remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the discrimination (diagnostic accuracy) and calibration performance of the Alvarado score.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of validation studies was conducted in Medline, Embase, DARE, and The Cochrane Library up to April 2011. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the score at two cut-off points: a score of 5 (1 to 4 vs. 5 to 10) and a score of 7 (1 to 6 vs. 7 to 10). Calibration was analyzed across low (1 to 4), intermediate (5 to 6), and high (7 to 10) risk strata. The analysis focused on three sub-groups: men, women, and children.

- **Results**: Forty-two studies were included in the review. In terms of diagnostic accuracy, the cut-point of 5 was effective for 'ruling out' admission for appendicitis, with sensitivity of 99% overall (96% men, 99% women, 99% children). At the cut-point of 7, recommended for 'ruling in' appendicitis and progression to surgery, the score performed poorly in each subgroup, with specificity overall at 81% (men 57%, women 73%, children 76%). The Alvarado score is well calibrated in men across all risk strata (low RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28; intermediate 1.09, 0.86 to 1.37; high 1.02, 0.97 to 1.08). However, the score over-predicts the probability of appendicitis in children in the intermediate and high-risk groups and in women across all risk strata.

- **Conclusions**: The Alvarado score is a useful diagnostic 'rule out' score at a cut point of 5.

Classic appendicitis is a common condition that is easily diagnosed by emergency care providers. However, atypical cases present a diagnostic challenge and can contribute to increased morbidity due to delays in definitive care. It is important to recognize that atypical presentations pose an increased risk for underlying anatomic variants, which may require additional imaging as part of management. We present a case of a 13-year-old previously healthy adolescent boy with an acute onset of left-sided abdominal pain, who was found to have appendicitis in the context of underlying malrotation.

Concerns about radiation exposure have led to a decrease in the use of computed tomography in suspected appendicitis, with increased reliance on ultrasound. Children with suspected appendicitis should be risk stratified using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, white blood cell count, and ultrasound in order to guide further evaluation and management. Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising imaging modality but remains costly. Ongoing research is evaluating the role of nonoperative management in children with confirmed appendicitis.

### History of appendectomy? An atypical case of recurrent abdominal pain [^115w1iGU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a common condition that emergency physicians encounter during pediatric emergency visits. Stump appendicitis, an acute inflammation of the residual appendicular tissue, is a rare post-operative complication with a reported incidence of 1 in 50,000 appendectomies. The diagnosis of stump appendicitis is time-critical to prevent associated morbidities, including abscess formation, perforation, and sepsis.

Another atypical presentation of appendicitis includes reappendicitis, which is characterized by one or more previous episodes of similar clinical presentations as acute appendicitis, with symptoms subsiding within 24 to 48 hours. Intervals between attacks may vary from weeks to years, during which the patient may be asymptomatic. Although reappendicitis is rare, emergency physicians should be aware of this possibility and should not assume that a previous appendectomy precludes reappendicitis. This case highlights the importance of considering such an unusual condition in a patient presenting with right-sided abdominal pain again.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^112uJff2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain across all ages, occurring in 7% of the US population and with an incidence of 1.1 cases per 1,000 persons each year. However, it is often a perplexing problem, especially during the early stages of the disease, potentially delaying diagnosis and contributing to persistent morbidity and mortality rates. The classic signs and symptoms are present in only 60 to 70% of cases, indicating the difficulty of ascertaining a correct diagnosis.

Therefore, clinicians must improve their diagnostic acumen by carefully examining these signs and symptoms. When using regular clinical methods, the correct diagnosis can be obtained in 71 to 97% of cases, while the rate of negative appendectomies varies from 14 to 75%. In certain areas of the world, this may reach 85%. The incidence of perforated appendicitis varies between 4 and 45%, and the death rate ranges from 0.17 to 7.5%, peaking at 20% in children under age two.

### Sages guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^115TMznS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer eight key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or non-operative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

- **Results**: Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either with delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms, although it does also indicate uncertainty.

- **Conclusions**: These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

Appendicitis is one of the most common sources of abdominal pain in the emergency setting and is generally considered a straightforward diagnosis. However, atypical appearances, non-visualization, and inconclusive features can make these cases more complicated. The objectives of this article are to review the differential diagnoses for right lower quadrant pain, discuss the imaging characteristics of simple appendicitis on computed tomography (CT), and provide guidance for equivocal cases, complicated appendicitis, and appendicitis mimics. This review will also discuss the identification and management of neoplasms of the appendix.

### Acute appendicitis: proposal of a new comprehensive grading system based on clinical, imaging and laparoscopic findings [^116zjELd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The proposed acute appendicitis grading system includes various grades to assess the condition:

- **Grade 0 (normal looking)**: The grade 0 refers to the common situation a surgeon may face when a patient has a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, yet laparoscopy reveals a macroscopically "normal looking appendix". If the appendix appears normal during laparoscopy, but another disease is identified as the cause of the patient's symptoms, the appendix should remain in situ. A 10-year follow-up study by van Dalen et al. demonstrated the safety of this approach in women.

	- The situation becomes more complicated when the appendix shows no signs of inflammation and no other disease is detectable (Fig. 1). Weighing the disadvantages of a negative appendectomy against the risk of overestimating a case of appendicitis is challenging. Most surgeons still advise performing an appendectomy if symptoms and signs are typical for appendicitis, because in early appendicitis, the inflammation may be restricted to intramural layers.

	- **Figure 1**: A "normal looking appendix" without any other intra-abdominal disease and a suggestive clinical setting. The appendix was removed, and the histopathological study showed intraluminal inflammation (Grade 0).

In surgical cases of pelvic endometriosis, surgeons should preoperatively inform patients that the appendix is often involved, regardless of the presence of symptoms or gross findings concerning the appendix. Furthermore, surgeons should consider the possibility of performing an incidental appendectomy.

### Association of patient belief about success of antibiotics for appendicitis and outcomes: A secondary analysis of the CODA randomized clinical trial [^113ieh39]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Other patient factors, including demographic, clinical, and radiologic variables, were gathered at baseline and used to describe belief groups. These variables have been previously described and are summarized in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 3.

- **Outcomes**: This analysis focused on 3 binary outcomes within the first 30 days after randomization, a window commonly used to describe outcomes for the index episode of appendicitis and consistent with other secondary CODA analyses. Antibiotic treatment consisted of a 10-day course of oral and/or intravenous antibiotics. Appendectomy was recommended for participants in the antibiotics group if diffuse peritonitis or septic shock developed at any time or if worsening signs and symptoms developed after 48 hours of antibiotics; however, these criteria were not required to be met. In the absence of these conditions, participants were encouraged to continue taking antibiotics, and the decision to perform an appendectomy was ultimately made by the treating clinician. Appendectomy status 30 days after randomization was determined by patient surveys.

At 30 days after randomization, participants were surveyed about persistent signs and symptoms of appendicitis. Participants were asked whether they had experienced any of the following symptoms since their last follow-up with study coordinators: pain in the lower right abdominal area (yes/no), tenderness when the lower right abdomen is pressed (yes/no), and fever or body temperature greater than 101 °F (38.3 °C) or shaking chills (yes/no/unsure).

### Predicting acute appendicitis? A comparison of the Alvarado score, the appendicitis inflammatory response score and clinical assessment [^1119dkoT]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with suspected appendicitis pose a diagnostic challenge. The appendicitis inflammatory response (AIR) score has outperformed the Alvarado score in two retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the AIR score and compare its performance in predicting the risk of appendicitis to both the Alvarado score and the clinical impression of a senior surgeon.

- **Methods**: All parameters included in the AIR and Alvarado scores, as well as the initial clinical impression of a senior surgeon, were prospectively recorded on patients referred to the surgical on-call team with acute right iliac fossa pain over a 6-month period. Predictions were correlated with the final diagnosis of appendicitis.

- **Results**: Appendicitis was the final diagnosis in 67 of 182 patients (37%). The three methods of assessment stratified similar proportions (~40%) of patients to a low probability of appendicitis (p = 0.233) with a false negative rate of < 8% that did not differ between the AIR score, Alvarado score, or clinical assessment. The AIR score assigned a smaller proportion of patients to the high probability zone than the Alvarado score (14% vs. 45%) but did so with a substantially higher specificity (97%) and positive predictive value (88%) than the Alvarado score (76% and 65%, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: The AIR score is accurate at excluding appendicitis in those deemed low risk and more accurate at predicting appendicitis than the Alvarado score in those deemed high risk. Its use as the basis for selective CT imaging in those deemed medium risk should be considered.
