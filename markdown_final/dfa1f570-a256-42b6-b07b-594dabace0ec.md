## Question

Can hyperthyroidism-induced tachycardia also cause excessive heat?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperthyroidism-induced tachycardia can cause excessive heat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core thermogenic effects of excess thyroid hormone. Then, I should verify the direct cardiac effects of thyroid hormone and whether tachycardia itself generates clinically meaningful heat. Next, I will examine the thyroid–sympathetic interactions and their net effect on heat balance. After that, I should review clinical evidence linking hyperthyroidism to heat intolerance and hyperthermia. Finally, I will synthesize a causal model and clarify whether tachycardia is a driver or a parallel manifestation of the same underlying process.

> Let me first confirm the thermogenic role of thyroid hormone. Excess thyroid hormone increases basal metabolic rate and stimulates heat production via direct effects on mitochondria, uncoupling proteins, and ATP-consuming processes such as Na+/K+-ATPase and SERCA, which convert chemical energy to heat; this is why heat intolerance and sweating are classic features of hyperthyroidism, and it explains why patients feel hot even when core temperature is not frankly elevated [^1169Goad] [^1155ujiB] [^113S141U].

> Wait, let me verify the direct cardiac effects before I jump to conclusions about tachycardia generating heat. Thyroid hormone upregulates HCN2/HCN4 pacemaker channels and other ion-channel genes, increasing automaticity and heart rate; it also augments contractility and cardiac output, which raises myocardial oxygen consumption and can contribute to a sensation of warmth, but the caloric cost of a faster heart rate alone is modest compared with whole-body thermogenesis and does not by itself explain marked hyperthermia in thyrotoxicosis [^115KS75i] [^1116oZmk] [^112P8RCT].

> Hold on, I should verify the thyroid–sympathetic axis because I initially thought sympathetic overactivity might be the primary driver of both tachycardia and heat; however, emerging data suggest thyroid hormone's chronotropic effects are largely direct on the myocardium, while autonomic changes can modulate heart rate variability and distribution without necessarily dictating mean heart rate, indicating that tachycardia and heat intolerance are parallel consequences of excess thyroid hormone rather than a causal chain of tachycardia → heat production [^113fyVv9] [^114U5DYe] [^111A8ikF].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence linking hyperthyroidism to heat-related symptoms. Multiple authoritative sources list heat intolerance, excessive sweating, and warm, moist skin as core manifestations of thyrotoxicosis; in severe disease, hyperpyrexia is a diagnostic feature of thyroid storm scoring systems, underscoring that excess thyroid hormone can push core temperature upward in life-threatening presentations, though frank fever is uncommon in uncomplicated hyperthyroidism [^113CXPRr] [^111Q7npZ] [^1137jZru] [^1116oZmk].

> I will now examine whether tachycardia itself is a thermogenic driver or simply a co-traveler. Mechanistically, the dominant source of excess heat in hyperthyroidism is tissue-level thermogenesis driven by thyroid hormone, not the mechanical work of the heart; while a faster heart rate increases myocardial oxygen consumption, the caloric contribution to systemic heat is small relative to the global rise in resting energy expenditure, so tachycardia reflects and accompanies — but does not primarily cause — the excess heat state [^1169Goad] [^112P8RCT] [^1116oZmk].

> But wait, what if the patient is in thyroid storm — could the tachycardia then be "causing" the heat? Even in storm, both hyperthermia and tachycardia arise from the same underlying hormone excess and systemic hypermetabolism; management targets both with antithyroid drugs, beta-blockade, iodine, steroids, and aggressive cooling, which supports the concept of a shared pathophysiology rather than a causal sequence from tachycardia to hyperthermia [^112YE4z6] [^1111qKQc] [^1137jZru].

> Let me synthesize the causal model to ensure internal consistency. Excess thyroid hormone increases whole-body thermogenesis and simultaneously accelerates heart rate via direct genomic and non-genomic actions on the myocardium; heat intolerance and sweating reflect increased heat production and cutaneous heat dissipation, while tachycardia reflects heightened chronotropy and inotropy; both are parallel manifestations of the same hormonal excess, with tachycardia not serving as a primary generator of systemic heat burden [^1169Goad] [^115KS75i] [^111Q7npZ].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for treatment. Symptom control relies on beta-blockers to blunt adrenergic manifestations (palpitations, tremor, anxiety, tachycardia) and antithyroid therapy to reduce hormone synthesis; cooling is reserved for severe hyperthermia or storm, reinforcing that the thermogenic problem is hormonal rather than purely cardiac rate–driven [^1147HWXL] [^112YE4z6] [^1111qKQc].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: hyperthyroidism-induced tachycardia does not directly cause excessive heat; rather, both excessive heat and tachycardia are independent, coexisting consequences of excess thyroid hormone acting on metabolic and cardiac tissues, with thermogenesis arising primarily from tissue-level mitochondrial and futile-cycle mechanisms rather than from the heart's mechanical activity [^1169Goad] [^111Q7npZ] [^115KS75i].

---

Hyperthyroidism causes **heat intolerance and excessive sweating** primarily through increased basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis, not via tachycardia itself [^1169Goad] [^1129rcdp]. Tachycardia is a **parallel effect** of excess thyroid hormone and sympathetic stimulation, and while it increases cardiac workload, it does not meaningfully raise core temperature or cause hyperthermia [^1116oZmk]. The sensation of heat in hyperthyroidism is driven by increased energy expenditure and skin vasodilation, with tachycardia serving as a compensatory response rather than a causal factor [^1116oZmk] [^111poiYE].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of heat intolerance in hyperthyroidism

Hyperthyroidism increases **basal metabolic rate (BMR)** and thermogenesis, leading to heat intolerance and sweating [^1169Goad]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Increased mitochondrial activity**: Thyroid hormones upregulate mitochondrial uncoupling proteins and increase ATP utilization, generating heat [^112P8RCT].

- **Stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase**: Increased activity of this pump consumes ATP and releases heat [^1169Goad].

- **Enhanced lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation**: These catabolic processes increase energy expenditure and heat production [^1169Goad].

- **Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation**: Thyroid hormones activate BAT, contributing to thermogenesis even without cold exposure [^114XrnVJ].

These mechanisms collectively increase core body temperature and heat intolerance, independent of heart rate [^notfound].

---

## Relationship between tachycardia and heat production

Tachycardia is a hallmark of hyperthyroidism, driven by **direct effects of thyroid hormones** on the heart and sympathetic stimulation [^115KS75i]. However, tachycardia itself does not significantly increase heat production. The heart's energy expenditure during tachycardia is relatively small compared with systemic thermogenesis, and the heat generated by increased cardiac workload is minimal. Therefore, tachycardia is a **parallel manifestation** of hyperthyroidism rather than a primary cause of heat intolerance [^111XB5Nn].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

Clinical studies and guidelines consistently describe heat intolerance and excessive sweating as core features of hyperthyroidism, whereas tachycardia is listed separately as a cardiovascular symptom. This distinction underscores that tachycardia does not directly cause excessive heat. For example, the **ACC/AHA guidelines** list heat intolerance, excessive sweating, and tachycardia as distinct symptoms of hyperthyroidism, indicating separate pathophysiological mechanisms [^113CXPRr]. The **ATA guidelines** similarly recognize heat intolerance and tachycardia as independent clinical features, reinforcing that tachycardia is not a primary driver of heat intolerance [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding that tachycardia does not cause excessive heat in hyperthyroidism has important clinical implications. Management focuses on controlling thyroid hormone levels and addressing symptoms:

- **Antithyroid medications**: Methimazole or propylthiouracil reduce thyroid hormone synthesis, lowering BMR and thermogenesis [^113L6Sm9].

- **Beta-blockers**: These agents control tachycardia and sympathetic symptoms but do not directly reduce thermogenesis [^1147HWXL].

- **Supportive measures**: Cooling, hydration, and avoiding heat exposure help manage heat intolerance [^1111qKQc].

---

Hyperthyroidism causes **heat intolerance and excessive sweating** primarily through increased basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis, not via tachycardia itself. Tachycardia is a parallel effect of excess thyroid hormone and sympathetic stimulation, and while it increases cardiac workload, it does not meaningfully raise core temperature or cause hyperthermia. The sensation of heat in hyperthyroidism is driven by increased energy expenditure and skin vasodilation, with tachycardia serving as a compensatory response rather than a causal factor.

### Thyrotoxicosis [^116aYCVo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

### Chinese herbal medicines for hyperthyroidism [^112PozfG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperthyroidism is a disease in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormones circulate in the blood. Patients, among other things suffer from tachycardia, warm moist skin and raised body temperature. The treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptom relief and therapy with antithyroid medications, radioiodine and thyroidectomy. Medicinal herbs are used alone or in combination with antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroidism in China and some other countries.

Objectives

To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for treating hyperthyroidism.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of Chinese herbal medicines alone with Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs, radioiodine or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors interviewed authors of all potentially relevant studies by telephone to verify randomisation procedures. One author entered data into a data extraction form and another author verified the results of this procedure.

Main Results

Thirteen relevant trials with 1770 participants were included. All of them were of low quality. Fifty-two studies still need to be assessed because the original authors could not be interviewed. None of these trials analysed mortality, health related quality of life, economic outcomes or compliance. Compared to antithyroid drugs alone the results showed that Chinese herbal medicines combined with antithyroid drugs may offer benefits in lowering relapse rates, reducing the incidence of adverse effects, relieving symptoms, improving thyroid antibody status and thyroid function. Two trials investigated Chinese herbal medicine versus radioiodine and reported improvements in anxiety, tachycardia and heat intolerance. However, thyroid function - with the exception of restored thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) - was not significantly altered.

Authors' Conclusions

The results suggest that traditional Chinese herbal medicines added to other routine treatment have a therapeutic potential for people with hyperthyroidism. However, due to methodological limitations, we could not identify a well-designed trial to provide strong evidence for Chinese traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Thus, we currently cannot recommend any single preparation or formulation for clinical use.

### Central hypothyroidism impairs heart rate stability and prevents thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy and pyrexia [^111Enfzx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Tachycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, and elevated body temperature are major signs of systemic hyperthyroidism, which are considered to reflect the excessive thyroid hormone (TH) action in the respective peripheral tissues. However, recent observations indicate that the central actions of TH also contribute substantially to cardiovascular regulation and thermogenesis. Methods: In this study, we dissect the individual contributions of peripheral TH action versus the central effects in body temperature regulation and cardiovascular functions by taking advantage of mice lacking the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) (M/O double knock-out [dko]), which exhibit elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels while their brain is in a profoundly hypothyroid state. We compared these animals with wild-type (WT) mice that were treated orally with T3 to achieve similarly elevated serum T3 levels, but are centrally hyperthyroid. For the studies, we used radiotelemetry, infrared thermography, gene expression profiling, Western blot analyses, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assays. Results: Our analyses revealed mild hyperthermia and cardiac hypertrophy in T3-treated WT mice but not in M/O dko animals, suggesting that central actions of TH are required for these hyperthyroid phenotypes. Although the average heart rate was unaffected in either model, the M/O dko exhibited an altered heart rate frequency distribution with tachycardic bursts in active periods and bradycardic episodes during resting time, demonstrating that the stabilization of heart rate by the autonomic nervous system can be impaired in centrally hypothyroid animals. Conclusions: Our studies unravel distinct phenotypical traits of hyperthyroidism that depend on an intact central nervous system, and provide valuable insight into the cardiovascular pathology of the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a condition caused by the lack of MCT8 in humans.

Biochemical Effects of TH

Another set of rationales for TH use is based on isolated biochemical findings, which may also be (mis)construed as the basis of ergogenic TH effects. However, such biochemical TH effects established in isolated in vitro systems must be considered at best permissive, that is, required for normal cellular function; however, to ascribe ergogenic effects to these findings requires additional physiological verification of boosted muscle or exercise-related performance in humans or, at least, intact animals above and beyond normal physiological function in vivo. Otherwise, isolated biochemical findings may be considered explanations in search of suitable findings to explain.

TH is a critical regulator of whole-body thermogenesis as manifest by the basal metabolic rate, which is elevated in hyperthyroidism and reduced in hypothyroidism, both of which would reduce physical performance. Such thermogenic effects appear to be explained by TH-induced stimulation of various futile energetic cycles in skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as white and brown fat, mostly through effects on mitochondrial energetics and uncoupling proteins. These futile cycles involve membrane exchangers (sodium-calcium exchanger, L/T type calcium channels, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase [SERCA2], and the ryanodine receptor), all targets of T3 action. However, rather than enhanced organ function, these mechanisms result in deleterious effects of either excess or deficient TH exposure. For example, hyperthyroidism is associated with impaired exercise tolerance, but animal data shows an adaptive response within myocytes and skeletal muscle. T3 administration in pigs shows short-term increase in myocardial cross-sectional size and beta-adrenergic receptor density, resulting in tachycardia and increased oxygen consumption. Increases in lactic acid production are also associated with T3 administration during increased cardiac output, but how this augments or limits performance is unknown. In rats treated with excess T3, blood flow to skeletal muscles during exercise increased up to 3-fold; however, in human subjects, acute elevation of TH did not affect skeletal muscle blood flow or muscle oxygenation during dynamic testing. Sources of energy are also altered during thyrotoxicosis where fatty acids are a preferential fuel source in the early stages of hyperthyroidism but how this affects energy expenditure is unknown. Hence, restoring euthyroid status from hypothyroidism by TH treatment does not imply additional ergogenic benefits of supratherapeutic exogenous TH, especially as the available evidence suggests that hyperthyroidism of any origin would impair exercise capacity.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112YE4z6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Thyroid storm management — recommendation 30 states that a multimodality treatment approach to patients with thyroid storm should be used, including beta-adrenergic blockade, antithyroid drug therapy, inorganic iodide, corticosteroid therapy, aggressive cooling with acetaminophen and cooling blankets, volume resuscitation, respiratory support and monitoring in an intensive care unit, with a strength rating of 1/+00. Life-threatening thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm is described as a rare, occasionally iatrogenic disorder characterized by multisystem involvement and a high mortality rate if not immediately recognized and treated aggressively, and a high index of suspicion for thyroid storm should be maintained in patients with thyrotoxicosis associated with any evidence of systemic decompensation. Precise criteria for thyroid storm include tachycardia, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, hypotension, hyperpyrexia, agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor and coma, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatic failure, and precipitants include abrupt cessation of antithyroid drugs, thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery in a patient with unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis, and a number of acute illnesses unrelated to thyroid disease. The guideline further notes that thyroid storm also occurs rarely following radioactive iodine therapy, that exposure to iodine from the use of iodine-containing contrast agents may be an additional factor in the development of thyroid storm in patients with illnesses unrelated to thyroid disease, and that each pharmacologically accessible step in thyroid hormone production and action is targeted in treatment.

Preparation of patients with TMNG or TA for surgery — if surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with methimazole (MMI) pretreatment, with or without β-adrenergic blockade, and preoperative iodine should not be used in this setting (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Risks of surgery are increased in the presence of thyrotoxicosis, and thyrotoxic crisis during or after the operation can result in extreme hypermetabolism, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, coma, or death.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^11321EGX]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Thyroxine therapy of RTHα patients in high dosage, does not elevate heart rate

Three RTHα patients, harboring a mutation (TRα1A263V) whose loss-of-function can be overcome as demonstrated in previous in vitro studies, were treated with thyroxine in supraphysiologic dosage, leading to suppressed circulating TSH and raised free T3 concentrations (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Although such therapy overcame tissue hormone resistance, as evidenced by elevation of resting energy expenditure or metabolic rate in patients from markedly subnormal to higher levels (Supplementary Fig. 1A), their average heart rate did not increase (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1A) and was significantly lower than in patients with conventional thyrotoxicosis (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1A, and Supplementary Table 1), suggesting possible resistance to TH-induced tachycardia in this disorder.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^111exyft]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterized by overproduction of thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland and affects 1.3% of adults in the United States. Thyrotoxicosis is a state of thyroid hormone excess and may be caused by hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, or exogenous administration. The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are weakness, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance, and the most common signs are a palpable goiter, tachycardia, muscle weakness, and tremor. A low thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) level has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing thyrotoxicosis. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune condition Graves disease, typically diagnosed by the presence of thyroid eye disease, which is pathognomonic, or thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and thyroiditis, which can be differentiated by the pattern of uptake on a radioactive iodine scan. Thionamides (most commonly methimazole) typically induce remission of Graves disease and can control hyperthyroidism caused by multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma. Radioactive iodine resolves hyperthyroidism in more than 90% of patients with Graves disease and toxic multinodular goiter, with hypothyroidism developing in most patients 1 year after treatment. Thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with compressive symptoms from an obstructive goiter.

Hyperthermia syndromes

The hyperthermia syndromes, generally characterized by severely elevated body temperature, include: environmental hyperthermia including heatstroke; drug-induced hyperthermia, including malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and serotonin syndrome; and endocrine causes including thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, and adrenal crisis. Heatstroke is defined clinically as a core temperature greater than 40 °C associated with central nervous system impairment and multisystem organ failure. Classic heat stroke occurs among older, chronically ill, and debilitated individuals during heat waves, wherein a high external temperature overwhelms the body's thermoregulatory capacity to dissipate the heat. Exertional heat stroke typically occurs in young, otherwise healthy individuals undergoing strenuous physical activity, wherein the excessive heat production disrupts usual thermal homeostasis. Complications of heat stroke include rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal and liver failure, and severe metabolic derangements including hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Malignant hyperthermia occurs among patients with inherited mutations in the ryanodine receptor and is characterized by the acute onset of muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and acidosis in response to exposure to inhalational anesthetics or depolarizing paralytic medications. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by the insidious onset of muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and mental status changes that occur because of the administration of centrally-acting dopamine antagonists, usually typical or atypical antipsychotics, but may also include anti-nauseant medications such as metoclopramide. Serotonin syndrome presents with the rapid onset of hyperthermia and other signs of autonomic instability including tachycardia, mydriasis, and diaphoresis, as well as cognitive and neuromuscular changes that may include tremor, hyperreflexia, and clonus in patients with excess central and peripheral serotonergic agonism. Typically, serotonin syndrome occurs following intentional self-poisoning with prescription or illicit serotonergic agents, but may also occur in the context of therapeutic drug use, including antibiotic therapy with linezolid, or inadvertent drug interactions. Endocrine emergencies occasionally present with hyperthermia. While less commonly the case for pheochromocytoma and adrenal crisis, hyperthermia is a common feature of severe thyrotoxicosis, and is one of the diagnostic features of thyroid storm.

Medical Management of GD

Initial Management

Initial management of hyperthyroidism due to GD often occurs while awaiting confirmatory testing. The goals of initial management are to mitigate symptoms of hyperthyroidism using beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and normalize thyroid hormone levels with ATDs.

Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased adrenergic tone like tremors, palpitations, tachycardia, heat intolerance, and anxiety. They should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made. All beta-blockers are equally effective in relieving such symptoms. Propranolol is nonselective beta-blockade that has been historically used to control adrenergic symptoms because it blocks the peripheral conversion of FT4 to FT3. However, its short duration of action and need for multiple doses a day has given way to preferred use of long-acting beta-1 receptor selective blockers like atenolol and metoprolol with once-a-day dosing (Table 2). – In the setting of severe thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm in patients with hemodynamic instability, esmolol drip in the intensive care setting can be considered. Common side effects of beta-blockers are described in Table 2.

As thyroid hormone levels normalize and symptoms resolve, beta-blockers can be tapered and ultimately discontinued. In patients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for beta-adrenergic blockade, calcium-channel blockers like verapamil and diltiazem have been shown to affect rate control.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^113fyVv9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Current knowledge suggests that TH controls heart rate by regulating the expression of Hcn2 and Hcn4 pacemaker channel genes. Furthermore, given known similarities of features of hyperthyroidism or overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, it is thought that TH controls heart rate by stimulation of the SNS. Prompted by clinical observations in patients with RTHα, our studies of TRα1 + m mutant mice at thermoneutrality (30 °C), where animals are not cold-stressed, and, as in humans, heart rate is predominantly controlled by parasympathetic activity, challenge both these assumptions.

It is recognized that TH acts indirectly, affecting efferent SNS output from the central nervous system via TRα1, to regulate metabolic activity in tissues like liver and brown adipose tissue - often in synergy with the direct peripheral actions of the hormone. Our observations suggest that this does not seem to be the case for heart rate, as we did not observe altered SNS activity in TRα1 mutant mice at thermoneutrality (30 °C) or following central, i.c.v. administration of T3. Furthermore, norepinephrine turnover, a marker of SNS activity in the heart, was not altered in T3-treated animals. Our findings are in good agreement with a previous study showing that the T3-induced tachycardia persisted in mice lacking all β-adrenergic receptors, and even earlier work showing no change in β-adrenergic responses in hyper- or hypothyroidism presumably due to intracardiac compensatory mechanisms. However, it is important to note that several previous studies in mice were conducted at room temperature (22 °C), with expression regulation of some genes by TH, including Adrb1, differing in this context. Coupled with the fact that the SNS is more active in mice at 22 °C, such complexities in the interplay between indirect SNS and direct cardiac actions of TH, may have led to an overestimation of the SNS contribution to specific phenotypes in animals studied at temperatures below thermoneutrality.

### 3-iodothyronamine is an endogenous and rapid-acting derivative of thyroid hormone [^1179G3Lb]. Nature Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Thyroxine (T(4)) is the predominant form of thyroid hormone (TH). Hyperthyroidism, a condition associated with excess TH, is characterized by increases in metabolic rate, core body temperature and cardiac performance. In target tissues, T(4) is enzymatically deiodinated to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), a high-affinity ligand for the nuclear TH receptors TR alpha and TR beta, whose activation controls normal vertebrate development and physiology. T(3)-modulated transcription of target genes via activation of TR alpha and TR beta is a slow process, the effects of which manifest over hours and days. Although rapidly occurring effects of TH have been documented, the molecules that mediate these non-genomic effects remain obscure. Here we report the discovery of 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM), a naturally occurring derivative of TH that in vitro is a potent agonist of the G protein-coupled trace amine receptor TAR1. Administering T(1)AM in vivo induces profound hypothermia and bradycardia within minutes. T(1)AM treatment also rapidly reduces cardiac output in an ex vivo working heart preparation. These results suggest the existence of a new signaling pathway, stimulation of which leads to rapid physiological and behavioral consequences that are opposite those associated with excess TH.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^113C7Ax4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^116n8gVn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is vital to initiate the treatment of TS as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. The first-line therapy is administration of antithyroid medications to reduce the synthesis and release of thyroid hormone. Adrenergic blockade with β-blockers to block the peripheral effects of circulating thyroid hormone is paramount in the case of surgery, because severe tachycardia can cause myocardial ischemia or heart failure. Nonselective β-adrenergic antagonism propranolol is the most commonly used β-blocker in TS due to its ability to decrease the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. A shorter acting β -blocker such as esmolol can also be chosen for a more rapid effect. Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may be another choice in patients with TS-induced severe sinus tachycardia which warrant further investigation. High-dose steroid treatment was recommended, but caution is warranted because of a higher infection risk. It is thus not a reasonable choice in an arthroplasty surgery like our case. In refractory cases of TS when conventional treatments are not successful or appropriate, therapeutic plasma exchange might be effective in rapidly reducing thyroid hormone levels with clinical improvement. Besides, some supportive and resuscitative measures such as eliminating predisposing factors, correcting fluid losses, and relieving hyperthermia should be promptly initiated. Salicylates like aspirin should be avoided due to its binding to T4-binding globulin. Resultant increased free hormone levels will exacerbate TS. The diagnosis of TS was not initially considered due to insufficient knowledge of thyroid disease of the patient preoperatively. However, our patient did not progress into a critical condition, which might be attributed to a moderate-high basal metabolic rate upon hospitalization (103 + 60–111 = 52), noninfectious surgery, no severe comorbidity, a guaranteed depth of anesthesia from a closed-loop system for propofol administration, and prompt treatment.

Non-thyroid surgery could be an independent predisposing factor for thyroid storm in patients with hyperthyroidism. The importance of careful preoperative history taking cannot be overestimated. Any abnormalities during an operation like abnormal heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, or even the unusual anesthetics used, should not be ignored. In surgeries with general anesthesia, it is necessary to be cautious about TS with an atypical manifestation of tachycardia. Once suspected, supportive and antithyroid medication should be promptly initiated.

### Encephalopathy and sinustachycardia in childhood – a possible differential diagnosis [^114yUDBs]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

We report on a 7-year-old girl with generalized seizures, somnolence, fever, and respiratory distress. The increase of sinus tachycardia with good hydration, sufficient analgesia, and hyperthermia in our patient led to the determination of thyroid hormones, and therefore finally to the diagnosis of a thyrotoxic crisis in Graves' disease. Thyrotoxic crisis is a very rare but severe disease with an incidence of 0.1/100,000–3/100,000 among children. Important differential diagnoses of hyperthyroidism are Hashimoto thyroiditis, paraneoplastic thyroid-stimulating hormone production, thyroid autonomy, as well as central hyperthyroidism. Although symptoms disappear by thyrostatic therapy (thiamazole, carbimazole, dexamethasone), a euthyroid status could only be achieved by thyroidectomy. Thyrotoxic crisis should be considered a differential diagnosis in case of resistant unexplained sinus tachycardia, seizures, and encephalopathy. Immediate and adequate therapy contributes significantly to a reduction in the high morbidity and mortality rates. A combination of several treatment approaches for hyperthyroidism can lead to a successful outcome.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^115KS75i]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid hormones (THs) exert profound chronotropic and inotropic cardiovascular effects, manifesting as bradycardia in hypothyroidism whilst tachycardia is a leading symptom of hyperthyroidism. The actions of THs are mediated by their nuclear TH receptors, TRα1 and TRβ, which are encoded by the two different genes THRA and THRB. In the heart, TRα1 is the predominant isoform and mediates the known effects of the hormone such as increasing contractility, oxygen consumption, cardiac output as well as heart rate –. Several bona fide target genes of TH action in the heart have been identified, including the pacemaker channels HCN2 and HCN4 (Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated Channel 2 and 4), which conduct the "funny current" in the sinoatrial node that generates slow diastolic depolarization to the threshold, initiating a propagated action potential spreading through the entire heart. Additionally, the voltage-gated potassium channels KCNA5 and KCND2 that contribute to the early repolarization of cardiomyocytes as well as the calcium flux modulating proteins ATP2A2 (SERCA2) and RYR2 are also known targets of TH. In addition to the direct actions on peripheral tissues, TH can also act centrally in the brain, altering the output of the autonomic nervous system to liver or brown adipose tissue. Although this paradigm of acute central action of TH has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for the cardiovascular system, it is widely assumed that hyperthyroidism reduces the vagal tone of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) while activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Together with proposed increases in activity of the adrenergic receptor ADRB1 and the pacemaker channels HCN2 and HCN4, these mechanisms are currently assumed to mediate the tachycardia of thyrotoxicosis.

### Notes for the general paediatrician: managing thyrotoxicosis in children and young people [^117KHtcK]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism, or excess thyroid hormone production, causing signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, is a rare but serious disorder in children and young people. Biochemically, the hallmarks of hyperthyroidism are an excess of circulating free thyroxine (fT4) and triiodothyronine (fT3) secreted from the thyroid gland and a suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The most common cause is Graves' disease, resulting from TSH receptor stimulation by autoantibodies. Thyrotoxicosis can occur at any age, but frequency increases with age and peaks during adolescence, with an incidence of Graves' disease reported as 1 per 100 000 in children under the age of 16 years. Less commonly, thyrotoxicosis could be due to subacute thyroiditis, early Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, autonomous functioning nodules, amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis and activating TSH receptor mutations. More recently, COVID-19 infections have been proposed as triggers with association studies demonstrating an increased frequency of thyrotoxicosis, likely to be a consequence of cytokine fluxes, as reported in adult populations.

Although relatively rare in children, it is important for paediatricians to recognise features early to minimise the risks arising from thyrotoxicosis. In mild cases, attention span and school performance can be affected due to the cognitive and psychosocial impact of excess thyroid hormones. While accelerated growthdoes not usually lead to early puberty and reduced final height, the long-term risk of osteopaenia through suboptimal bone mineralisation remains pertinent. Children often present with irritability, weight loss, excessive sweating and heat intolerance; these features should prompt investigation for thyroid status without delay. It is critical to act early to prevent deterioration into more severe forms of thyrotoxicosis, such as a thyroid storm. This is a medical emergency with potential for life-threatening cardiovascular instability and a high mortality rate, estimated at 10%. In contrast to unhindered thyrotoxicosis, overtreatment, resulting in hypothyroidism, risks deceleration in growth and impaired quality of life. Thus, treatment of thyrotoxicosis in childhood is finely balanced and requires a deep understanding of the diagnostic principles and complex short-term and long-term risks.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1149umNk]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — etiology, complications, and defining laboratory pattern are outlined, noting that overt thyrotoxicosis is characterized by excess thyroid hormones in serum and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (< 0.01 mU/L). Painless thyroiditis accounts for about 10% of hyperthyroid cases and occurs in 5–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, while remission of GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Complications of untreated thyrotoxicosis include loss of weight, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and even cardiovascular collapse and death, and symptoms such as tachycardia and anxiety appear more pronounced in younger patients and those with larger goiters.

### Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders [^117NzRB4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders:

- **Definition**: Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran, is a potent antiarrhythmic medication that can alter thyroid hormone metabolism and may precipitate hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders are caused by either deiodination, which releases large amounts of iodine that can impair thyroid function, or by direct cytotoxicity on thyroid cells by amiodarone or its metabolite.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients taking amiodarone ranges from 5% to 14%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders include high cumulative doses of amiodarone, longer duration of treatment, a higher baseline TSH level, older age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), pre-existing thyroid disease (autonomous thyroid nodules or latent Graves' disease).
- **Disease course**: Amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is similar to iodine-induced hypothyroidism and typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. It can also lead to myxedema coma, severe bradycardia, prolonged atrioventricular conduction, peripheral edema, and severe muscle cramps. On the other hand, amiodarone-associated hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, presents with symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, muscle weakness, anorexia, restlessness, tremor, and congestive HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders is generally favorable. Most patients can recover thyroid function once amiodarone is stopped, but some may require long-term management due to persistent thyroid dysfunction.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^114drWPY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Irreversibly altered expression of T3-regulated genes governing cardiomyocyte action potential in TRα1 + m mice

To investigate the molecular basis for resistance to T3-induced tachycardia, we undertook microarray profiling of gene expression in hearts of wild-type and TRα1 + m mice, acclimated at 30 °C, before and after T3 treatment. Principal component analysis showed distinct clustering of the four different groups (Fig. 3a). Whilst 240 genes were T3-regulated in wild-type animals, 161 genes were differentially expressed between wild-type and TRα1 + m mice and 345 genes being differentially expressed between wild-type or TRα1 + m mice after receptor reactivation by T3 (Fig. 3 b). Cardiac target genes, known to be T3-regulated in mice at room temperature, were also downregulated (Myh7) or induced (Ryr2) at 30 °C (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3A). In addition, basal expression of genes (Myh6, Ryr2, Atp2a2) was lower or higher (Myh7, Adrb1) in TRα1 + m mice, with Chrm2 expression being unchanged (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3A). Contrary to expectations, T3 treatment did not affect Adrb1 expression at 30 °C (Supplementary Fig. 3A), suggesting that upregulation of this receptor is unlikely to account for the known increased cardiac sympathetic hypersensitivity of hyperthyroidism. As expected, expression of the pacemaker gene Hcn4 was downregulated in untreated TRα1 + m mice, with both Hcn2 and Hcn4 being strongly T3-induced in both genotypes, showing that T3 treatment of TRα1 + m mice reactivates normal TRα1 signalling in the heart (Fig. 3 c). Unbiased gene ontology pathway analyses revealed several T3-regulated pathways affected by T3 including factors involved in metabolic and immune processes and regulation of heart rate (Supplementary Fig. 3B, top ten genes for each factor in Supplementary Fig. 3C). Accordingly, we then focussed on genes involved in the regulation of heart rate (GO:0002027 plus potassium channels), revealing several T3-regulated bona fide TRα1 target genes (Fig. 3d) as well as genes that were regulated by T3 without a TRα1 contribution (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Most importantly, we identified several genes whose expression was irreversibly altered in TRα1 + m mice (Fig. 3e), including potassium channel genes such as Kcnh2 as well as the calcium channel Ryr2, providing a possible molecular explanation for cardiac T3 resistance in these animals.

Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia;

Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness;

Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest;

Respiratory: dyspnea;

Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and elevation in liver function tests;

Dermatologic: hair loss; flushing;

Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density;

Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility.

Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised height.

Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.

Inadequate levothyroxine dosage will produce or fail to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various Gl symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^112D3Wmj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our case indicates that a comprehensive preoperative history collection is extremely crucial for underdiagnosed patients, especially for elective surgery. Thyroid diseases can be discovered with a more careful preoperative assessment and TS probably prevented. In reported cases listed in Tables 3, 61% (11/18) patients experienced TS due to unrecognized underlying hyperthyroidism preoperatively. The signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be very subtle to clinically overt. Patients with hyperthyroidism commonly experience palpitations, fatigue, tremor, anxiety, disturbed sleep, weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating, tachycardia, and fever. Thyroid nodules or a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes with a bruit, may be palpable. Up to 25% of patients with Graves' disease present with signs of ophthalmopathy. Other rare extrathyroidal Graves' disease manifestations include pretibial myxedema and acropachy. When patients present with multiple symptoms and signs as mentioned above, hyperthyroidism should be considered as a potential diagnosis. Symptoms that are often overlooked include abdominal discomfort, weight changes, and fatigue. Of note, some non-thyroid diseases and drugs can influence thyroid hormone levels, including gestational trophoblastic disease, McCune-Albright syndrome, teratoma (struma ovarii), TSH-producing pituitary adenomas, and amiodarone. Patients with these diseases have an increased likelihood to develop hyperthyroidism and TS.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^111XfTGH]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The human disorder of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone α (RTHα), or congenital, nongoitrous hypothyroidism 6 (OMIM 614450), due to heterozygous mutations in TRα1, is characterized by refractoriness to TH action in TRα1-expressing tissues (e.g. central nervous system, bone, myocardium, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract). Thyroxine therapy of RTHα is beneficial, improving linear growth, increasing resting energy expenditure to limit weight gain, alleviating constipation and enhancing wellbeing and affect of patients –. However, as treatment with high dosages of thyroxine is required to overcome tissue hormone resistance, this therapeutic approach could potentially be associated with thyrotoxic side effects including in the cardiovascular system.

In this work, we unexpectedly find that high dose thyroxine therapy of RTHα patients with a partial loss-of-function mutation (A263V) in TRαdoes not elevate their heart rate. Investigating underlying mechanisms mediating this, we studied the cardiac phenotype in mice harboring a TRα1R384C mutation, which exhibits similar, partial, loss-of-function. Using these mice, we find that the effects of TH on heart rate are largely direct, whilst its effects via the autonomic nervous system predominantly affect heart rate frequency distribution rather than average heart rate. Combining cardiac telemetry and microarray-based transcriptomics, we demonstrate that the TH mediated upregulation of Hcn2 and Hcn4 expression is not associated with changes in heart rate. Furthermore, we find that impaired TRα1 action during mouse development programs irreversible changes in expression of multiple cardiac genes, including potassium and calcium channels. We suggest that such developmental programming by altered epigenetic DNA methylation accounts for the observed lack of elevation in heart rate following treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine in high dosage.

Symptomatic management of thyrotoxicosis — beta-adrenergic blockade is recommended in all patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, especially elderly patients and thyrotoxic patients with resting heart rates in excess of 90 beats per minute or coexistent cardiovascular disease, with a strong recommendation and moderate-quality evidence. In a randomized controlled trial of MMI alone versus MMI plus a β-adrenergic blocking agent, after 4 weeks patients taking β-adrenergic blockers had lower heart rates, less shortness of breath and fatigue, and improved "physical functioning" on the SF-36 health questionnaire. Technical remarks state that β-blockers should be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic asthma; in quiescent bronchospastic asthma or mild obstructive airway disease or symptomatic Raynaud's phenomenon a relative β1-selective agent can be used cautiously with careful monitoring of pulmonary status, very high doses may occasionally be required to reduce heart rate to near the upper limit of normal but low to moderate doses often give sufficient symptom relief, and oral verapamil or diltiazem have been shown to affect rate control when patients do not tolerate or are not candidates for β-adrenergic blocking agents.

A previously well, 4-year-old girl presented with a 4–6 weeks' history of increased appetite, weight loss, tiredness, sleep difficulty, excessive sweating, swelling in the neck and new-onset 'prominent, protruding eyes'. Family history revealed paternal grandmother receiving treatment for hyperthyroidism. Clinical assessment demonstrated features of thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, warm peripheries, small smooth goitre with no nodules, exophthalmos). TFT (Free T4 = 101pmol/L, thyroid-stimulating hormone < 0.05mIU/L) with raised thyroid peroxidase antibody levels (TPO = 541IU/mL) confirmed autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Observation on the ward showed features of thyrotoxic crisis with persistent severe tachycardia on ECG (sinus tachycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)) and hypertension. Ultrasound thyroid showed diffuse thyroiditis with no focal lesion. Echocardiogram confirmed the above findings. A diagnosis of Graves' disease with thyrotoxic crisis was made. Antithyroid treatment (carbimazole) and beta-blocker (propranolol) was commenced. Thyrotoxic crisis resolved over 2 weeks and the child has continued to respond to carbimazole treatment at 1-year follow-up.

In contrast to the SNS, we observed a slight reduction in PSNS activity following T3 administration at 30 °C in both genotypes, reflecting lower vagal activity in hyperthyroidism as reported previously. Although reduced PSNS activity should result in elevation of heart rate, this was not observed in TRα1 + m mice suggesting that the hearts of these animals are less sensitive to altered PSNS activity. Furthermore, in denervation studies, TRα1 + m mice exhibited lower overall PSNS input — also a characteristic seen in hypothyroid patients. Nevertheless, our observation that no change in SNS or PSNS activity was seen following i.c.v administration of T3 in wild-type mice, suggests that the interaction between TH and the PSNS control of heart rate may be largely mediated at the level of cardiac signal transduction. Overall, our data suggest that the acute central autonomic effects of TH on average heart rate may be negligible, whilst T3 may still influence other cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate frequency distribution, as observed in an animal model of central hypothyroidism.

It has long been recognized that TH positively regulates expression of sinoatrial pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4, providing a potential molecular mechanism for the chronotropic effects of the hormone. However, our observations in T3-treated TRα1 + m mice at 30 °C, dissociate changes in expression of these genes from heart rate: whilst Hcn2 and Hcn4 expression was strongly induced as expected, the animals remained bradycardic with no change in heart rate following T3 administration, indicating that neither Hcn2 nor Hcn4 were determinants of this. Our observations are supported by recent animal studies, showing that Hcn2 knockout mice exhibit normal heart rate. Likewise, many inducible, cardiac-specific Hcn4 knockout models also showed normal heart rate, although these findings are somewhat controversial. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that rather than controlling pacemaker activity, these Hcn channels function to stabilize heart rate and integrate autonomic signals, with increased sensitivity to PSNS activity seen in an inducible Hcn4 knockout model supporting this notion. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the observed T3 effects on Hcn2 and/or Hcn4 expression rather mediate altered PSNS responses seen in hyperthyroid animals.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^111StMSG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroid crisis often occurs in patients with untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism. There are many well-described risk factors that can induce TS such as irregular use or discontinuation of antithyroid drugs, thyroidal or nonthyroidal surgery, major trauma, infection, emotional stress, parturition, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary thromboembolism, etc. Still, about one third patients don't have a clearly identifiable precipitating factor.

The preliminary diagnosis of TS should be made entirely on the basis of nonspecific clinical findings, namely dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, thermoregulatory system, gastrointestinal-hepatic system, and central nervous system. Thyroid hormone plays an important role in regulating the HR, cardiac contractility, myocardial oxygen consumption, and systemic vascular resistance. Patients with hyperthyroidism can presented as palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or even heart failure if progress into TS. The central nervous system manifestations can range from agitation, delirium, and confusion to coma. Hyperthyroidism or TS related gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, severe diarrhea, or abdominal pain might be attributed to various pathogenetic mechanisms, including visceral nociception triggered by thyrotoxicosis-induced hypermotility with mechanical stretch, and "mesenteric ischemia from sympathetic hypersensitivity with resultant release of pro-inflammatory pain-mediating cytokines acting on gut mucosal receptors". Studies revealed that 30% of hyperthyroidism patients may develop liver dysfunction. The underlying mechanism may be due to hepatic congestion, hypoperfusion, or toxic effect from thyroxine to liver cells causing apoptosis of liver cells. TS developing into jaundice probably indicates a poor prognosis. Given the nonspecific nature, TS has been misdiagnosed as acute abdomen, status epilepticus, rhabdomyolysis, lactic acidosis, or other emergent situations in some case reports.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^111Q7npZ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

Observations

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered.

### The role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and metabolic syndrome [^1169Goad]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

THs, especially T3 produced by enzymatic reaction catalyzed by type 1 (D1) or type 2 5′deiodinases (D2), are enrolled in controlling metabolic rate by several mechanisms, as explained in the following sections of this manuscript. In summary, they exert direct effects on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilization, uncoupling synthesis of ATP, mitochondrial biogenesis and have inotropic and chronotropic effects on body. THs also act controlling core body temperature, appetite, and sympathetic activity. Additionally to T4 and T3, other TH metabolites exert similar effects. It has been demonstrated that 3,5 diiodo-L-thyronine (T2) prevents high-fat-diet-induced adiposity by means of increasing EE and promoting anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic pathways in white adipose tissue (WAT). Also, studies have demonstrated that decarboxylated TH molecules, termed thyronamines, when given to animals, lead to metabolic effects that generally oppose the direction of T3. Thyronamines are primarily produced in the thyroid, but there is evidence that they may be produced in other tissues. – The physiological and clinical relevance of TH metabolites is under intense investigation. –

The thermogenic effects of TH, especially T3, are well known, and hyperthyroid patients have an increase in heat production and are heat intolerant. Hyperthyroid patients are opposite to hypothyroid patients, who produce less heat and are cold intolerant. After thyroid hormone administration there is an increase in oxygen consumption in most tissues.THs cause a direct increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilization leading to acceleration of anabolic and catabolic pathways in the macronutrient metabolism, such as lipolysis/fatty-acid oxidation and increased protein turnover. In addition, THs stimulate the sodium/potassium (Na + /K +) ATPase and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) that mediate ion transport through membranes, processes that require ATP utilization, leading to increasing of it consumption and contributing to thermogenesis. Therefore, thyroid hormone increased the utilization of energy reserves, such as lipids from the adipose tissue.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^115i3kPB]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Studies of TRα1 knockout mice, which exhibit bradycardia, underscore the important role of this receptor isoform in controlling heart rate. Subsequently, insights into the interplay between central and peripheral actions of TH were gained using mice heterozygous for the R384C mutation in TRα1 (TRα1 + m), which better resembles the situation found in the respective patients. This unique animal model has the particular advantage that this mutation only partially reduces 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) binding to the receptor, such that it inhibits the function of its wild-type counterpart in a dominant negative manner in the presence of physiological TH concentrations; however, treating these mice with T3 in pharmacological dosage reactivates TRα1 signalling fully in vivo. Accordingly, TRα1 + m mice enable differentiation of the acute versus permanent effects of defective, mutant TRα1 during mouse development.

### Thyroid-adrenergic interactions: physiological and clinical implications [^111A8ikF]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

The sympathoadrenal system, including the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla, interacts with thyroid hormone (TH) at various levels. Both systems are evolutionary old and regulate independent functions, playing probably independent roles in poikilothermic species. With the advent of homeothermy, TH acquired a new role, which is to stimulate thermogenic mechanisms and synergize with the sympathoadrenal system to produce heat and maintain body temperature. An important part of this new function is mediated through coordinated and, most of the time, synergistic interactions with the sympathoadrenal system. Catecholamines can in turn activate TH in a tissue-specific manner, most notably in brown adipose tissue. Such interactions are of great adaptive value in cold adaptation and in states needing high-energy output. Conversely, in states of emergency where energy demand should be reduced, such as disease and starvation, both systems are turned down. In pathological states, where one of the systems is fixed at a high or a low level, coordination is lost with disruption of the physiology and development of symptoms. Exaggerated responses to catecholamines dominate the manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, while hypothyroidism is characterized by a narrowing of adaptive responses (e.g., thermogenic, cardiovascular, and lipolytic). Finally, emerging results suggest the possibility that disrupted interactions between the two systems contribute to explain metabolic variability, for example, fuel efficiency, energy expenditure, and lipolytic responses.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111XB5Nn]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — hemodynamics and heart failure: Hyperthyroidism produces decreased systemic vascular resistance, increased resting heart rate and left ventricular (LV) contractility, and enhanced isovolumic ventricular relaxation, with circulating blood volume that can increase up to 25% and a cardiac output that is increased by up to 300% from a euthyroid state. Pulmonary artery hypertension is increasingly recognized in hyperthyroidism and may increase load on the right ventricle (RV), leading to RV dilatation and a rise in right atrial and central venous pressures. Occasionally, severe, long-standing hyperthyroidism has poor cardiac contractility, low cardiac output, and symptoms and signs of heart failure (HF), most often with persistent sinus tachycardia or rapid ventricular rates from atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter causing rate-related or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Prompt recognition and effective management in patients > 50 years of age are important because cardiovascular complications are the chief cause of death after treatment of hyperthyroidism.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of LEVOTHROID®:

Notify your physician if you are allergic to any foods or medicines, are pregnant or intend to become pregnant, are breast-feeding or are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations.
Notify your physician of any other medical conditions you may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems. Your dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while you are taking LEVOTHROID®. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by your physician and immediately report any changes to your physician. If you are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), your clotting status should be checked frequently.
Use LEVOTHROID®only as prescribed by your physician. Do not discontinue or change the amount you take or how often you take it, unless directed to do so by your physician.
The levothyroxine in LEVOTHROID®is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by your thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life, except in cases of transient hypothyroidism, which is usually associated with an inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis).
Take LEVOTHROID®as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Levothyroxine absorption is increased on an empty stomach.
It may take several weeks before you notice an improvement in your symptoms.
Notify your physician if you experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.
Notify your physician if you become pregnant while taking LEVOTHROID®. It is likely that your dose of LEVOTHROID®will need to be increased while you are pregnant.
Notify your physician or dentist that you are taking LEVOTHROID®prior to any surgery.
Partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of LEVOTHROID®therapy, but this is usually temporary.
LEVOTHROID®should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.
Keep LEVOTHROID®out of the reach of children. Store LEVOTHROID®away from heat, moisture, and light.
Agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine sodium tablets. Therefore, levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be administered within 4 hrs of these agents.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone β in autoimmune thyroid disease: a case report and review of literature [^111vbr3G]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old female presented with heat intolerance, palpitations, weight gain, and goiter. Thyroid function tests showed FT4 at 24.46 pmol/L (normal range, 9.01–19.05), FT3 at 7.31 pmol/L (normal range, 2.63–5.70), and TSH at 8.63 mIU/L (normal range, 0.35–4.94). Radioiodine uptake was 21.95% at 3 h (normal range, 10–30%) and 41.5% at 24 h (normal range, 25–60%). TSH was stimulated from 4.50 to 34.40 mIU/L 15 min after intravenous bolus of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH); liothyronine (L-T3) suppressed TSH from 4.61 mIU/L to 0.21 mIU/L. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormality. Gene sequencing identified a heterozygous Y321C substitution mutation in exon 9 of the THRB gene, thereby confirming the diagnosis of RTHβ. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan revealed decreased bone mass. The patient was considered as susceptible to Hashimoto's thyroiditis based on positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), positive thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), and negative thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb). She was given L-T3 to suppress TSH, and a β-blocker to manage tachycardia.

### Thyroid disorders in subfertility and early pregnancy [^116icx6p]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

HG often presents in the first trimester of pregnancy with severe nausea and vomiting. It may result in dehydration and ketonuria. Thyroid biochemistry will begin to normalise to trimester specific reference range; initially with FT4 resolving with the cessation of vomiting however the TSH can often remain suppressed for several weeks. Differentiating this from the autoimmune condition of Graves' disease is important and there can often be a goitre, thyroid eye disease (Graves' orbitopathy) or TRAbs in the latter. Yoshihara et al. suggested that using a free T3/free T4 ratio could be discriminatory, as patients with gestational thyrotoxicosis have significantly lower T3 values, frequently in the normal range.

Graves' disease has a prevalence in pregnancy of 0.4% and can either be detected prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy or postpartum (e.g. detected due to the infant having thyroid disturbance). If diagnosed prior to conception it is treated with anti-thyroid medications, thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment. The symptoms of thyrotoxicosis can often be taken for expected pregnancy-related effects (shortness of breath on exertion, mild tachycardia, and heat intolerance). Patients should be examined for thyroid eye signs as these can often worsen in the first trimester. Unlike hypothyroidism, where there is often an increased requirement of treatment as pregnancy progresses, with Graves' disease there is often a reduction in the amount of medication required with each trimester, which may be related to the immunological changes in pregnancy. It is important to remain vigilant of symptoms in the postpartum period as thyroiditis can often exacerbate disease activity.

### The role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and metabolic syndrome [^117BvHF7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms by which thyroid function may interact with components of metabolic syndrome

TH may be involved in each one of the four major components of MetS via several mechanisms. This involvement is not necessarily unidirectional, since target tissues of TH may also be involved with thyroid function. TH actions lead to specific effects that influence endpoints regarding body adiposity, glucose or lipid levels, and BP.– In this way, all four features of MetS may be influenced by TH levels as separately described in specific following sections.

In summary, adiposity may be the consequence of the role of THs (or its metabolites) on the regulation of metabolic rate, appetite control or even sympathetic activity. This sympathetic stimulus by THs also influences glucose and lipid metabolism as it impacts cardiovascular system regulation.– Hyperglycemia may be the consequence of reduced glucose uptake in hypothyroidism or the consequence of increased glucose liver production in hyperthyroidism. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin degradation are also regulated by THs. Dyslipidemia may be related to thyroid function, since THs also act stimulating both lipid synthesis and degradation. Finally, high BP (HBP) may be the consequence of TH action on the vasculature and in the heart by TR-mediated gene regulation at the nucleus or via other non-classical pathways at the cytoplasmatic and cellular membrane levels.

However, it is notable that the augmentation in adiposity, especially central adiposity, which is one of the hallmarks of MetS, appears to generate an increase in several hormones, cytokines, and other compounds that influence thyroid function via different pathways. The proposed mechanisms involved in these actions will be summarized in the next sections.

Thyroid hormones influencing adiposity

Adiposity gain or loss depends primarily on the balance between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). Resting EE (REE) is solely used in the cellular process to maintain life.EE can be stimulated by physical activity or acceleration of different metabolic processes, resulting in heat production (facultative thermogenesis). The balance between EE and EI depends mainly on satiety control, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and the endocrine system. THs are strong regulators of the metabolic rate with consequent effects on different outcomes, including adiposity. However, as previously described, the relationship between TH and adiposity is bidirectional, since TH and also thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have effects on adiposity, which in turn may act on thyroid function and perhaps on the structure of this gland. Adiposity leads to production of several hormones, cytokines, and other compounds that influence thyroid function, as described in the next sections.

### Heart failure as a serious complication of iodinated contrast-induced hyperthyroidism: case-report [^114YaKxt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In retrospect, the hyperthyroidism was most likely provoked by administration of ICM during the initial chest CT and contributed to the sustained tachycardia.

In people with normal thyroids, large iodine load results in decreased synthesis of T4 and T3 due to reduced organification, halting the production of thyroid hormone. This is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. However, in patients with underlying thyroid disease such as multinodular goitre or Graves' disease, this auto-regulatory process can be impaired. Although the effect of ICM on the thyroid gland is not precisely known, exposure to an excess amount of iodine can cause hypersecretion of thyroid hormones, which is known as the Jod-Basedow phenomenon.

The prevalence of hyperthyroidism after ICM has been previously studied and the number needed to harm is as few as twenty-three. Suppressed TSH levels in 6.9% of patients four weeks after coronary angiography have been reported. In patients with cardiac ischemia 7.2% of patients have hyperthyroidism at baseline, which increases to 10% after administration of ICM. Risk factors associated with ICM induced hyperthyroidism are the presence of thyroid nodules, age over 60, male gender and a family history of thyroid disease. Interestingly 4.2% of patients still shows hyperthyroidism after three months, indicating ICM induced hyperthyroidism persists for a longer period. Although hyperthyroidism after ICM is quite common, literature regarding severity of disease and the prevalence of serious adverse events is sparse and limited to case studies. Screening strategies and the use of prophylactic measures have been investigated. Thyroid scintigraphy with Tc-99 m has been used for risk stratification. Tc-99 m thyroid uptake has been used as a measure for the amount and function of autonomous tissue in case of TSH suppression. Patients with a Tc-99 m uptake greater than 1% have received prophylactic treatment with perchlorate and thiamozole before undergoing coronary angiography. Although effective, insight in the cost-effectiveness of such an intervention currently lacks and logistics can be challenging in emergency situations. Preventive interventions for all patients are not supported by current guidelines. Also routine TSH monitoring following ICM administration is not recommended. On the other hand, guidelines do recommend monitoring of high-risk patients after receiving ICM in order to initiate therapy if necessary. It is also stated that it is important for clinicians to mention a patient's history of thyroid disease when ordering radiology examinations.

### Resting energy expenditure and cold-induced thermogenesis in patients with overt hyperthyroidism [^1116oZmk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The elevated core body temperature is a hallmark of hyperthyroidism which has been induced by highly supraphysiologic doses of TH in animals. In humans suffering from hyperthyroidism, elevated core body temperature is rare, occurring mainly in the setting of concomitant disease. Hence, we did not observe elevated core body temperatures in the hyperthyroid compared with the euthyroid state. However, this does not preclude an increase of core body temperature above 37°C if the ambient temperature is considerably higher than the temperature in our study environment. Skin temperatures in the warm state were significantly higher during hyperthyroidism, indicating increased cutaneous heat loss as a consequence of elevated REE. TH signaling is crucial for the regulation of vascular tone and heat dissipation. Higher levels of TH might thus lead to improved insulating response to cold exposure and minimize the need for CIT. However, after mild cold exposure skin temperatures did not differ between the hyperthyroid and the euthyroid state, suggesting that the vasoconstrictory reactions to cold were comparable. In this context, it is of note that the subjects' sensation of cold was not independent of the TH state.

In our study cohort, both fT4 and fT3 had a significant impact on REE. As elevated levels of fT4 and fT3 had such a pronounced influence on REE, we analyzed its effect on CIT. Indeed, the level of REE was inversely and significantly associated with CIT, demonstrating that higher levels of REE reduce the body's need to increase EE in response to cold. This relation was especially apparent in the hyperthyroid state thus reiterating earlier findings from rodents: BAT activity in response to cold was blunted in thyroidectomized, hypothyroid rats and could be restored by replacing maintenance doses of TH. However, excessive amounts of TH did not increase BAT activity further. When we statistically corrected for the effect of REE on CIT by using mixed-effects modelling, fT4 and fT3 were positively associated with CIT albeit borderline significant. Taken together these findings indicate that the higher REE which is robustly induced by hyperthyroidism reduces the need for CIT and thus counteracts the permissive effects of TH on BAT thermogenesis.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — for patients unresponsive to aggressive medical therapy with MMI and corticosteroids, patients should undergo thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Patients who fail to respond to medical therapy should be offered thyroidectomy before they become excessively debilitated, and delay or deferral of surgery imparts an even higher risk of death. Thyroidectomy done under regional anesthesia when available may be preferred for very ill patients. In patients in whom amiodarone was stopped during an episode of AIT, definitive therapy with RAI or surgery should be considered to facilitate reintroduction of amiodarone without concerns about recurrent AIT.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^111Z938k]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Whilst RTH due to TRβ mutations has long been recognized, individuals with a mutation in TRα1 were discovered relatively recently, and often exhibit resting bradycardia. Our studies show that such reduction in their resting heart rate together with refractoriness to the expected rise following thyroxine therapy of patients in high dosage, is likely to be due to effects of mutant TRα1 during embryonic development, irreversibly reprogramming cardiac pacemaker function. These observations suggest that thyroxine therapy of RTHα, in dosage sufficient to overcome hormone resistance, can be undertaken without inducing the detrimental tachycardia associated with elevated circulating thyroid hormones. Nevertheless, as several genes (e.g. Kcnh2) that are downregulated in TRα1R384C mutant mice are associated with arrhythmia or sudden death, close monitoring of thyroxine-treated RTHα patients seems advisable.

Overall, our data show that impaired TRα1 signalling during embryonal development leads to cardiac reprogramming which confers resistance to T3-induced tachycardia. At the molecular level, such resistance occurs despite expected upregulation of Hcn2 and Hcn4, indicating that these classical T3 target genes alone are not sufficient to mediate the tachycardia of hyperthyroidism. Reduced expression of other target genes (the Ryr2 calcium channel; the Kcnh2 potassium channel), likely contribute to the resistance to T3-induced tachycardia seen in TRα1 mutant mice. Most importantly, these observations provide a mechanistic understanding for the lack of tachycardia in thyroxine-treated RTHα patients, suggesting that high dose hormone therapy of this disorder may be safer than previously thought.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

### Resting energy expenditure and cold-induced thermogenesis in patients with overt hyperthyroidism [^1129rcdp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a common endocrine disease which, among other symptoms, often leads to weight loss and heat intolerance. Thyroid hormones (THs) are pivotal regulators of human energy expenditure (EE) and weight loss is mainly due to an increased resting energy expenditure (REE). The high levels of TH in hyperthyroidism affect virtually all mammalian cells. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to EE and heat production especially in response to mild cold exposure.

BAT is thermogenic and can directly convert chemical energy stored in lipids and carbohydrates into heat. The tissue is densely innervated and vascularized. Brown adipocytes contain numerous mitochondria and store lipids in small intracellular droplets which can undergo rapid lipolysis upon stimulation by norepinephrine. The resulting fatty acids activate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a unique protein in BAT mitochondria. UCP1 short-circuits the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane thereby dissipating the stored energy as heat. BAT is activated by the sympathetic nervous system in response to mild cold exposure. Its physiological function in humans is to efficiently generate heat in order to maintain a constant core body temperature of approximately 37°C without the need for shivering. The increase in energy expenditure (EE) above baseline levels in response to mild cold exposure is called "cold-induced thermogenesis" (CIT) and is a major function of BAT. However, it should be noted that probably also skeletal muscle and other tissues may contribute to CIT. During the past decade, BAT and CIT have gained the attention of biomedical research as both may constitute attractive targets to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. Early on, it has been recognized that TH is crucial for mitochondriogenesis and adaptation of BAT activity in response to cold exposure. The tissue expresses high levels of deiodinase 2 (DIO2) which converts thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). Importantly, cold exposure via adrenergic stimulation dramatically increases DIO2 expression in BAT. We and others demonstrated previously that CIT and BAT activity are reduced in patients suffering from hypothyroidism and can be restored to normal levels by adequately replacing levothyroxine.

### Approach to the patient: challenging cases of pediatric thyrotoxicosis [^111GqXT6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 4

A 15-year-old girl was evaluated by a pediatrician because of tiredness for several months. She had complaints of hair loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations during exercise and had lost 4 kg bodyweight in 2 months. Family history was negative for autoimmune thyroid disease. An initial biochemical workup showed a low serum TSH (0.01 mU/L; RI 0.5–5.0) and high FT4 (40 pmol/L; RI 12–22). Anti-TPO antibodies and TRAb levels were negative. The girl was referred to our center for further diagnostics and treatment of thyrotoxicosis. At presentation at our outpatient clinic, there was no tachycardia, and, because the complaints were relatively mild, treatment with ATD was not started yet. Biochemical reevaluation of thyroid hormone levels and TRAb levels showed a suppressed TSH (< 0.01 mU/L), a lower FT4 level compared to initial presentation (26.5 pmol/L), a slightly elevated T3 (3.15 nmol/L; RI 1.3–2.7), and negative anti-TPO antibodies and TRAb levels. Measurement of TRAb levels was repeated as it is known that in cases of pediatric GD TRAb levels can be absent at initial presentation but become positive later on. Because FT4 levels lowered spontaneously, a wait-and-see policy was followed. Within 1 week, the FT4 level normalized, and the TSH was not suppressed anymore 6 weeks later. Thyroid function remained normal, and TRAb levels remained negative during follow-up. The probable diagnosis of mild subacute thyroiditis with a thyrotoxic phase was made.

Thyrotoxicosis is a general term for excess circulating and tissue thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes disorders involving a hyperactive thyroid gland (Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma). Diagnosis and determination of the cause rely on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Other types of thyrotoxicosis are monitored and treated with β-blockers to control symptoms given that most of these conditions resolve spontaneously.

### Potential therapeutic applications of thyroid hormone analogs [^1152JMQs]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) has many beneficial effects including enhancing cardiac function, promoting weight loss and reducing serum cholesterol. Excess thyroid hormone is, however, associated with unwanted effects on the heart, bone and skeletal muscle. We therefore need analogs that harness the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone without the untoward effects. Such work is largely based on understanding the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, specifically the crystal structure of the nuclear receptor proteins. In clinical studies, use of naturally occurring thyroid hormone analogs can suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer without producing tachycardia. Many thyromimetic compounds have been tested in animal models and shown to increase total body oxygen consumption, and to lower weight and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels while having minor effects on heart rate. Alternatively, analogs that specifically enhance both systolic and diastolic function are potentially useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition to analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor agonists, several compounds that are thyroid hormone receptor antagonists have been identified and tested. This Review discusses the potential application of thyroid hormone analogs (both agonists and antagonists) in a variety of human disease states.

### 2016 guidelines for the management of thyroid storm from the Japan Thyroid Association and Japan Endocrine Society (first edition) [^115Piq9e]. Endocrine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic Criteria for Thyroid Storm (Japan Thyroid Association)" for thyroid storm, Graves' disease and thyroid disease in pregnancy.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Thyroid Storm calculator, developed by the Japan Thyroid Association, is a clinical tool used to diagnose thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe manifestations of thyrotoxicosis. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of a thyroid storm, such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal/hepatic disturbances.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to stratify patients into categories of 'Definitive', 'Suspected', or 'No thyroid storm', based on the severity and number of clinical and biochemical manifestations. This helps clinicians to promptly identify and manage this critical condition, thereby reducing the associated morbidity and mortality.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it should be noted that the diagnosis of thyroid storm is a clinical one, and this calculator should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment. It may not be applicable in patients with non-thyroidal illnesses that can mimic the symptoms of a thyroid storm.

This tool is designed to assess the likelihood of a thyroid storm based on specific clinical criteria. Users select from a set of six potential symptoms or clinical findings, and the tool applies diagnostic rules to determine the likelihood of a thyroid storm. The output can indicate one of three possibilities: "Definite thyroid storm", "Suspected thyroid storm", or "Criteria for thyroid storm not met".

Here's how it works:

- Inputs: Users can choose from the following six clinical findings:

- Elevated levels of free triiodothyronine or free thyroxine
- Central nervous system manifestations, such as restlessness, delirium, mental aberration/psychosis, somnolence/lethargy, or coma
- Fever, with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or higher
- Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute or higher
- Congestive heart failure, such as pulmonary edema, rales, or cardiogenic shock
- Gastro-hepatic manifestations, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a bilirubin level of 3.0 mg/dL or higher

The computation assesses these inputs against diagnostic criteria:

1. **Definite thyroid storm**:

- Requires elevated hormone levels and central nervous system manifestations, plus at least one of these additional symptoms: fever, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, or gastro-hepatic manifestations.
- Alternatively, having elevated hormone levels with any combination of three other symptoms also indicates a definite thyroid storm.

2. **Suspected thyroid storm**:

- Occurs when elevated hormone levels are present along with any two other symptoms from the list.
- Alternatively, central nervous system manifestations with any additional symptom suggest a suspected storm.
- Another scenario is having elevated hormone levels with any triple combination of symptoms from the list.

If none of these criteria combinations are met, the tool outputs "Criteria for thyroid storm not met".

This method helps clinicians systematically evaluate symptoms for a conclusive diagnosis of thyroid storm, ensuring that significant combinations of criteria are identified and properly interpreted.

### Resting energy expenditure and cold-induced thermogenesis in patients with overt hyperthyroidism [^114XrnVJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The canonical pathway of BAT activation is via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and its main transmitter norepinephrine in response to cold exposure. Thus a cold stimulus is usually necessary to detect and quantify BAT activity in healthy humans. Interestingly, assessment of BAT activity by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism revealed increased BAT activity even in the absence of cold exposure. However, cold-induced BAT activity and CIT in hyperthyroid humans have not been studied yet.

In this prospective cohort study of patients who were treated for hyperthyroidism we therefore aimed to investigate the effect of TH status on CIT. Moreover, we were interested if TH induced changes in energy metabolism corresponded to changes in body weight and composition during the course of the treatment.

### The clinical implications of sunitinib-induced hypothyroidism: a prospective evaluation [^116MCWK9]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Definition of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

The biochemical diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism was determined in accordance with guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Endocrine Society. Subclinical hypothyroidism is considered as serum TSH above the upper limit of normal (ULN = 4.20 mIU l −1 in our laboratory), with FTI within normal limits. Clinical hypothyroidism is defined as low serum FTI together with elevated TSH. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as serum TSH below the lower limit of normal (LLN = 0.27 mIU l −1 in our laboratory), with serum T4 and T3 within normal ranges. Overt hyperthyroidism is considered as low TSH and elevated FTI.

Patients with overt hypothyroidism and those with at least two consecutive TSH measurements > 10 mIU l −1 and symptoms compatible with hypothyroidism (e.g. fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation or weight gain) received thyroid hormone replacement therapy with-thyroxine. Target TSH concentration for replacement intervention was 0.5–2 mIU l −1. All patients with overt hyperthyroidism and symptoms compatible with hyperthyroidism (e.g. anxiety, weakness, tremor, palpitations, heat intolerance, increased perspiration and weight loss, despite a normal or increased appetite and diarrhoea) were treated.

### Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis [^113UTCQf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are hypermetabolic conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis can be difficult because symptoms can mimic many other disease states leading to inaccurate or untimely diagnoses and management. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of thyrotoxicosis, hallmarked by altered sensorium, and, if untreated, is associated with significant mortality. Thyroid storm should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with altered mental status.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^113HQym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperthyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyperthyroidism include increased synthesis of thyroid hormones (e.g. Grave's disease), release of preformed thyroid hormones due to destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g., thyroiditis), and exogenous thyroid hormone intake.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 13,000 per 100,000 population. In Europe, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 800 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Hyperthyroidism leads to a higher incidence of AF and atrial flutter, and, at least partly by that mechanism, a higher risk of cerebral arterial thrombosis. Hyperthyroidism additionally leads to increased bone turnover and a negative bone balance.

### Atrial fibrillation from thyroid storm [^112ba6of]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid storm is an often-discussed but rare presentation to emergency departments (EDs). The clinical presentation of a thyroid storm is the result of a hyperthyroid state that may result in significant morbidity or disability, or even death. Typically, patients are aware of their hyperthyroid condition, and may be able to recognize an episode of thyroid storm. However, the first presentation of hyperthyroidism could, in fact, be from thyrotoxic crisis.

Objectives

To review the presentation of thyroid storm, including tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, agitation, and altered mental status, which can be easily misdiagnosed as drug intoxication.

Case Report

We present the case of an otherwise healthy young adult who was sent to the ED by an outpatient care provider for generalized and vague symptoms of "feeling unwell" that was eventually diagnosed in the ED as thyrotoxic crisis.

Conclusion

We use this case to emphasize that thyrotoxic crisis should be at least considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with this presentation, and to highlight how, even with apparently usual and effective treatments, a patient may still decompensate.

### Report of a rare case of trauma-induced thyroid storm [^114U9ZJP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Thyroid storm is a potentially life-threatening endocrinologic emergency characterized by an exacerbation of a hyperthyroid state. Several inciting factors can instigate the conversion of thyrotoxicosis to thyroid storm; trauma is one such trigger, but it is rare. Patients with thyroid storm can manifest fever, nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal or hepatic dysfunction (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or jaundice), and arrhythmia and other cardiovascular abnormalities. Treatment of thyroid storm is multimodal and is best managed by the endocrinologist and medical intensivist. Initial medical and supportive therapies are directed at stabilizing the patient, correcting the hyperthyroid state, managing the systemic decompensation, and treating the underlying cause. Once this has been achieved, definitive treatment in the form of radioactive ablation or surgery should be undertaken. We describe a case of thyroid storm in a young man that was precipitated by a motor vehicle accident.

1426. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.26581 Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland, located in the front of the neck, produces excess thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism affects approximately 2. 5% of people worldwide and, if untreated, is associated with irregular heart rhythms, heart failure, osteoporosis, pregnancy complications, and an increased risk of death. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to produce and release excess thyroid hormone. Toxic nodular disease, in which thyroid gland nodules produce extra thyroid hormone, is the second most common cause. Some medications and ingestion of excess thyroid hormone medication can also cause hyperthyroidism.

Hyperthyroidism results in increased metabolism, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, diarrhea, intolerance of heat, excessive sweating, irregular menstruation, shortness of breath while lying down, increased neck size, voice changes, unintentional weight loss, and eye bulging. Occasionally, individuals with hyperthyroidism have no or very mild symptoms. Hyperthyroidism is typically diagnosed based on characteristic symptoms and a low level of thyrotropin in the blood. The degree of hyperthyroidism is determined by measuring thyroid prohormone. Graves disease is diagnosed in patients with hyperthyroidism who have thyrotropin receptor antibodies in their blood. For patients with thyroid nodules or unclear causes of hyperthyroidism, imaging can help determine the cause.

Treatment decisions should be made based on the underlying cause and severity of hyperthyroidism, likelihood of remission, pregnancy plans, patient preference, and availability of experienced surgeons. Hyperthyroidism may also be treated with radioactive iodine, which is given in an oral capsule and destroys thyroid cells by radiation. Radioactive iodine cures more than 90% of hyperthyroidism caused by Graves disease or thyroid nodules but may result in underproduction of thyroid hormone. Patients who develop hypothyroidism after radioactive iodine treatment must be prescribed thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

### Hyperthyroidism and the sympathetic nervous system… [^112tC7dd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Does the sympathetic nervous system participate significantly in the hemodynamic changes of hyperthyroidism. The rapid heart rate and increased cardiac output of thyrotoxic patients have suggested to clinicians that the sympathetic nervous system is an important mediator of the effects of excess thyroid hormone. It has been shown experimentally, moreover, that altering sympathetic impulses by means of epidural block can reverse the metabolic and hemodynamic changes induced by thyroid feeding. 1 The study of the relationships of thyroid hormone and the cardiovascular system has been hampered by the fact that conventional adrenergic-blocking drugs such as phentolamine and guanethidine do not effectively prevent beta-adrenergic stimulation of the myocardium.

The availability of the new compound, pronethalol, which appears to be a specific adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist, provided the opportunity for Wilson and associates2 to study the pharmacodynamic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients with hyperthyroidism.

### Hyperthyroidism… [^115T82mQ]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, in front of the trachea and esophagus. The thyroid produces thyroid hormone, which helps regulate many body functions. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid is overactive and produces more thyroid hormone than the body needs. Women are more likely than men to have hyperthyroidism, and it affects younger persons more than elderly persons. This Patient Page is based on one published in the July 6, 2005, issue of JAMA. Causes More than 70% of cases of hyperthyroidism are related to Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body produces antibodies to its own tissues. These antibodies cause the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.

Some persons with Graves disease develop an eye condition called exophthalmos, in which the eyes begin to protrude because of swelling of tissues behind the eye. Smoking cigarettes greatly increases the risk of a more severe eye problem among persons with Graves disease. Other medical problems that can cause hyperthyroidism are toxic nodular goiter, subacute thyroiditis, exposure to iodine in medications or x-ray dyes, and postpartum thyroiditis. Symptoms Weight loss without eating less or exercising more Palpitations or abnormal heart rhythms Heat intolerance and sweating Nervousness Tremors Eyes that appear to protrude Symptoms may be less severe or even absent in older persons with hyperthyroidism.

Diagnosis Your medical history and a physical examination may indicate the possibility of hyperthyroidism. Simple blood tests show the presence of too much thyroid hormone as well as an abnormally low level of the hormone called TSH. A thyroid scan may be performed using an injection or pill containing a small amount of radioactive material. This test looks for areas of abnormal function within the thyroid gland.

### Agitation and heat intolerance in hypothyroidism… [^111uZNb6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Hypothyroidism in the adult has been characterized clinically by cold intolerance, lethargy, constipation, and overall slowing of intellectual and motor activities. Conversely, classic clinical hyperthyroidism has been recognized by heat intolerance, palpitations, hyperkinesis, and emotional lability. A less classic presentation can occur in elderly patients with hyperthyroidism who have been described as "masked" or "apathetic" hyperthyroid patients. 1 The patient described herein became hypothyroid after discontinuation of replacement therapy. Her clinical presentation was noted by symptoms of heat intolerance, agitation, insomnia, and nervous irritability, which improved as she became euthyroid. Report of a Case. — A 64-year-old woman was initially seen complaining of notable intolerance to hot weather, nervousness, emotional irritability, crying spells, and insomnia.

She had been treated intermittently for a thyroid disorder with desiccated thyroid, 130 mg/day, for 30 years. She had finished the thyroid tablets eight weeks earlier while attending her sister's funeral in a. Corman LC. Agitation and Heat Intolerance in Hypothyroidism. Arch Intern Med. 1981; 141: 959–960.
