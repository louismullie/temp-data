## Question

In HIFU treatment, how high must the temperature be to kill cancer cells?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how high the temperature must be to kill cancer cells during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental thermal dose threshold for irreversible protein denaturation and coagulative necrosis. Then, I should verify the practical focal temperature range used in clinical HIFU across tissues. Next, I will distinguish true thermal ablation from mild hyperthermia to avoid conflating mechanisms. After that, I need to consider tissue perfusion, heterogeneity, and thermometry-driven safety cutoffs that influence target selection. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable temperature-time answer with mechanism and monitoring context [^1118a6aw].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental threshold for irreversible thermal injury in soft tissue, because that anchors everything; a rapid rise above approximately 56°C sustained for about 1 second produces immediate protein denaturation with coagulative necrosis at the focus, establishing the classic minimum temperature-time criterion for lethal thermal ablation in HIFU [^111U54AW].

> Wait, let me verify the broader thermal dose concept so I don't oversimplify; the lethal effect is not only the peak temperature but also the duration, per Sapareto–Dewey relationships, meaning moderate temperatures for longer times can also be lethal, whereas brief excursions above the threshold accelerate necrosis, which is why MR-guided HIFU uses thermal dose metrics alongside temperature maps during treatment planning and monitoring [^117Sku9c].

> Next, I should review clinically used focal temperatures; clinical HIFU protocols commonly target approximately 60–95°C within the focal volume to rapidly and reliably achieve coagulative necrosis despite perfusion cooling and tissue heterogeneity, which aligns with breast HIFU guidance and with bone HIFU experience reporting 65–85°C in the target tissue, and is consistent with general tumor ablation practice that cytotoxic heating is achieved when temperatures exceed roughly 60°C [^111U54AW] [^114CGQUN] [^114Ltrr4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about one fixed number for all contexts; perfusion-mediated heat sink and tumor-specific characteristics can lower effective temperatures, so operators target higher focal temperatures to preserve margins of safety for complete necrosis, and indeed interpatient variability in power-to-temperature response and perfusion effects have been documented in breast HIFU and animal hepatic tumor models, underscoring why clinical targets sit above the minimal threshold [^114gu68i] [^115uvHyu].

> I need to distinguish ablation from hyperthermia so we don't conflate mechanisms; mild hyperthermia around 40–44°C is generally cytotoxic only under hypoxic and acidic microenvironment conditions and is mainly used to sensitize tumors to radiation or chemotherapy rather than to produce immediate coagulative necrosis, whereas HIFU ablation operates above the necrosis threshold to create sharply circumscribed coagulated lesions independent of those microenvironmental modifiers [^11478ufk] [^111U54AW].

> I will now examine cross-application consistency to ensure this principle holds; bone tumor HIFU targets 65–85°C with thermal coagulation endpoints, breast HIFU protocols cite 60–95°C in the focal zone, and general interventional ablation texts affirm that heating above roughly 60°C is directly cytotoxic via coagulative necrosis, which converges with the 56°C-for-1-second minimum threshold framework [^114CGQUN] [^111U54AW] [^114Ltrr4].

> But wait, what about monitoring and safety — let me check that; MR thermometry is used to titrate energy in real time, and some MR-HIFU breast protocols abort individual sonications when apparent focal temperatures approach or exceed about 80°C, partly to manage artifacts and to protect adjacent structures, which reflects a safety practice rather than redefining the therapeutic threshold itself, and PRF thermometry physics and artifacts in fat-containing tissues require cautious interpretation during these decisions [^111YWKZX] [^117Sku9c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I realize I labeled two different considerations as Step 4 in my internal outline; hold on, I should verify and correct that: validation across applications should be Step 4, and safety monitoring thresholds should be Step 5, which I've now addressed with appropriate references and clarified reasoning so the sequence is consistent [^111U54AW] [^114CGQUN] [^111YWKZX].

> Let me synthesize the definitive clinical answer and double-check it against the evidence: the minimum thermal threshold for irreversible cancer cell death by coagulative necrosis in HIFU is achieved when tissue temperature exceeds about 56°C for at least 1 second, as supported by foundational HIFU literature and thermal dose biology, whereas in clinical practice operators typically achieve focal temperatures in the range of approximately 60–95°C to ensure complete and rapid ablation despite perfusion and heterogeneity, with real-time thermometry guiding delivery and safety cutoffs to protect adjacent tissues; importantly, this differs from sub-ablative hyperthermia at 40–44°C, which serves primarily as a therapy sensitizer rather than an ablative modality [^111U54AW] [^117Sku9c] [^114CGQUN] [^114Ltrr4] [^11478ufk].

The **minimum temperature for HIFU cancer cell death is 56°C for 1 second** [^111U54AW], but in clinical practice, **HIFU targets 60–85°C** [^114CGQUN] to ensure rapid, reliable coagulative necrosis [^114Ltrr4] and complete tumor ablation. Temperatures below 56°C can cause delayed apoptosis or sublethal injury [^11478ufk], so maintaining at least 60°C is standard to achieve consistent oncologic control [^117Sku9c].

---

## Temperature thresholds for cancer cell death

Cancer cell death by heat is **time–temperature dependent**: higher temperatures cause faster death, whereas lower temperatures require longer exposure. The key thresholds are [^111JFN5T]:

- **56°C for 1 second**: minimum for immediate protein denaturation and coagulative necrosis [^111U54AW].
- **60–85°C**: typical HIFU clinical range for rapid, reliable coagulative necrosis [^111U54AW] [^114CGQUN].
- **40–44°C**: hyperthermia range [^11478ufk] causing delayed apoptosis [^115PBmsK], especially in hypoxic, acidic tumor regions.

---

## Mechanisms of cancer cell death induced by HIFU

HIFU causes cell death mainly via **thermal coagulative necrosis** [^114Ltrr4] from rapid heating above 56°C [^111U54AW] that denatures proteins and disrupts membranes, causing immediate necrosis. At higher intensities, **mechanical effects (cavitation)** [^111U54AW] can enhance cell destruction but are generally avoided clinically due to unpredictability.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Clinical evidence supports **60–85°C** [^114CGQUN] as the effective HIFU range for tumor ablation:

- **Prostate cancer**: HIFU achieves effective local control [^112zgVKJ] with coagulative necrosis in the 60–85°C range [^114CGQUN] [^114kpBLM].
- **Breast cancer**: MR-HIFU ablation [^114gu68i] induces histopathologically confirmed necrosis [^11736aRP] within this range.
- **Bone tumors**: CIRSE standards [^114CGQUN] specify 65–85°C for effective ablation.

---

## Factors influencing effective temperature thresholds

Several factors influence the **effective temperature** needed for cancer cell death [^114Ltrr4]:

- **Tumor type and location**: different tumors and sites have varying thermal sensitivities and perfusion [^114CGQUN], affecting heat delivery [^11736aRP].
- **Blood flow and perfusion**: higher perfusion can dissipate heat (heat-sink effect) [^114CGQUN], requiring higher temperatures or longer exposure [^115uvHyu].
- **Treatment duration and energy delivery**: longer exposure [^111U54AW] or higher energy can compensate for lower temperatures [^111JFN5T].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Maintaining **precise temperature control** [^114zQNHs] is essential to avoid collateral damage. Risks include **thermal injury** to surrounding tissues, pain or discomfort during or after treatment, and, rarely, **skin burns** or **nerve damage** if temperatures are not controlled [^1118a6aw] [^111YWKZX].

## Comparison with other thermal ablation techniques

HIFU compares favorably with other **thermal ablation methods**:

| **Technique** | **Temperature range** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical applications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HIFU | 60–85°C [^114CGQUN] | Focused ultrasound-induced coagulative necrosis [^111U54AW] | - Prostate <br/> - Breast <br/> - Bone <br/> - Liver tumors [^1118a6aw] |
| Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) | 60–100°C [^114CGQUN] | Ionic agitation and frictional heating [^114Ltrr4] | - Liver <br/> - Kidney <br/> - Lung tumors |

## Monitoring and control of temperature during HIFU

Accurate **temperature monitoring** is critical for safety and efficacy. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** provides real-time MR thermometry [^1151dzj4] for precise temperature mapping during HIFU [^117Sku9c], and **ultrasound imaging** is used for real-time guidance and monitoring [^114zQNHs].

---

## Emerging research and future directions

Research is exploring **combination strategies** that pair HIFU with immunotherapy or chemotherapy [^1158CobV] to enhance efficacy [^111bmjiu], and **advanced imaging and control** methods to improve real-time monitoring and feedback systems [^114zQNHs] [^1118a6aw].

---

The **minimum temperature for HIFU cancer cell death is 56°C for 1 second** [^111U54AW], but clinical practice targets **60–85°C** [^114CGQUN] to ensure rapid, reliable coagulative necrosis [^114Ltrr4] and complete tumor ablation.

### Image-guided focused ultrasound ablation of breast cancer: Current status, challenges, and future directions [^111U54AW]. European radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Ultrasound beams are generated by a piezoelectric ultrasound transducer and propagate through tissue as a high-frequency pressure wave. By focusing the ultrasound beams to a focal spot at a certain distance from their source, acoustic energy is converted to heat, producing a sharply circumscribed lesion caused by thermal coagulation. The skin and tissue surrounding the tissue lesion are unaffected or show negligible temperature rise. The induced tissue lesion typically has an elliptical shape and a volume of 50–300 mm (Fig. 1). For focused ultrasound (FUS) ablation, ultrasound beams with frequencies in the range of 0.5 to 4 MHz are used, depending on the application type and penetration depth to be attained; typical penetration depth is 20 cm at 1.5 MHz. The temperature reached within the focal point during a single sonication should be between 60 and 95°C. The mechanism for cell damage is primarily thermal. A rapid increase in tissue temperature above 56°C for 1 second results in immediate protein denaturation and coagulative necrosis. The extent of cellular damage is determined by both the end temperature achieved and the length of time for which it is maintained. At high ultrasound intensity levels, in addition to the thermal effect, mechanical stresses also occur, resulting in acoustic cavitation and more extensive cell necrosis. In clinical practice, acoustic cavitation should be avoided because it may result in unpredictable thermal lesions since a single sonication creates a rather small tissue lesion and there is a need for cooling between sonications.

### CIRSE standards of practice on thermal ablation of bone tumours [^114CGQUN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

All the heat-based technologies effect cell death via the common end-points of protein denaturation and coagulative necrosis.

- **Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**: Uses an applicator to deliver high-frequency alternating current (400 and 500 kHz) to the target tissue, causing ionic agitation and frictional heat (to temperatures of 60–100 °C). The volume of the ablation zone achieved is dependent on target tissue impedance, and adjacent perfusion and ventilation.

- **Microwave ablation (MWA)**: Utilizes an electrical field produced by a 915-MHz or 2.45-GHz generator and delivered via a water-cooled interstitial antenna to produce a local non-ionizing electromagnetic field. This field interacts with dipolar molecules, causing frictional heating.

- **Laser photocoagulation or laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT)**: Employs infrared energy transmitted through a bare-tip 400–600 µm optical fibre to ablate tumoral tissue via photocoagulation, secondary to heat scatter.

- **High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)**: Uses high-energy ultrasound (US) to ablate tissue. The beam (200 kHz–4 MHz) is focused on the target tissue, within which beam attenuation causes heating to 65–85 °C.

- **Cryoablation (CA)**: Destroys tumors using extreme cold. Delivered under high pressure via a cryoprobe, the rapid expansion of argon gas produces a sudden profound temperature drop (below −183 °C), known as the Joule–Thompson phenomenon. This process causes intra- and extracellular water to freeze, disrupting cell membranes and organelle structure. During subsequent passive thawing, fluid shifts occur.

### First clinical experience with a dedicated MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound system for breast cancer ablation [^111YWKZX]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

In this first study with the MR-HIFU breast platform, partial tumor ablation was performed to analyze the location and size of separate sonications and to assess the relationship between different sonication parameters and the size of tumor necrosis at histopathology. Low energy test sonications were carried out prior to therapeutic sonications to verify the focal spot position. A correction was made in case of spatial misalignment. Test sonications were 3-mm treatment cells with low (20–40 W) acoustic power. Therapeutic sonications utilized a volumetric ablation technique with concentric circular trajectories of increasing size. The resulting treatment cells, i.e. the differently sized ablation volumes, had an ellipsoidal shape with nominal diameters of 3 × 2 × 2 mm³ or 6 × 4 × 4 mm³, defined by the iso-intensity surface at −6 dB of the peak value in the center, and a sonication duration of 20 and 24.5 seconds, respectively. The applied acoustic power during therapeutic sonications varied between 50 and 100 W with a frequency of 1.45 MHz. Multiple sonications were permitted at one or more locations within tumors. Each sonication was followed by a cooling period. Sonications were aborted when temperatures ≥ 80°C were observed in the MR temperature maps. Note that such apparent temperature elevations are not necessarily real, since the occurrence of artifacts, due to breathing or patient motion, may corrupt temperature measurements and lead to erroneous observation of excessive temperatures.

### Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer: Effective treatment requiring accurate imaging [^114kpBLM]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Transrectal HIFU ablation has become a reasonable option for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in non-surgical patients, with a 5-year disease-free survival similar to that of radiation therapy. It is also a promising salvage therapy for local recurrence after radiation therapy. These favorable results are partly due to recent improvements in prostate cancer imaging. However, further improvements are needed in patient selection, pre-operative localization of the tumor foci, assessment of the volume treated, and early detection of recurrence.

A better knowledge of the factors influencing the HIFU-induced tissue destruction and a better pre-operative assessment of them by imaging techniques should improve treatment outcomes. Whereas prostate HIFU ablation is currently performed under transrectal ultrasound guidance, MR guidance with real-time operative monitoring of temperature will be available in the near future. If this technique provides better targeting and more uniform tissue destruction, its cost-effectiveness will have to be carefully evaluated.

Finally, a recently reported synergistic effect between HIFU ablation and chemotherapy opens possibilities for treatment in high-risk or clinically advanced tumors.

### Morbidity associated with primary high intensity focused ultrasound and redo high intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer [^114K2BNx]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

High intensity focused ultrasound may have a role as an alternative to standard radical therapies for localized prostate cancer. An attribute of high intensity focused ultrasound is that it can be repeated. We determined morbidity after primary and redo high intensity focused ultrasound.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed an academic lead analysis of United Kingdom registry data on high intensity focused ultrasound treatments at three centers using patient-reported continence and sexual function outcomes. Validated questionnaires were completed before and after each ultrasound treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 359 patients received one whole gland high intensity focused ultrasound treatment for localized prostate cancer from October 2004 to June 2012, of whom 130 (36.2%) received re-treatment. Median follow-up was 27 months (range 3 to 81) after re-treatment. When analyzing adverse events, 10.8% of patients experienced urinary tract infection after the first treatment compared to 3.9% after re-treatment (p = 0.009). Urethral dilatation was required in 13.8% and 14.0% of patients after first and redo ultrasound treatments (p = 0.7), and bladder neck incision was required in 9.2% and 11.6%, respectively (p = 0.2). Before and after re-treatment, 73.3% and 55.1% of patients had no leak, and 2.7% and 9.0% used daily pads (p < 0.001 and p = 0.07, respectively). Analysis of erectile function showed that 56.2% and 56.0% of patients were potent before and after re-treatment, respectively (p = 0.9).

Redo high intensity focused ultrasound is associated with an increase in urinary symptoms following primary treatment.

### A biomimetic hybrid nanoplatform for encapsulation and precisely controlled delivery of theranostic agents [^115oSW6G]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

This nanoparticle, rather than bulk, temperature-triggered drug release is further supported by the in vitro cell viability and drug release data given in Fig. 3d–g, showing that the LC60-DI nanoparticles with a higher drug LC (that is, higher ICG in each nanoparticle) could release more drug and kill more cancer cells than the nanoparticles with a lower drug LC (that is, lower ICG in each nanoparticle) even though the total doses of DOX/ICG and NIR laser irradiation are the same. Presumably, the temperature in each nanoparticle with a higher drug LC is higher under the same dose of NIR laser irradiation, triggering more drug release from the nanoparticle and killing more cancer cells. This should also contribute to the better tumor destruction in vivo with the LC60-DI nanoparticles made with a high drug feeding ratio of DOX to nanoparticle (1:0.5) given the same total doses of DOX/ICG and laser irradiation (Fig. 5a–c).

In summary, both the EE and LC of theranostic agents are important parameters of multifunctional nanoparticles for drug delivery. To achieve high EE, low drug-to-nanoparticle feeding ratios have often been used for encapsulation, which in turn results in low drug LC. We have developed a eukaryotic cell-like nanoplatform, or EukaCell, which can be used to achieve high EE (∼100%) and LC (up to ∼87%) of theranostic agents (DOX and ICG). As schematically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 25, release of the encapsulated drug can be precisely controlled using NIR laser irradiation to minimize the potential side effects.

### Brain temperature during 340-kHz pulsed ultrasound insonation: a safety study for sonothrombolysis [^114YqqrZ]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Because ultrasound is used for improving thrombolysis of cerebral infarction but continuous ultrasound insonation also has significant thermal effects, we evaluated brain temperature increase and tissue destruction during pulsed ultrasound emission.

- **Methods**: We examined 340-kHz pulsed ultrasound effects in male Wistar rats. Ultrasound was applied transcranially for 30 minutes at different power levels (1 to 7 W/cm²). Temperature was measured at different locations including the brain, in the focus of the ultrasound beam, inner ear, temporalis muscle, and rectum. The cooling time after 30-minute insonation for each power level was recorded, and animals were examined postmortem using brain histology (TUNEL and hematoxylin/eosin).

- **Results**: Brain temperature increased within 2 to 5 minutes of insonation. Brain temperature increase and cooling time were proportional to power level, and even with the highest intensity of 7 W/cm² for 30 minutes, the maximum elevation of mean brain temperature was 0.9 degrees C, with the highest cooling time of 40 minutes. No deleterious side effects of this treatment could be found in histological examination.

- **Conclusions**: Using a pulsed ultrasound design, only a moderate temperature increase could be observed with no histopathological abnormalities. Deleterious side effects of mid-kilohertz ultrasound, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, are therefore not a consequence of local brain temperature increase.

### Response to sublethal heat treatment of prostatic tumor cells and of prostatic tumor infiltrating T-cells [^116BqLNx]. The Prostate (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the possibilities offered by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in the field of tumor vaccination, we analyzed how prostatic cancer (CaP) cells react towards heat treatment and whether increased access to CaP cells by the immune system would be the result.

- **Methods**: Heat/stress response of CaP cells in situ and of CaP cell lines was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and Atlas array. A heat-induced change in immune recognition was analyzed functionally using human T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokine release with tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TIL) as responder and autologous CaP cells, either heated or untreated, as stimulator cells.

- **Results**: Transcription of 68 out of 500 genes was upregulated by sublethal heat in LNCaP and PC3 cells. Significantly upregulated stress protein (SP) expression (HSP-72, -73, GRP-75, -78) was seen at the border zone of HIFU treatment. Remarkably, even untreated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens revealed relative overexpression of heat shock protein (HSP)-72, -73 and glucose regulated protein (GRP)-75, -78. Heated CaP cells increased Th1 cytokine (IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) release but decreased Th2 cytokine (IL-4, -5, -10) release of TIL.

- **Conclusions**: HIFU treatment may alter the presentation of prostate tissue and tumor antigens, and this presentation is most likely stimulatory. HSP-72/73 overexpression in untreated BPH may suggest a mechanism by which BPH can incite inflammation.

### Enhanced tumor uptake and penetration of virotherapy using polymer stealthing and focused ultrasound [^1148rqJQ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of metastatic cancer may require therapies that can be administered intravenously and accumulate within all disease deposits. Oncolytic viruses have the potential to powerfully and selectively kill cancer cells. However, similar to other macromolecular therapeutics, the intravenous delivery and antitumor activity of oncolytic viruses are limited by poor bloodstream stability, extravasation from the bloodstream into the tumor, and penetration through the tumor. The impact of these limitations is exemplified by the fact that, in preclinical studies, oncolytic Ads required a 1000-fold higher intravenous dose to match the efficacy of intratumoral injection, despite the difficulties faced in achieving consistent intratumoral injection. Failure to overcome these limitations has led to a lack of progress in expanding the clinical utility of Ads beyond their use in direct intratumoral delivery regimens.

We describe a hydrazone bond–containing copolymer that can stealth Ads, which cleaves upon exposure to pH levels similar to those present within tumors. This allows efficient coating to provide blood stability and avoidance of liver capture while also enabling uncoating and reactivation for antitumor activity. Stealthing lowers liver capture/toxicity by increasing the diameter of the Ad above the size of the hepatic sinusoidal fenestrae and by lowering Kupffer cell–mediated capture. The net result was enhanced circulation, and in accordance with the enhanced permeability retention effect and our own previous studies, this ultimately provided increased tumor uptake and penetration.

### Engineering micro oxygen factories to slow tumour progression via hyperoxic microenvironments [^112LxmZ7]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Although surgery is the first choice for 30–40% of cancer patients at every early (Stage 0) or early (Stage I) stage, PMCs may be administered alone or may act synergistically with the effects of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and interventional, immune, and targeted therapies in cancer patients at intermediate or late stages (> Stage II) to establish local control and palliation. The PMCs were deliberately designed to accommodate the interventional device. Although intratumor injection was selected for the administration of PMCs in animals, PMCs could be applied in human patients by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. To facilitate future clinical applications, the dose and duration of NIR radiation should be carefully examined.

Taking hepatocarcinoma as an example, 900 mW/cm² NIR radiation at 980 nm was applied to rabbits for 60 min/day. Given that the depth of hepatocarcinoma in rabbits is 0.3–0.7 cm, the tumour received 300–500 mW/cm² radiation after penetration of the animal belly. To acquire such excitation intensity in human patients, the radiation dose has to be increased to 2000 mW/cm², or the duration should be extended to 180 min, because hepatocarcinoma in human patients is often deeper than in rabbits and because the intensity of NIR radiation at 980 nm would decline to < 30% after penetration of 0.7–1.0 cm belly tissues in humans. However, this amount of NIR radiation may induce hyperthermia damage. Alternatively, NIR-II radiation at 1200–1700 nm would be more suitable for clinical applications, as NIR-II photons have a much higher penetration capacity.

### High intensity focused ultrasound hemigland ablation for prostate cancer: Initial outcomes of a United States series [^112zgVKJ]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

We report outcomes of hemigland high intensity focused ultrasound ablation as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer in the United States.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 100 consecutive men underwent hemigland high intensity focused ultrasound from December 2015 to December 2019. The primary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as Grade Group 2 or greater on follow-up prostate biopsy, radical treatment, systemic therapy, metastases, or prostate cancer-specific mortality. IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function), I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), and 90-day complications were reported.

- **Results**: At study entry, patients had very low (8%), low (20%), intermediate favorable (50%), intermediate unfavorable (17%), and high (5%) risk prostate cancer. Median follow-up was 20 months. The 2-year survival free from treatment failure, Grade Group 2 or greater recurrence, repeat focal high intensity focused ultrasound, and radical treatment was 73%, 76%, 90%, and 91%, respectively. Bilateral prostate cancer at diagnosis was the sole predictor for Grade Group 2 or greater recurrence (p = 0.03). Of men who underwent post-treatment biopsy (58), 10 had in-field and 8 out-of-field Grade Group 2 or greater positive biopsy. Continence (zero pad) was maintained in 100% of patients. Median IIEF-5 and I-PSS scores before vs. after hemigland high intensity focused ultrasound were 22 vs. 21 (p = 0.99) and 9 vs. 6 (p = 0.005), respectively. Minor and major complications occurred in 13% and 0% of patients. No patient had rectal fistula or died.

### In vitro effect of focused ultrasound or thermal stress on HSP70 expression and cell viability in three tumor cell lines [^116LzW5M]. Academic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the effect of focused ultrasound with the effect of thermal stress on the induction of a heat-inducible promoter in an in vitro model using three tumor cell lines: M21, SCCVII, and NIH3T3.

- **Materials and methods**: We used a reporter construct generated using the stress-inducible promoter from the gene encoding a murine 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (HSP70A.1) and a luciferase (luc) reporter plasmid. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was applied in two different modes: one with increasing voltage at constant pulse duration and another with constant voltage at increasing pulse duration. HIFU or thermal stress was delivered over a range of temperatures (36–52 degrees C) for 5 minutes, and the resulting luciferase activity was measured in live cells using a cooled charge-coupled device camera as a measure of reporter gene transcription. Luciferase activity was measured at set time intervals for a total of 108 hours post-stress.

- **Results**: Both methods induced the HSP70 promoter. However, the luciferase activity under the influence of HIFU, independent of the applied mode, and thermal stress differs, despite the fact that the temperature was the same. In the M21 tumor cell line, the maximum luciferase activity after focused ultrasound application was 4818 ± 1521% at a temperature of 48 degrees C and after thermal stress 4468.2 ± 1890.2% at a temperature of 52 degrees C, with a viability of 72.3 ± 5.2% and 85 ± 3.4%, respectively.

### The roles of thermal and mechanical stress in focused ultrasound-mediated immunomodulation and immunotherapy for central nervous system tumors [^111mMijH]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology, offering the capability of tuning and prescribing thermal and mechanical treatments within the brain. While early works in utilizing this technology have mainly focused on maximizing the delivery of therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the potential therapeutic impact of FUS-induced controlled thermal and mechanical stress to modulate anti-tumor immunity is becoming increasingly recognized.

To better understand the roles of FUS-mediated thermal and mechanical stress in promoting anti-tumor immunity in central nervous system tumors, we performed a comprehensive literature review on focused ultrasound-mediated immunomodulation and immunotherapy in brain tumors.

- **Summary of clinical experience**: We summarize the clinical experience with immunotherapy.
- **Unique immunomodulatory effects**: We discuss the unique and distinct immunomodulatory effects of the FUS-mediated thermal and mechanical stress in the brain tumor-immune microenvironment.
- **Combination with immune adjuvants**: Recent findings indicate that its combination with immune adjuvants can promote robust responses in brain tumors.

Along with the rapid advancement of FUS technologies into recent clinical trials, this technology through mild hyperthermia, thermal ablation, mechanical perturbation mediated by microbubbles, and histotripsy each inducing distinct vascular and immunological effects, offers the unique opportunity to improve immunotherapeutic trafficking. It has the potential to convert immunologically "cold" tumors into immunologically "hot" ones that are prone to generate profound immune responses.

### Hyperthermia induces endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis in melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer cells [^115PBmsK]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperthermia has been revived as a promising approach for cancer treatment. To understand the underlying mechanisms of hyperthermic killing of cancer cells, we examined the cytotoxic effects of hyperthermia on various skin cancer cell lines using cell viability, morphological analyses, and caspase activation assays. Hyperthermia induced cytotoxicity in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. At middle dose/time combinations, heat-induced apoptosis, whereas at higher doses, necrosis was the mechanism of cell death.

To investigate the mechanisms of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis, we examined the activation of extrinsic (caspase 8) and intrinsic (caspase 9) apoptotic pathways. Hyperthermia did not activate caspases 8 or 9, but did activate caspase 3/7, suggesting a non-conventional apoptotic pathway. Last, analysis of Grp78 expression and caspase 12 or 4 activation indicated that hyperthermia induced endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis. Thus, hyperthermia induced apoptosis in two types of skin cancer cells through endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis and not through the classical intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis pathways.

Hyperthermia may be a promising treatment for basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, bypassing the antiapoptotic defenses concentrated in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. These results also raise the possibility that heat may be combined with other approaches for induction of apoptosis to achieve synergistic killing of skin cancers.

### Locoregional thermal and chemical tumor ablation: Review of clinical applications and potential opportunities for use in low- and middle-income countries [^1166q5ax]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Microwave ablation (MWA) is a recent thermal ablation method that has become an effective alternative to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (Fig 1 B). MWA uses antenna probes and frequencies ranging from 900 to 2,450 MHz to heat and kill tumors. Specifically, the electromagnetic interaction between microwaves and biological tissues creates a local temperature increase due to the oscillation of polar molecules in water within the tissue. Hyperthermic temperatures up to 150°C are ultimately achieved, causing local ablation of tumors via coagulative necrosis. A typical MWA treatment applies a power of 30–100 W for 2–10 minutes, depending on the size of lesions.

- **Clinical applications**: MWA has been used to treat tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, bone, and, to a lesser extent, the pancreas. Like RFA, MWA is commonly performed with imaging modalities, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in minimally invasive image-guided ablation procedures. Overall survival (OS) for patients treated with MWA depends on the type of cancer. MWA has similar minor complications as RFA and may have similar or better outcomes in specific clinical settings, such as larger solitary liver lesions less than 5 cm in diameter.

- **Advantages**: MWA and RFA appear to have similar treatment outcomes in some settings. MWA, however, achieves ablation temperatures and induces thermal coagulation faster than RFA due to deeper penetration of the microwave energy through various tissues and less susceptibility to the heat-sink effect. The average ablation time of MWA procedures is less than RFA. MWA is capable of ablating larger tumors (up to approximately 6 cm) and can obtain similar therapeutic outcomes.

### Focused ultrasound: Noninvasive image-guided therapy [^117Sku9c]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Basic principles of MR temperature mapping with the water proton resonance frequency method**: The PRF methods usually employ rapid RF-spoiled gradient echo imaging. Following image processing, an MR signal is associated with each volume element as a complex number. Gray levels on anatomical images are proportional to the MR signal magnitude value, whereas its phase relates to the PRF. Temperature variation is calculated from phase changes for each voxel obtained at different times, where Δϕ is the phase difference, ΔT the temperature variation, γ the gyromagnetic ratio (~42.58.2π.10^6 rad/T), α the temperature coefficient (~0.01 ppm/K), TE the echo time, and B0 the main magnetic field. The presence of lipids is a potential source of artifacts because the temperature dependency of the resonance frequency of lipid hydrogen is near zero. In practice, lipid contribution to the MR signal can be conveniently suppressed in gradient echo imaging by frequency-selective slice excitation or alternative methods such as selective fat saturation, inversion recovery, and multiecho methods combined with model-based reconstruction methods.

High temperatures lead to coagulation and immediate cell death. However, moderate temperature elevations may also lead to cell death, albeit with a delayed effect via biochemical pathways leading to apoptosis. The lethal effects of elevated temperatures have been studied by Sapareto and Dewey, who established an empirical relation among temperature, duration of exposure, and cell death. Using such relations, temperature measurements throughout the procedure can be effectively managed.

### Enhanced tumor uptake and penetration of virotherapy using polymer stealthing and focused ultrasound [^115y5U5v]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Oncolytic viruses are among the most powerful and selective cancer therapeutics under development and are showing robust activity in clinical trials, particularly when administered directly into tumor nodules. However, their intravenous administration to treat metastatic disease has been stymied by unfavorable pharmacokinetics and inefficient accumulation in and penetration through tumors.

- **Methods**: Adenovirus (Ad) was "stealthed" with a new N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide polymer, and circulation kinetics were characterized in Balb/C SCID mice (n = 8 per group) bearing human ZR-75–1 xenograft tumors. To noninvasively increase extravasation of the circulating polymer-coated Ad into the tumor, it was coinjected with gas microbubbles, and the tumor was exposed to 0.5 MHz focused ultrasound at a peak rarefactional pressure of 1.2 MPa. These ultrasound exposure conditions were designed to trigger inertial cavitation, an acoustic phenomenon that produces shock waves and can be remotely monitored in real-time. Groups were compared with Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey correction where groups were greater than two. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: The polymer-coating of Ad reduced hepatic sequestration and infection by more than 8,000-fold (P < .05), and enhanced tumor infection by more than 30-fold when combined with gas bubbles and focused ultrasound (4×10^6 photons/sec/cm^2; standard deviation = 3×10^6 with ultrasound vs 1.3×10^5; standard deviation = 1×10^5 without ultrasound).

### Temperature-sensitive liposome-based cancer nanomedicine enables tumour lymph node immune microenvironment remodelling [^1157pcEK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Targeting the tumour immunosuppressive microenvironment is a crucial strategy in immunotherapy. However, the critical role of the tumour lymph node (LN) immune microenvironment (TLIME) in tumour immune homeostasis is often ignored. Here, we present a nanoinducer, NIL-IM-Lip, that remodels the suppressed TLIME by simultaneously mobilizing T and NK cells. The temperature-sensitive NIL-IM-Lip is first delivered to tumours and then directed to the LNs following pH-sensitive shedding of the NGR motif and MMP2-responsive release of IL-15.

IR780 and 1-MT induce immunogenic cell death and suppress regulatory T cells simultaneously during photo-thermal stimulation. We demonstrate that combining NIL-IM-Lip with anti-PD-1 significantly enhances the effectiveness of T and NK cells, leading to greatly suppressed tumour growth in both hot and cold tumour models, with complete response in some instances. Our work thus highlights the critical role of TLIME in immunotherapy and provides proof of principle to combine LN targeting with immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.

### Focused ultrasound for the treatment of glioblastoma [^116iup8L]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Kelsie Timbie, Ph.D., presented a prerecorded talk on the state of focused ultrasound immunomodulation research. She provided a review of the literature and described the foundation's first multisite GBM consortium project, which began in 2016 to investigate the effects of different focused ultrasound modalities on the immune system and cancer immunity cycle. Each of the seven participating centers used the same animal model of GBM, and results varied. The group using thermal ablation was the only one to achieve tumor growth control. Thermal ablation did not achieve an immune response in the tumor, but hyperthermia increased infiltration of activated NK, effector CD8 cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). In contrast, mechanical ablation with histotripsy increased proliferation of CD3-positive, CD4-positive, and CD8-positive T cells. Histotripsy also enhanced dendritic cell activation, decreased MDSCs, and increased interferon gamma production. Overall, the main takeaway was that different focused ultrasound mechanisms have vastly different effects on the immune system.

During the panel discussion, moderator Michael Lim, M.D., and panelists Costas Arvanitis, Ph.D. Timothy Bullock, Ph.D. Theresa LaVallee, Ph.D., and Tao Sun, Ph.D., described several of these immune responses to focused ultrasound and discussed ways to monitor them. Future research suggestions included considering the intersection of focused ultrasound–enhanced immunomodulation with GBM lymphatics and more precisely determining the role of focused ultrasound for GBM immunomodulation.

### Sonodynamic therapy and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound: New therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma [^111RC8jj]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

The effects of thermal ablation on tumoral cells are not yet completely clear. It has been demonstrated that hyperthermia (HT) can enhance the 5-ALA-SDT induced cell apoptosis partly by activating caspases and by modulating Bcl-2 family members. Moreover, HT increases ROS production and reduces metalloproteases (MMPs) induced by 5-ALA-SDT in human glioma cells.

- **Mechanism of action of sonodynamic therapy**: Sonodynamic therapy could be effective in glioma cell death through the transformation of 5-ALA (green dots) to PPIX (red dots). This process results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cell death.

- **Representation of mechanisms of sonodynamic therapy**:
	- **A**: 5-ALA SDT could reduce levels of Bcl-2, thus activating apoptosis via the caspase 9 pathway.
	- **B**: 5-ALA SDT increases levels of ROS, thus inducing cell death.
	- **C**: Heating itself could increase the level of heat shock protein 70, thus inducing an immune response through structural changes in the cell membrane.

HT can also regulate molecular aspects of the immune response, such as the Fas gene and its ligand FasL, acting as an immunomodulator in cancer therapy. Specifically, the increase in local temperature may act as a natural trigger or danger signal to the immune system. Hyperthermia can therefore enhance the expression of FAS-ligand mRNA, which plays a role in the functional maturation of dendritic cells. This is accompanied by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate T lymphocytes and induce a polarization toward a Th1 phenotype.

Regarding medical management for hepatocellular carcinoma, specifically in the context of managing early disease and local ablation, the BSG 2024 guidelines recommend offering thermal ablative therapy — with radiofrequency or microwave — as the first-line treatment in selected patients with solitary < 2 cm HCC in compensated cirrhosis. The choice between ablation and resection in patients at this tumor stage should be based on an evaluation of tumor location, liver function associated with the extent of portal hypertension, and performance status.

- **Incubation**: Using tongs, move Vial 1 to the heating hole of the dry bath, maintaining a temperature of 95°C (203°F), not exceeding 98°C (208°F), for at least 7 minutes without agitation or stirring. After 7 minutes, remove the vial, place it in an appropriate lead shield, and allow it to cool to room temperature for approximately 10 minutes. Assay the entire vial containing the gallium Ga 68 dotatate injection for total radioactivity concentration using a dose calibrator and record the result. Perform quality controls according to recommended methods to ensure compliance with specifications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Prior to use, inspect the solution behind a shielded screen for radioprotection purposes; only use solutions that are clear, without visible particles. Keep the vial containing the gallium Ga 68 dotatate injection upright in a radio-protective shielded container at a temperature below 25°C (77°F) until use. After adding gallium-68 chloride to the reaction vial, use the gallium Ga 68 dotatate injection within 4 hours. After radiolabeling, do not perform further dilutions.

- **Administration**: Prior to use, visually inspect the prepared gallium Ga 68 dotatate injection behind a lead glass shield for radioprotection purposes. Only use solutions that are clear and without visible particles.

### First clinical experience with a dedicated MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound system for breast cancer ablation [^11736aRP]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Our results show that MR-HIFU ablation in breast cancer patients with the dedicated breast system is safe and feasible. In none of the patients was skin redness or burns observed. A good correlation was found between the product of duration and power of sonications (i.e. the applied energy) and the size of tumor necrosis at histopathology (r = 0.76, p = 0.002). Furthermore, in the patients with tumor necrosis at histopathology, the number of targeted locations was equal to the number of areas with tumor necrosis.

No relationship was found between the applied energy and the increase in temperature. Particularly, between different patients, we observed that the acoustic powers required to achieve a certain increase in temperature varied considerably. This variation may be explained by differences in tumor perfusion and patient characteristics, such as breast size or the ratio between glandular and adipose tissue. Another factor influencing the extent of temperature increase is the distance between tumor and ultrasound transducers. In our system, the circular arc of transducers covers 270°. If the targeted area is close to the 'open' part of the arc of transducers, higher powers may be needed to achieve the same increase in temperature. Lastly, the measured temperatures are largely dependent on the position of the MR thermometry slices. During certain treatments (e.g. patients six and nine), the measured temperature increase was not as high as one would expect based on other treatments (e.g. patients four and five) due to incorrect misalignment.

### Treatment with high intensity focused ultrasound: Secrets revealed [^115Y7ftu]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

For many decades, open surgery remained the only option for local control of body tumors. To decrease patients' morbidity and mortality, several image-guided minimally invasive procedures have been adopted. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an extracorporeal, non-invasive method for tumor ablation. High-intensity ultrasonic waves can be focused to a focal point, resulting in a lethal elevation of temperature at the target site, thereby damaging the tumoral cells. Recent advances in HIFU technology have expanded its applications to include the ablation of both benign and malignant tumors, with different treatment strategies being implemented for each type. This review aims to introduce the reader to the details of the treatment process, including pretreatment preparation, treatment planning, ablation strategies, patient aftercare, and follow-up regimens for the most common HIFU applications.

### Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound, a novel application for interventional nuclear medicine [^1118a6aw]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been increasingly used in medicine over the past few decades, and several systems for such have become commercially available. HIFU has passed regulatory approval around the world for the ablation of various solid tumors, the treatment of neurologic diseases, and the palliative management of bone metastases. The mechanical and thermal effects of focused ultrasound provide a possibility for histotripsy, supportive radiation therapy, and targeted drug delivery. The integration of imaging modalities into HIFU systems allows for precise temperature monitoring and accurate treatment planning, increasing the safety and efficiency of treatment. Preclinical and clinical results have demonstrated the potential of image-guided HIFU to reduce adverse effects and increase the quality of life postoperatively. Interventional nuclear image-guided HIFU is an attractive noninvasive option for the future.

### Sonogenetic control of multiplexed genome regulation and base editing [^114gLA7y]. Nature Communications (2023). Low credibility.

With our focused ultrasound setup, the tumor was visualized while the acoustic focus was localized to the center of the tumor for heating. We set the ultrasound system to increase the tumor temperature to 43 °C for a duration of 15 minutes. Careful planning of the acoustic energy output and targeting minimized off-target energy deposition, resulting in no apparent damage to the mouse skin or tissue. The tumors were extracted 24 hours after HIFU treatment and analyzed by flow cytometry for mCherry reporter activation. In the untreated tumor, we observed little mCherry expression, while the treated tumor showed a significant increase in mCherry positive cells. The variation of reporter activation across the animals probably arises from varied efficiency of ultrasound absorption and heat dissipation in the tumor. Nonetheless, this in vivo HIFU experiment has verified that focused ultrasound is compatible with CRISPR/Cas tools in animal models. We hypothesize that by changing the guide RNA, we can non-invasively activate any gene or combination of genes of interest at specific locations in vivo with controlled timing through a guided HIFU treatment.

### The influence of blood supply on high intensity focused ultrasound a preliminary study on rabbit hepatic VX2 tumors of different ages [^115uvHyu]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of blood supply on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) applied to rabbit hepatic VX2 tumors of different ages.

- **Materials and methods**: Eighteen rabbits with VX2 hepatic tumors were randomly divided into three groups according to the time of sacrifice after tumor implantation: 10, 15, or 20 days. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was performed immediately before HIFU ablation. The same settings for HIFU dose parameters were used to ablate the central tumor area in each group, and the real-time temperature of the targeted site of the tumor was measured. After HIFU, the coagulation necrosis volumes of tumor tissue and the microvascular density of residual tumor tissue were determined.

- **Results**: Histopathologic analysis showed that the extent of a tumor's blood supply followed the order 10-day group > 15-day group > 20-day group (P > .05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of temperature-decrease parameters during HIFU treatment and in terms of necrosis volumes after HIFU treatment (P < .05). Necrosis volume was inversely related to absolute enhanced intensity (r = -0.823, P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: The extent of a tumor's blood supply had a significant effect on the temperature-decrease phase but not on the temperature-increase phase during HIFU treatment.

### Tumor ablation: Common modalities and general practices [^114Ltrr4]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Tumor ablation is a minimally invasive technique commonly used in treating tumors of the liver, kidney, bone, and lung. During tumor ablation, thermal energy is used to heat or cool tissue to cytotoxic levels — less than -40°C or more than 60°C. An additional technique under development targets the permeability of the cell membrane and is ostensibly nonthermal.

- **Modalities used worldwide**: Within the classification of tumor ablation, several modalities are utilized globally, including radiofrequency, microwave, laser, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation. Each technique, although similar in purpose, has specific and optimal indications.

This review serves to discuss general principles and techniques, reviews each modality, and discusses modality selection.

### First clinical experience with a dedicated MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound system for breast cancer ablation [^114gu68i]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the safety and feasibility of MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation in breast cancer patients, a study was conducted using a dedicated breast platform. Patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer underwent partial tumor ablation prior to surgical resection. The MR-HIFU ablation was performed using proton resonance frequency shift MR thermometry and an MR-HIFU system specifically designed for breast tumor ablation. The presence and extent of tumor necrosis were assessed by histopathological analysis of the surgical specimen. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the relationship between sonication parameters, temperature increase, and the size of tumor necrosis at histopathology.

Ten female patients underwent MR-HIFU treatment. No skin redness or burns were observed in any of the patients. No correlation was found between the applied energy and the temperature increase. In six patients, tumor necrosis was observed with a maximum diameter of 3–11 mm. In these patients, the number of targeted locations corresponded to the number of areas with tumor necrosis. A good correlation was found between the applied energy and the size of tumor necrosis at histopathology (Pearson = 0.76, p = 0.002).

Our results demonstrate that MR-HIFU ablation with the dedicated breast system is safe and leads to histopathologically proven tumor necrosis.

- **Key points**: MR-HIFU ablation with the dedicated breast system is safe and feasible. In none of the patients was skin redness or burns observed. No correlation was found…

### Application of oncolytic virus in tumor therapy [^114vccod]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Oncolytic viruses (OVs) can selectively kill tumor cells without affecting normal cells and activate the innate and adaptive immune systems in patients. Thus, they have been considered a promising measure for safe and effective cancer treatment. Recently, a few genetically engineered OVs have been developed to further improve the effect of tumor elimination by expressing specific immune regulatory factors, thus enhancing the body's antitumor immunity. In addition, the combined therapies of OVs and other immunotherapies have been applied in clinical settings.

Although there are many studies on this hot topic, a comprehensive review is missing on illustrating the mechanisms of tumor clearance by OVs and how to modify engineered OVs to further enhance their antitumor effects. In this study, we provided a review on the mechanisms of immune regulatory factors in OVs. Furthermore, we reviewed the combined therapies of OVs with other treatments, including radiotherapy and CAR-T or TCR-T cell therapy. The review is useful in further generalizing the usage of OVs in cancer treatment.

### Intracranial applications of MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound [^112WVWWH]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Initially used in the treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, the role of focused ultrasound has expanded as transcranial acoustic wave distortion and other limitations have been overcome. Its utility relies on focal energy deposition via acoustic wave propagation. The duty cycle and intensity of focused ultrasound influence the rate of energy deposition and result in unique physiologic and biomechanical effects.

Thermal ablation via high-intensity continuous exposure generates coagulative necrosis of tissues. High-intensity, pulsed application reduces temporally averaged energy deposition, resulting in mechanical effects such as reversible, localized BBB disruption, which enhances neurotherapeutic agent delivery. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, low-intensity, pulsed exposures can influence neuronal activity with preservation of cytoarchitecture. Its noninvasive nature, high-resolution, and radiation-free features allow focused ultrasound to compare favorably with other modalities.

### New treatments for localized prostate cancer [^1177MFKE]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Interest in focal therapy for prostate cancer has recently been renewed owing to downward stage migration, improved biopsy and imaging techniques, and the prevalence of either unifocal cancer or a dominant cancer with secondary tumors of minimal malignant potential. Several techniques have potential for focal ablation of prostate cancer. Cryotherapy has been used for some time as primary therapy for complete ablation of the prostate or local recurrence after radiotherapy. Enthusiasm for cryotherapy as the primary therapy has been tempered by the uncertainty about complete ablation of the cancer, the frequent persistence of measurable prostate-specific antigen levels after the procedure, and a high rate of erectile dysfunction.

Studies have reported "focal ablation" of prostate cancer with cryotherapy, targeting one side of the gland to eliminate cancer confined to that side with less risk of urinary or sexual complications. Whether cryotherapy has sufficient power to eradicate focal cancer and can be targeted with sufficient accuracy to avoid damage to surrounding structures remains to be demonstrated in prospective clinical trials.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been used widely in Europe for complete ablation of the prostate, especially in elderly men who are unwilling or unable to undergo radical therapy. For low- or intermediate-risk cancer, the short- and intermediate-term oncologic results have been acceptable but need confirmation in prospective multicenter trials currently underway.

### Photofrin [^114V6qc5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a separate retrospective analysis, patients were individually evaluated to identify those whose benefit-to-risk ratio was most favorable, i.e. those who obtained clinically important benefit with minimal adverse reactions. Clinically important benefit was defined as one of the following:

- **Substantial improvement in pulmonary symptoms**: At Month 1 or later, improvements were defined as dyspnea by 2 grades, hemoptysis by 3 grades, cough by 3 grades, or an increase in FEV1 by 40%.

- **Moderate improvement in symptoms**: At Month 2 or later, improvements included dyspnea by 1 grade, cough by 2 grades, hemoptysis by 2 grades, or an increase in FEV1 by 20%.

- **A durable objective tumor response**: Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) maintained to Month 2 or longer.

Thirty-six of the 99 PDT-treated patients (36%) and 23 of the 99 Nd:YAG-treated patients (23%) received clinically important benefit with only minimal or moderate toxicities of short duration. Thirty-four of the 99 PDT-treated patients demonstrated improvements in two or more efficacy endpoints, which included dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, sputum, atelectasis, pulmonary function tests such as FEV1 or FVC, Karnofsky Performance Score, or tumor response. Furthermore, 29 patients exhibited improvements in three or more endpoints.

The median duration of documented benefit in the 36 patients was 63 days. Among these patients with late-stage obstructing lung cancer, median survival was 174 days for PDT-treated patients and 161 days for Nd:YAG-treated patients.

The efficacy of Photofrin PDT was also evaluated in the treatment of microinvasive endobronchial tumors in 62 inoperable patients across three non-comparative studies. Microinvasive lung cancer is defined histologically.

### Sorafenib with or without co-interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma [^1123jfVv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Thermal ablation is usually performed under imaging guidance, with a thin needle that is placed through the skin (percutaneously) into the tumor to release heat or cold energy and cause irreversible cell death. The techniques of thermal ablation mainly include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation, ultrasound ablation, and cryoablation. RFA and MWA work by converting electrical currents and electromagnetic waves into heat. Laser ablation destroys the tumor by direct heating with laser beams. Ultrasound ablation focuses ultrasonic beams on the target regions to induce a thermal effect and a cavitation effect. Cryoablation causes tissue injury through a process of freezing and rewarming. Both RFA and MWA have shown survival benefits for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to the BCLC staging system and treatment recommendations, ablation is suitable for HCC in very early (BCLC‐0) or early (BCLC‐A) stages. It has been reported that people with HCC receiving ablation have a similar prognosis as those receiving resection, especially in early‐stage HCC. Recently, percutaneous ablation was considered to reduce the risk of treatment changes from curative strategies to palliative strategies. In recently published studies, the application of percutaneous ablation in HCC management has exceeded the recommendations of the BCLC staging system and treatment strategy, achieving effective local tumor control.

The development of minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures followed, alongside catheter-based approaches such as stenting, endovascular surgery, chemoembolization, and brachytherapy, which minimize side effects and reduce risks to patients. Completely noninvasive procedures offer further benefits by reducing risk, procedure time, recovery time, and the potential for infection or other side effects. Focusing ultrasound waves from outside the body specifically at the disease site has proven to be a safe noninvasive approach to localized ablative hyperthermia, mechanical ablation, and targeted drug delivery.

Focused ultrasound as a medical intervention was proposed decades ago; however, it only became feasible to plan, guide, monitor, and control treatment procedures with advanced radiological imaging capabilities. The purpose of this review is to describe the imaging capabilities and approaches to perform these tasks, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. Some procedures are already in clinical practice, with more at the clinical trial stage.

- **Integration of imaging in workflow**: Imaging is fully integrated in the workflow and includes the following:
	1. Planning, with the definition of target regions and adjacent organs at risk.
	2. Real-time treatment monitoring via thermometry imaging, cavitation feedback, and motion control to assure targeting and safety for adjacent normal tissues.
	3. Evaluation of treatment efficacy through the assessment of ablation and physiological changes.

### Re-purposing cryoablation: A combinatorial 'therapy' for the destruction of tissue [^112yCU8W]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

It is now recognized that the tumor microenvironment creates a protective neo-tissue that isolates the tumor from the various defense strategies of the body. Evidence demonstrates that, with successive therapeutic attempts, cancer cells acquire resistance to individual treatment modalities. For example, exposure to cytotoxic drugs results in the survival of approximately 20–30% of the cancer cells, as only dividing cells succumb to each toxic exposure. With follow-up treatments, each additional dose results in tumor-associated fibroblasts secreting surface-protective proteins, which enhance cancer cell resistance. Similar outcomes are reported following radiotherapy.

These defensive strategies are indicative of evolved capabilities of cancer to assure successful tumor growth through well-established anti-tumor-protective adaptations. As such, successful cancer management requires the activation of multiple cellular 'kill switches' to prevent initiation of diverse protective adaptations.

Thermal therapies are unique treatment modalities typically applied as monotherapies (without repetition), thereby denying cancer cells the opportunity to express defensive mutations. Further, the destructive mechanisms of action involved with cryoablation (CA) include both physical and molecular insults, resulting in the disruption of multiple defensive strategies that are not cell cycle dependent, and adds a damaging structural (physical) element. This review discusses the application and clinical outcomes of CA with an emphasis on the mechanisms of cell death induced by structural and metabolic factors.

### Spatio-temporal control of gene expression and cancer treatment using magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound [^111JFN5T]. Clinical Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Local temperature elevation may be used for tumor ablation, gene expression, drug activation, and gene and/or drug delivery. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is the only clinically viable technology that can achieve a local temperature increase deep inside the human body in a noninvasive way. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance of the procedure enables in situ target definition and identification of nearby healthy tissue to be spared. Additionally, MRI can provide continuous temperature mapping during HIFU for spatial and temporal control of the heating procedure and prediction of the final lesion based on the received thermal dose.

The primary purpose of developing MRI-guided HIFU was to achieve safe noninvasive tissue ablation. This technique has been extensively tested in preclinical studies and is now accepted in clinics for the ablation of uterine fibroids. MRI-guided HIFU for ablation shows conceptual similarities with radiation therapy. However, thermal damage generally exhibits threshold-like behavior, resulting in necrosis above the critical thermal dose and full recovery below.

MRI-guided HIFU is being clinically evaluated in the cancer field. The technology shows great promise for various advanced therapeutic methods, such as gene therapy. MR-guided HIFU, together with a temperature-sensitive promoter, provides local, physical, and spatio-temporal control of transgene expression. Specially designed contrast agents, combined with the use of MRI and ultrasound, may be employed for local gene and drug delivery.

### In-situ cryo-immune engineering of tumor microenvironment with cold-responsive nanotechnology for cancer immunotherapy [^113C85RQ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, with metastatic cancer being the major reason for cancer-related mortality. Harnessing the immune system to battle cancer via immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful and potentially revolutionizing strategy for treating cancer metastasis. Although therapeutic advances with tumor antigen vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and other cancer immunotherapy strategies have shown promising success in both pre-clinical and clinical studies of hematological malignancies, their efficacy in destroying solid tumors in most cancer patients has been limited. The immunosuppressive (i.e. immunologically cold) tumor microenvironment (TME), including malignant cells, deactivated/compromised immune cells, and soluble factors, is a key factor contributing to the poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy of solid tumors.

Cryosurgery has been proposed as a promising strategy to modulate the TME in cancer treatment. Cryosurgery is performed by cooling to cause ice formation (i.e. frostbite) in the tumor, which leads to cryoinjury and cancer cell death inside the frozen tissue iceball. This may result in the release of tumor antigens and the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules may provoke immunogenic cell death (ICD), shape an immuno-active (i.e. immunologically hot) TME, and further stimulate dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, as well as CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to execute antitumor immunotherapy.

### Magnetic resonance-guided shielding of prefocal acoustic obstacles in focused ultrasound therapy: Application to intercostal ablation in liver [^113sXLuT]. Investigative Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of liver cancer is a major public health issue because the liver is a frequent site for both primary and secondary tumors. Rib heating represents a major obstacle for the application of extracorporeal focused ultrasound to liver ablation. Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided external shielding of acoustic obstacles, such as the ribs, was investigated here to avoid unwanted prefocal energy deposition in the pathway of the focused ultrasound beam.

Ex vivo and in vivo experiments with seven female sheep were performed in this study. Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) was performed using a randomized 256-element phased-array transducer (f∼1 MHz) and a 3-T whole-body clinical MR scanner. A physical mask was inserted in the prefocal beam pathway, external to the body, to block the energy normally targeted on the ribs. The effectiveness of the reflecting material was investigated by characterizing the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound beam reflection and scattering on its surface using Schlieren interferometry.

Before high-intensity focused ultrasound sonication, the alignment of the protectors with the conical projections of the ribs was required and achieved in multiple steps using the embedded graphical tools of the MR scanner. Multiplanar near real-time MR thermometry (proton resonance frequency shift method) enabled the simultaneous visualization of the local temperature increase at the focal point and around the exposed ribs.

### Today's thermal therapy: Not your father's hyperthermia: Challenges and opportunities in application of hyperthermia for the 21st century cancer patient [^117LMNib]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The realization that hyperthermia was an ideal complementary treatment to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents from a biological perspective led to great enthusiasm for this modality over a quarter of a century ago. Unfortunately, this well-deserved enthusiasm quickly became tempered because of the inability to effectively heat tumors, particularly deep-seated ones with cumbersome first-generation technology coupled with still-emerging understandings of thermal biology. Today, as before, both challenges and opportunities remain in the application of hyperthermia for cancer patients. The lessons learned from the introduction of hyperthermia a generation ago are providing focus for the application of this still-promising modality in today's clinic.

- **Challenges and opportunities include**:
	- Thermal biology
	- Treatment planning, delivery, and monitoring
	- Successful high-quality clinical trials
	- Integration of thermal therapy with emerging technologies and therapeutic strategies both established and evolving

The progress made in understanding thermal biology, physics, and bioengineering, coupled with advances in complementary clinical treatment modalities, have all contributed to the next generation of clinical thermal therapy.

### Focal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of the prostate [^116w23zH]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

With the advancement of early detection tools for prostate cancer and the ability to better localize disease, there has been increased interest in focal or targeted therapies that carry less morbidity than traditional whole-gland treatments. The Sonablate® high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(K) clearance in the United States for ablation of prostate tissue. HIFU utilizes an ultrasound (US) transducer that focuses US beams on a preset point as much as 4cm from the energy source without injuring intervening tissue. The Sonablate system guides the surgeon step-by-step to perform effective ablation of a target lesion. The surgeon can assess treatment effect with tissue change monitoring, and care is taken to prevent rectal wall injury.

We believe hemiablation is the most favorable focal HIFU treatment to optimize cancer control and minimize the side effects associated with whole gland therapy. We recommend considering HIFU ablation as an extension of active surveillance rather than definitive treatment. Further research on long-term oncologic and functional outcomes is warranted.

### Spatiotemporal control of engineered bacteria to express interferon-γ by focused ultrasound for tumor immunotherapy [^1151bMaE]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

It needs to be pointed out that in vivo toxicity remains a concern for the clinical translation of bacteria-mediated immunotherapy. Our biosafety study showed that the URB + US treatment did not produce significant tissue damage or body weight changes in these mice (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 22). The good biosafety profile of the URB + US treatment may contribute not only to the targeted expression of cytokines, which reduces the risk of cytokine storms, but also to the rapid removal of bacteria by normal organs.

Scalability is also a critical issue that needs to be addressed for clinical application. A previous study reported a thermosensitive therapeutic bacterium that triggered in-situ TNF-α expression by near-infrared light. However, due to the poor tissue penetration of near-infrared light, it is difficult to act on deep-seated tumors in live animals. In contrast, ultrasound has higher tissue permeability and can irradiate deeper tumors situated in organs like the liver, pancreas, prostate, or ovary. Our results also confirmed that URB + US treatment could be applied to the orthotopically transplanted liver tumor (Fig. 7).

Although significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and good safety of URB + US treatment have been observed in this study, further steps are necessary for future clinical application. For example, the use of safer non-pathogenic bacteria or attenuated bacteria from which virulence genes have been deleted should be considered. Alternatively, it is possible to achieve acoustic control of therapeutic gene expression for anti-tumor therapy using T cells.

### Mild photothermal therapy potentiates anti-PD-L1 treatment for immunologically cold tumors via an all-in-one and all-in-control strategy [^111nio4e]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) that aims to reverse signals from the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is being driven as a primary treatment modality. The efficacy of ICB-based cancer immunotherapy largely depends on the expression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissues and the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). However, recent findings showed that many tumors do not contain high levels of TILs seemingly required to receive clinical benefit. These tumors, which are considered as immunologically "cold", do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although enhanced anti-PD therapy efficacy has been achieved in treating multiple tumor types in combination with various therapeutic strategies, such as chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, and other immunotherapies, strategies that can directly elevate the level of TILs in the TME, i.e. convert a "cold" tumor to a "hot" tumor, are still required to increase the potential responses to ICB.

Photothermal therapy (PTT) with the advantages of localized treatment, noninvasiveness, and controllable irradiation and temperature has emerged as a new paradigm toward precise cancer therapy. Typically, to achieve a relatively harsh environment for efficient ablation of tumors, rigorous photothermal heating to high temperatures over 50 °C is required, which will also destroy normal tissues. However, once the photothermal energy is reduced, the outcomes of PTT are dramatically impaired, and the PTT-induced abscopal effect is too weak to suppress the growth of the remaining tumor margin.

### In-situ cryo-immune engineering of tumor microenvironment with cold-responsive nanotechnology for cancer immunotherapy [^115XaRzE]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cancer immunotherapy, which deploys the host's immune system to recognize and attack tumors, is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is greatly restricted by the immunosuppressive (i.e. immunologically cold) tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we report an in-situ cryo-immune engineering (ICIE) strategy for turning the TME from immunologically "cold" into "hot". In particular, after the ICIE treatment, the ratio of the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells is increased by more than 100 times in not only the primary tumors with cryosurgery but also distant tumors without freezing.

This is achieved by combining cryosurgery that causes "frostbite" of the tumor with cold-responsive nanoparticles that not only target tumors but also rapidly release both anticancer drugs and PD-L1 silencing siRNA specifically into the cytosol upon cryosurgery. This ICIE treatment leads to potent immunogenic cell death, which promotes maturation of dendritic cells and the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as well as memory T cells to kill not only primary but also distant/metastatic breast tumors in female mice (i.e. the abscopal effect). Collectively, ICIE may enable an efficient and durable way to leverage the immune system for combating cancer and its metastasis.

### Ultrasound-controllable engineered bacteria for cancer immunotherapy [^1158CobV]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Rapid advances in synthetic biology are driving the development of genetically engineered microbes as therapeutic agents for a multitude of human diseases, including cancer. The immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors, in particular, creates a favorable niche for systemically administered bacteria to engraft and release therapeutic payloads. However, such payloads can be harmful if released outside the tumor in healthy tissues, where the bacteria also engraft in smaller numbers. To address this limitation, we engineer therapeutic bacteria to be controlled by focused ultrasound, a form of energy that can be applied noninvasively to specific anatomical sites such as solid tumors. This control is provided by a temperature-actuated genetic state switch that produces lasting therapeutic output in response to briefly applied focused ultrasound hyperthermia. Using a combination of rational design and high-throughput screening, we optimize the switching circuits of engineered cells and connect their activity to the release of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a clinically relevant cancer model, ultrasound-activated therapeutic microbes successfully turn on in situ and induce a marked suppression of tumor growth. This technology provides a critical tool for the spatiotemporal targeting of potent bacterial therapeutics in a variety of biological and clinical scenarios.

### Sonodynamic therapy and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound: New therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma [^11269zpL]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Conventional therapeutic options for the treatment of solid brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas (GBs), are based on the assumption that these cancerous lesions have relatively homogeneous spatiotemporal characteristics. However, recent advances in molecular, genetic, and epigenetic research have shown that this assumption is not accurate, highlighting the inherent limitations of radiation and chemotherapy. Additionally, the fact that GBs are not focal pathological entities but rather pathologies spread throughout the entire brain emphasizes the inherent limitations of surgery, even though it remains a primary treatment option for these tumors.

Therefore, there is a need to develop new therapeutic strategies capable of eradicating the underlying pathology in a minimally invasive manner, improving overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) while maintaining patients' quality of life and neurological status.

In this context, the use of ultrasound for therapeutic purposes, known as theranostics, offers interesting potential and promising results. Focused ultrasound (FUS) can be employed to destroy cancerous cells through heating or as an adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The main advantages of FUS are its non-invasiveness, incision-free procedure, controllability via real-time magnetic resonance (MR) guidance, and its capacity to activate the immune system. The first non-invasive thermal ablation of a brain tumor in humans was achieved by Coluccia et al. in their ongoing clinical phase I study in 2014, when they initially employed this technique.

### High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) triggers immune sensitization of refractory murine neuroblastoma to checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^111bmjiu]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy promises unprecedented benefits to patients with cancer; however, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma, remain immunologically unresponsive. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically "cold" tumors into responsive "hot" tumors.

- **Experimental design**: We treated less than 2% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU and assessed the systemic immune response using flow cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the immune response and long-term survival.

- **Results**: Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances antitumor response, improving survival from 0% to 62.5%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL2, IFNγ, and DAMPs, whereas immune regulators like CD4 + Foxp3 +, IL10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with checkpoint inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4 +, CD8α +, and CD8α + CD11c + cells, CD11c + in regional lymph nodes, and a decrease in circulating IL10 compared with the untreated group. We also report a significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and checkpoint inhibitors compared with tumors treated with HIFU or checkpoint inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, P < 0.0001).

### Heating the patient: A promising approach [^11478ufk]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

There is a clear rationale for using hyperthermia in cancer treatment. Treatment at temperatures between 40 and 44 degrees Celsius is cytotoxic for cells in an environment with a low pO₂ and low pH, conditions that are specifically found within tumor tissue due to insufficient blood perfusion. Under such conditions, radiotherapy is less effective, and systemically applied cytotoxic agents will reach such areas in lower concentrations than in well-perfused areas. Therefore, the addition of hyperthermia to radiotherapy or chemotherapy results in at least an additive effect. Furthermore, the effects of both radiotherapy and many drugs are enhanced at an increased temperature.

- **Applications of hyperthermia**: Hyperthermia can be applied by several methods:
	- Local hyperthermia by external or internal energy sources
	- Regional hyperthermia by perfusion of organs or limbs, or by irrigation of body cavities
	- Whole body hyperthermia

Use of hyperthermia alone has resulted in complete overall response rates of 13%. The clinical value of hyperthermia in addition to other treatment modalities has been shown in randomized trials. Significant improvement in clinical outcomes has been demonstrated for tumors of the head and neck, breast, brain, bladder, cervix, rectum, lung, esophagus, vulva and vagina, and also for melanoma. Additional hyperthermia resulted in remarkably higher (complete) response rates, accompanied by improved local tumor control rates, better palliative effects, and/or better overall survival rates. Generally, when combined with radiotherapy, there was no increase in radiation toxicity.

### Intraluminal high intensity ultrasound treatment in the esophagus under fast MR temperature mapping: in vivo studies [^1151dzj4]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

New curative and palliative treatments are needed to respond to the poor prognosis of esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR thermometry can be used to monitor the thermal ablation induced by an intraluminal high-intensity ultrasound applicator positioned in the esophagus. Experiments were performed in vivo in two pig esophagi (25 thermal lesions per pig).

Respiratory-gated or cardiac-gated MR thermometry was performed with segmented echo-planar imaging gradient echo sequences. All MR acquisitions were performed without susceptibility artifacts or radiofrequency interference with the ultrasound device. The experimental procedure proposed for accurate measurement of temperature in the esophagus was found to achieve an SD of ± 1.5 degrees C for respiratory gating and ± 3.1 degrees C for cardiac gating.

Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T(1)-weighted images were used to depict coagulation necrosis. Autopsy was performed immediately after the treatment. Ultrasound effects were inspected visually, and the dimensions of the lesions in the liver neighboring the esophagus were compared with those determined on the MRI images. The visually assessed thermal lesions showed good correlation with the MRI data (10% mean volume difference). The feasibility of esophageal thermal ablation using intraluminal high-intensity ultrasound and of online MR temperature monitoring was demonstrated.
