## Question

What to prescribe for a cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to prescribe for a cough, organized by duration, age, and etiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying cough by duration and identifying red flags. Then, I should verify age-specific safety and regulatory constraints. Next, I will examine acute cough management, including when to avoid antibiotics and what symptomatic options are reasonable. After that, I should review subacute and chronic cough pathways, including asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, GERD, eosinophilic bronchitis, and unexplained chronic cough. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical decision framework with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification and red flags, because misclassification drives inappropriate therapy. Cough is categorized as acute (< 3 weeks), subacute (3–8 weeks), and chronic (> 8 weeks in adults; > 4 weeks in children), and the first step is to estimate duration and screen for red flags such as hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, severe dyspnea, chest pain, or immunocompromise, which should prompt expedited evaluation and imaging rather than routine symptomatic management [^116C3J6t] [^117JktcY] [^116zhZPm].

> I need to ensure age-specific safety constraints are front and center before discussing any medication. In children, avoid codeine entirely due to respiratory depression risk, and avoid dextromethorphan under age 2; regulatory guidance advises against OTC cough/cold medicines in children under 4, and many pediatric guidelines discourage routine OTC cough medicines for acute cough given limited benefit and potential harms, so I should be cautious and prefer nonpharmacologic measures first [^1178JuvT] [^114WR9cu] [^113W7t1d].

> Now, for acute cough in immunocompetent adults, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. The CHEST expert panel suggests no routine investigations and no routine medications for suspected acute bronchitis, and high-quality data show that higher antibiotic prescribing rates across countries do not improve recovery from acute cough, reinforcing a conservative approach and stewardship imperative [^1146M1eL] [^116JHx9y]. I should double-check symptomatic options: NSAIDs are not recommended for cough due to common cold, and evidence for OTC antitussives, expectorants, and mucolytics is low quality with inconsistent results, so if used, it should be with informed consent about uncertain benefit and potential adverse effects [^112Gqh3M] [^113HzA7C].

> For pediatric acute cough, let me consider what is actually evidence-based. Guidelines suggest honey may offer modest relief compared with no treatment or diphenhydramine, but not clearly superior to dextromethorphan, and importantly honey should not be given to infants under 1 year due to botulism risk; otherwise, supportive care and observation are preferred given the self-limited nature of viral URTI and the lack of proven benefit from OTC cough medicines in children [^113W7t1d] [^1178JuvT] [^114WR9cu].

> But wait, what if the cough persists into the subacute window (3–8 weeks)? I should confirm whether it followed a viral illness, because postinfectious cough is common and often self-limited; if not postinfectious, I should manage it like chronic cough with a structured evaluation for the most common etiologies, including upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and GERD, using guideline-based algorithms and targeted trials where appropriate [^1154pf7d] [^116zhZPm].

> For chronic cough (> 8 weeks in adults), I will now examine the most likely causes and first-line therapies. Upper airway cough syndrome responds to a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant trial, asthma or cough-variant asthma warrants inhaled corticosteroids with or without bronchodilators, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is treated with ICS; GERD-related cough merits lifestyle modification and, when indicated, PPI therapy, though I should avoid empiric PPIs if there is a negative GERD workup to prevent overtreatment [^111guthx] [^112f21xq] [^116xJsdq] [^111QAu5c].

> Let me verify the approach to unexplained chronic cough after appropriate evaluation and trials. CHEST suggests a therapeutic trial of gabapentin with dose titration up to about 1,800 mg/day in divided doses, with reassessment of risks and benefits at 6 months, and ERS supports considering low-dose morphine (e.g., 5–10 mg twice daily) for refractory cases; speech and language therapy is also a reasonable nonpharmacologic option, and I should document shared decision-making given sedation and misuse risks with opioids [^113axWHu] [^114P88QZ] [^117TZ2n7].

> I should confirm special populations and nuanced scenarios. In pregnancy, avoid codeine and prioritize nonpharmacologic care; in older adults, be mindful of anticholinergic burden and falls risk with sedating agents; in ILD-associated cough, consider opioids for palliative symptom control when other therapies fail, with close monitoring; in pediatrics with chronic cough, a short trial of ICS may be considered for dry cough after excluding other causes, and macrolides are reserved for specific indications like protracted bacterial bronchitis rather than routine use [^116djRW8] [^114sXBrS] [^111P2Hpn].

> Hold on, I should verify the antibiotic decision points so I do not overgeneralize. Antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated acute bronchitis or viral URTI, but they are appropriate for confirmed bacterial pneumonia, pertussis early in the illness, selected bacterial sinusitis, and exacerbations of bronchiectasis or severe chronic bronchitis; delayed prescribing strategies can reduce unnecessary use without increasing adverse outcomes, and decision aids can help rule out pneumonia in primary care to curb overtreatment [^1146M1eL] [^113GbtsR] [^112Wv9Rb].

> Let me reconsider the role of mucoactive agents and bronchodilators in stable chronic bronchitis, because I initially thought they might help symptomatically; wait, I should double-check the guidelines. CHEST indicates insufficient evidence to support routine use of mucolytics or bronchodilators to relieve cough in stable chronic bronchitis, so I should avoid reflexively prescribing these unless there is a clear obstructive phenotype or other indication [^112sjUPJ] [^116y4KEW].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework and ensure it aligns with evidence. Start with duration and red flags; avoid routine antibiotics in acute viral cough; use first-line disease-specific therapy for chronic cough causes; reserve gabapentin or low-dose morphine for refractory unexplained cough after optimal etiologic management; and in children, prioritize honey for those over 1 year and avoid codeine and routine OTC cough medicines, documenting caregiver education and return precautions [^111TB45w] [^113axWHu] [^113W7t1d].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety monitoring are explicit. Reassess at 2–4 weeks for subacute cough and 4–6 weeks after initiating chronic cough therapy; monitor for opioid-related sedation, constipation, and misuse; and track response using validated tools where available, adjusting the plan based on adherence, side effects, and evolving diagnostic clarity [^116zhZPm] [^112TVkqS].

---

For acute cough, **no routine medications** are recommended [^1134dJJY]; use honey for children over 1 year [^113W7t1d] and consider dextromethorphan or guaifenesin for adults if needed [^115j1sKh]. For chronic cough, treat the **underlying cause** (UACS, asthma, GERD) [^111guthx] with first-generation antihistamine/decongestant, inhaled corticosteroids, or PPIs as indicated [^115GsoSY]. Avoid **codeine** in children [^1135GYQg] and use opioids only for severe, refractory cases with caution [^114P88QZ]. Antibiotics are not indicated for acute bronchitis or viral cough [^114hBege] [^116fEyFX]; reserve macrolides for refractory chronic bronchitis per guidelines [^111nRLzy]. Educate patients on the self-limited nature of acute cough and the importance of adherence to chronic cough therapy [^116VAif4].

---

## Acute cough (≤ 3 weeks)

### General principles

Most acute coughs are **viral and self-limited** [^116VAif4]; avoid routine medications [^1134dJJY] and reserve treatment for significant distress or specific indications [^1134dJJY]. Antibiotics are not indicated for acute bronchitis or viral coughs [^114hBege] [^116fEyFX].

---

### Recommended treatments

- **Honey**: For children ≥ 1 year, 2.5–5 mL before bedtime; more effective than no treatment or diphenhydramine, comparable to dextromethorphan [^113W7t1d] [^1178JuvT].
- **Dextromethorphan**: Adult option for suppressing cough reflex; limited evidence, use judiciously [^115j1sKh].
- **Guaifenesin**: Adult expectorant to thin secretions; limited evidence, use selectively [^115j1sKh].
- **First-generation antihistamine/decongestant**: Consider for UACS symptoms (e.g. chlorpheniramine with pseudoephedrine) [^111guthx].

---

### Treatments to avoid

Avoid **codeine-containing medications** in children due to respiratory depression risk [^1135GYQg] [^112m7xDn]. Routine use of **NSAIDs** is not recommended for acute cough [^112Gqh3M]. Antibiotics are not indicated for viral or acute bronchitis coughs [^114hBege] [^1134dJJY].

---

## Subacute cough (3–8 weeks)

Evaluate for **postinfectious cough** or evolving chronic conditions; manage as chronic cough if persistent [^1154pf7d]. Postinfectious cough may respond to inhaled corticosteroids or anticholinergics (e.g. ipratropium) [^1154pf7d].

---

## Chronic cough (> 8 weeks)

### General principles

Identify and treat the **underlying cause** — most commonly UACS, asthma, GERD, or NAEB [^111guthx] [^115GsoSY]. Use guideline-directed therapy and reassess response [^112GLrVy].

---

### Recommended treatments by underlying cause

| **Underlying cause** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) | First-generation antihistamine/decongestant (e.g. chlorpheniramine + pseudoephedrine) [^115GsoSY] |
| Asthma or cough-variant asthma | Inhaled corticosteroids ± bronchodilators [^112f21xq] [^116yzMa2] |
| Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) | Proton pump inhibitor + lifestyle modification [^111guthx] |
| Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) | Inhaled corticosteroids [^116xJsdq] |
| Unexplained chronic cough | Gabapentin or pregabalin after shared decision-making [^112tF1bg] [^1136XdHs] |

---

### Advanced therapies for refractory cases

Low-dose morphine (5–10 mg BID) may be used for **adults with chronic refractory cough** after other therapies fail [^114P88QZ]. Speech and language therapy is a **nonpharmacologic option** for chronic refractory cough [^113axWHu].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatrics

- **Avoid codeine**: Risk of respiratory depression [^1135GYQg] [^112m7xDn].
- **Avoid OTC cough/cold meds**: Especially in children < 2 years [^114WR9cu].
- **Honey**: For children ≥ 1 year with acute cough [^113W7t1d] [^1178JuvT].

---

### Elderly

Use caution with **sedating antihistamines** due to anticholinergic effects; consider non-sedating alternatives when appropriate.

---

### Pregnant patients

Avoid **codeine-containing medications**; prefer nonpharmacologic measures and agents with favorable safety profiles.

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize the **self-limited nature of acute cough** and the risks of unnecessary medications, especially antibiotics [^116VAif4] [^116JHx9y]. Ensure adherence to chronic cough therapy and arrange follow-up to assess response and adjust treatment [^116zhZPm].

---

## Cough management recommendations

| **Cough duration** | **Recommended treatments** | **Treatments to avoid** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute (≤ 3 weeks) | - Honey (≥ 1 year) <br/> - Dextromethorphan (adults) <br/> - Guaifenesin (adults) <br/> - First-generation antihistamine/decongestant (UACS) | - Codeine (children) <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Antibiotics (viral/acute bronchitis) |
| Subacute (3–8 weeks) | - Evaluate for postinfectious cough <br/> - Consider ICS or ipratropium | ∅ |
| Chronic (> 8 weeks) | - Treat underlying cause (UACS, asthma, GERD, NAEB) <br/> - Gabapentin/pregabalin (unexplained) <br/> - Low-dose morphine (refractory) | ∅ |

---

Effective cough management depends on **duration, cause, and patient factors** [^111TB45w]; prioritize treating the underlying cause, avoid unnecessary medications — especially antibiotics — and use evidence-based symptomatic options when needed.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Clinical updates in women's health care summary: acute cough: primary and preventive care review [^116VAif4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute cough is a common presenting symptom in the ambulatory care setting in the United States. It imposes a significant symptom burden on patients and financial burden on the health care system. In most cases, acute cough is caused by a benign viral infection that will resolve without intervention. When needed, there are few evidence-based interventions to hasten the resolution of cough symptoms. Patients may request antibiotics or prescription cough syrups; however, these medications have little evidence of benefit and can be potentially harmful to the patient. It can be challenging for the clinician to provide reassurance while minimizing unnecessary prescriptions. The health care provider also must be alert to signs and symptoms that could signal a high-risk diagnosis that requires urgent evaluation. This monograph provides a review of the differential diagnosis for acute cough, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of cough, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Also, it highlights warning signs and symptoms that should trigger an emergent referral and special clinical considerations in more vulnerable patient populations, including pregnant patients and geriatric patients.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^115Wgf3o]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cough is the most common symptom for which medical advice is sought. It is responsible for over 50% of new patient attendance in primary care and is the major source of consultation in pharmacy practice. Indeed, since symptomatic therapy is the mainstay of management of this generally benign and self-limiting illness, the pharmacist is the key player in the treatment of this condition.

Unfortunately, much of the over-the-counter (OTC) therapy currently recommended throughout Europe is based on custom and practice and is not supported by clinical studies of sufficient quality to meet the standards of modern evidence-based medicine. Here we review the diagnosis and therapeutic options available for the treatment of what is perhaps the most common ailment to afflict mankind.

### Office management of the patient with chronic cough [^112oAzPy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a common complaint in the ambulatory setting and can result in significant compromise in quality of life and, uncommonly, is a presenting symptom of serious or life-threatening disease. Although there are many potential causes, an organized approach to diagnosis that may include therapeutic trials of select medications can establish the diagnosis in over 90% of presenting patients. Management hinges on accurate etiologic diagnosis. Consultation with a pulmonologist, otolaryngologist, or allergist is indicated in selected cases where diagnosis is unclear or specific therapy is mandated.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CvTe3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Variation in antibiotic prescribing and its impact on recovery in patients with acute cough in primary care: prospective study in 13 countries [^116JHx9y]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Implications for practice and research

Some interventions have been shown to successfully reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in general practice, and prescribing fewer antibiotics at the general practice level is associated with local reductions in antibiotic resistance.

We identified marked differences in whether and what antibiotics are prescribed for acute cough throughout Europe that remained after adjustment for clinical presentation based on the clinician's assessment of symptoms, duration of illness, smoking, patient's history (the presence of any comorbidities), age, and temperature.

We also found that large differences in antibiotic prescribing did not translate to clinically important differences in patients' recovery. Therefore management of acute cough is an issue that is appropriate for standardised international care pathways promoting conservative antibiotic prescribing.

### Methodology and grading of the evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116YQJ6G]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assemble a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of cough with the intention of developing clinically relevant practice guidelines for pulmonary and primary care physicians, including recommendations covering many etiologies of cough, adult and pediatric evaluation and treatment, and empiric yet integrative algorithms for the management of the patient with cough.

Methods

The Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research was selected to review and summarize the current evidence in this area. The expert panel established clinical recommendations and algorithms founded on the synthesis of this evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the approach used to develop the guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence, assessing the strength of evidence pertinent to individual guidelines, and grading the guideline recommendations.

### Assessing efficacy of therapy for cough [^112TVkqS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

An antitussive agent should reduce the amount of coughing experienced by the patient sufficiently for the patient to appreciate an improvement in cough severity and regard the improvement as sufficient to outweigh any adverse effects or risks associated with the treatment. In recent years the development of objective cough counting devices and cough-specific quality of life tools have vastly improved our ability to appropriately assess the effectiveness of anti-tussive agents and hopefully will lead to the development of safe and effective treatments in the future. This article summarizes current knowledge of methodologies available for assessing cough therapies, the patient groups to study, and the design of clinical trials.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116ZAiCJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough caused by viral respiratory tract infections is probably the most common illness to afflict mankind. Despite the widespread but ineffective prescribing of antibiotics, there is no specific therapy. Home remedies and over-the-counter medicines are the mainstay for treatment of this short-lived but debilitating condition where cough is a major troublesome symptom. Across Europe, there are large variations in the recommendations made by healthcare professionals for the treatment of acute cough. This has arisen through custom and practice based on the evidence of historical studies performed to standards well short of what would be considered legitimate today. Acute cough is particularly difficult to study in a controlled setting because of the high rate of spontaneous remission and a large placebo effect. Here we detail the validated modern methodology used to assess the efficacy of antitussives and review the drugs commonly used in Europe against these standards.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^1152Kggb]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough associated with the common cold (CACC) causes significant impairment in quality of life. Effective treatment approaches are needed for CACC. We conducted a systematic review on the management of CACC to update the recommendations and suggestions of the CHEST 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) asked the question: Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies in reducing the duration/severity of acute CACC? Studies of adults and pediatric patients with CACC were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on using the American College of Chest Physicians organization methodology.

Results

Six systematic reviews and four primary studies identified from updated literature searches for each of the reviews or from hand searching were included and reported data on 6,496 participants with CACC who received one or more of a variety of interventions. The studies used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify CACC.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of CACC is overall of low quality. This document provides treatment suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

### ERS guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in adults and children [^115sJW7x]. The European Respiratory Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to bronchodilators, ERS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering a short-term trial (2–4 weeks) of ICSs combined with long-acting bronchodilators in adult patients with chronic cough and fixed airflow obstruction.

---

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11781PdA]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline development framework — living guidelines and evidence grading states that CHEST has embarked on a model of creating living guidelines to continually update recommendations as new evidence, pharmacotherapies, or medical technologies become available and now uses a more rigorous approach to grading evidence resulting in the downgrading of much of the cough research in some clinical areas. Where there are insufficient levels of evidence to create recommendations based on a systematic search of the literature, consensus suggestions are developed and revised using a modified Delphi approach, and CHEST's consensus-based approach combined with the evidence-based model results in a hybrid process supported by both evidence and expertise. The 2006 guidelines called for an empirical integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of cough, proposed future directions for research, and defined two new terminologies: upper airway cough syndrome and unexplained cough.

### Cough mixtures: rational or irrational prescribing in hong kong? [^115pD4U2]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the extent and how cough mixtures are prescribed, and what conditions or specific groups of people would contribute to its prescription in Hong Kong.

Methods

Using diagnosis and drug data obtained from logbooks submitted by participants in the diploma in family medicine course between 1999 and 2003, we selected and analysed all patients with a diagnosis of cough or cough-related illnesses as well as cough mixtures that were used to treat them.

Results

This study confirmed that cough-related illnesses were common in the Hong Kong primary care setting and cough mixtures were used quite liberally irrespective of the patients' age and sex. Combination preparations accounted for over half of the prescriptions and cough mixture was used less in severe cases when antibiotics were given. Private doctors working in the public sector.

Conclusion

Given the current health care system, inappropriate and over-prescribing of cough mixtures can be improved by promoting health education and awareness among patients seeking medical help for this common medical condition.

### What causes cough in pulmonary fibrosis, and how should we treat it? [^111dtcnQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Cough is a frequently-occurring and often debilitating symptom for patients with ILD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and mechanistic studies, particularly into the role of cough hypersensitivity remain crucial. It remains unclear if treatment of fibrosis with the currently available antifibrotic therapies has an effect on cough; however given that they slow the rate of disease rather than resolve existing fibrosis, it is likely that any effect will be small and simply slow worsening rather than improve quality of life. The role of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory medications in the management of inflammatory ILD with associated cough remains unexplored. Therefore, the role of antitussives in improving quality of life remains a priority. The recent positive trials of opiate therapy are extremely encouraging, but require larger-scale studies in IPF and diseases other than IPF. Further trials of P2X3 are warranted given the methodological issues in the existing data. Trials of nonpharmacological measures effective in the management of CC of other causes such as speech and language therapy and physiotherapy are in development.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113axWHu]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — unexplained chronic cough (adult) management is summarized as follows: In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that unexplained chronic cough be defined as a cough that persists longer than 8 weeks, and remains unexplained after investigation, and supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that patients with chronic cough undergo a guideline/protocol based assessment process that includes objective testing for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic bronchitis, or a therapeutic corticosteroid trial (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of multimodality speech pathology therapy (Grade 2C). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids not be prescribed (Grade 2B). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of gabapentin as long as the potential side effects and the risk-benefit profile are discussed with patients before use of the medication, and there is a reassessment of the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug (Grade 2C); remarks note that patients without contraindications to gabapentin can be prescribed a dose escalation schedule beginning at 300 mg once a day with additional doses being added each day as tolerated up to a maximum tolerable daily dose of 1,800 mg a day in two divided doses. In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux disease, we suggest that proton pump inhibitor therapy not be prescribed (Grade 2C).

### Treatment of interstitial lung disease associated cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114sXBrS]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — interstitial lung disease (ILD)-associated cough recommendations are as follows: For patients with ILD who present with a troublesome cough, we suggest that patients be assessed for progression of their underlying ILD, or complications from immunosuppressive treatment and also be considered for further investigation/treatment trials for their cough according to guidelines for acute, subacute and chronic cough (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with IPF, chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux, we suggest that proton pump inhibitor therapy should not be prescribed (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed to treat the chronic cough (Grade 2C). For patients with ILD and refractory chronic cough, we suggest trials of therapies recommended for patients with unexplained chronic cough according to the CHEST guidelines, with treatments such as gabapentin and multimodality speech pathology therapy, or entering into clinical trials if available (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with chronic cough due to ILD, when alternative treatments have failed and the cough is adversely affecting their quality of life, we suggest that opiates be recommended for symptom control in a palliative care setting with reassessment of the benefits and risks at 1 week and then monthly before continuing (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Potential future therapies for the management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114r2Fjh]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

When the etiology of a patient's chronic cough is established, specific antitussive therapy that is aimed at a particular cause of cough is highly effective. Nevertheless, in certain situations, therapy with cough suppressants, which previously were classified as nonspecific antitussive therapy, and which aim at suppressing the cough reflex regardless of the cause of cough, will be necessary.

Methodology

The data for this review were obtained with the aid of a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, which was performed in June 2004, of literature published in the English language from 1966 to 2004, using the search terms "cough", "antitussive", "pharmacotherapy", "future therapies, " and "potential therapies".

Results/Conclusions

Currently available cough-suppressant therapy is severely limited by a dearth of effective agents and/or their unacceptable side effects. Several classes of pharmacologic agents are currently under investigation in an attempt to develop clinically useful cough suppressants.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^115CK7rd]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet needs in pediatric cough

Several articles in the literature review identified unmet needs in the management of pediatric cough. In terms of treatment, there is a dearth of evidence from adequately performed RCTs for the efficacy of current OTC and prescription products for acute cough. RCTs are also needed to assess treatment efficacy in different clinical settings, such as community versus hospital, and among different regions of the world. Overall, the number of therapeutic options for acute cough is limited, and there is a need for new medications that can suppress acute cough and relieve patient distress, without side effects.

Although treatment guidelines improve clinical outcomes in chronic cough, they are often based on low-quality evidence. Treatment algorithms have not been tested to see if children have different needs based on the duration and/or severity of their cough. Furthermore, the most appropriate age cutoff for the use of pediatric versus adult cough guidelines has not been determined.

Unmet needs also relate to the etiology and progression of pediatric cough. Studies are required to explore the progression of acute cough to chronic cough (current evidence suggests that clinical review is warranted when chronic cough develops following acute respiratory illness in children), the progression of chronic cough with time, and to determine the factors that predict this progression. At present, when a patient's cough does not respond to standard therapy, it can be unclear if the treatment was unsuitable, or if the etiology of cough was incorrectly discerned. There are also questions relating to the overlap of chronic cough with other conditions, such as respiratory disease. With regard to PBB, although initial research has looked into its risk factors and progression, further research is needed on its natural history, underlying disease mechanisms (factors influencing impaired pathogen clearance mechanisms), and how to optimize its treatment.

Finally, there is a need for additional studies on the clinical and psychosocial impact of cough on children and their families, and on the economic burden of cough to the individual and society.

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – expert survey

The expert survey ran from November 23 to December 21, 2020 (105 candidates identified from expert mapping) and May 24 to June 21, 2021 (217 candidates provided by the study sponsor). In total, 322 email invitations were sent out, of which 19 emails were undelivered.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

Methods

The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

Results

Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

Conclusions

The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process. Unless otherwise stated, the recommendations and suggestions meet the guidelines for trustworthiness developed by the Institute of Medicine and can be applied with confidence by physicians, nurses, other health-care providers, investigators, and patients.

### Variation in antibiotic prescribing and its impact on recovery in patients with acute cough in primary care: prospective study in 13 countries [^1111yTfa]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem worldwide, with 10% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates recorded as non-susceptible to penicillin in 30 countries in 2007. There is wide variation in antibiotic prescribing for ambulant patients in Europe. We do not know if this variation is explained by differences in presentation of illness or to which conditions it applies. Acute cough is one of the most common reasons for consulting. The proportion of European patients consulting in general practice with lower respiratory tract infection who are prescribed antibiotics ranges from about 27% in the Netherlands (for cough and bronchitis) to 75% in the United Kingdom. Trial evidence suggests that most antibiotic prescriptions do not help these patients to get better any quicker, although the datasets are sometimes small and the impact of case mix at presentation is unclear. Variation in antibiotic prescribing that does not improve outcomes for patients wastes resources, undermines self care for similar conditions in the future, puts patients at unnecessary risk of side effects, and increases selection of resistant organisms, and so represents an opportunity for improved care through greater standardisation. Higher levels of prescribing in certain settings, however, might be explained by differences in severity of illness and so variation might not always indicate inappropriate prescribing. We examined variation in antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in primary care in Europe and its impact on recovery, controlling for presentation.

### Cough. 6: which investigations are most useful in the diagnosis of chronic cough? [^116w9UxL]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

There is no consensus as to the best diagnostic strategy for chronic cough. Many protocols combine empirical trials of treatment with laboratory investigations. More precise diagnostic tools and improved therapeutic options are required. Until then, the management of chronic cough will remain a clinical challenge.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^117JktcY]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Use of appropriate cough pathways or algorithms may reduce the morbidity of chronic cough, lead to earlier diagnosis of chronic underlying illness, and reduce unnecessary costs and medications. We undertook three systematic reviews to examine three related key questions (KQ): In children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), KQ1, do cough management protocols (or algorithms) improve clinical outcomes? KQ2, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the duration and/or severity? KQ3, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. Only systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and cohort studies published in English were included.

Results

Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses flowcharts and summary tabulated. Nine studies were included in KQ1 (RCT = 1; cohort studies = 7) and eight in KQ3 (RCT = 2; cohort = 6), but none in KQ2.

Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes and cough management or the testing algorithm should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. It remains uncertain whether the management or testing algorithm should depend on the duration or severity of chronic cough. Pending new data, chronic cough in children should be defined as > 4 weeks' duration and children should be systematically evaluated with treatment targeted to the underlying cause irrespective of the cough severity.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116shMpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤ 12–18 years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8 weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤ 10–21 years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5 days to < 6 weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8 weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

### Clinical management decisions for adults with prolonged acute cough: frequency and associated factors [^117Lzfjj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated episodes of prolonged acute cough are usually viral and self-limited, but despite evidence and recommendations to the contrary, they are often treated with antibiotics.

Methods

Mixed cross-sectional and prospective observational study of adults 18 years or older presenting to two urgent care centers with a cough of 7 to 56 days as their chief complaint. Factors associated with cough duration and clinical decisions were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.

Results

Of the 125 enrolled patients, 118 (94%) received an antibiotic, 97 (78%) a cough suppressant, 87 (70%) a systemic corticosteroid, and 39 (31%) a chest X-ray (CXR). Longer duration of cough was associated with the presence of self-reported wheezing or noises (adjusted odds ratio 6.29, 95% CI 1.36–29.16) while the presence of both wheezing and crackles on a clinician chest exam was associated with shorter duration (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00–0.27). A clinician was more likely to order a CXR in patients with dyspnea (aOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.21–7.49), less likely to prescribe a systemic corticosteroid in patients with crackles (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.82), and more likely to prescribe a cough suppressant to older patients (1.04 per additional year of age, 95% CI 1.01–1.07).

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids and cough suppressants are being prescribed at high rates in patients with uncomplicated acute cough in the urgent care setting. Additional studies to determine if similar rates are seen in other urgent care centers, or in other contemporary ambulatory settings are warranted.

### Research on clinical decisions made daily in family medicine [^115DzWuA]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This issue presents research on the types of decisions that are required daily in family medicine. Patients often make these health decisions, and family physicians help patients with these decisions daily. Patients and their family physicians discuss when to quit screening for colon cancer, which treatment to choose for localized prostate cancer, when to test for pertussis when a cough is present, whether to take prescribed medications, how to complete more preventive services, and how to understand the "new genetics", and family physician use of telehealth.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^116nECM8]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnosis, guidelines agreed that acute pediatric cough (which is most commonly URTI-based) can usually be diagnosed by patient history and examination, whereas chronic pediatric cough requires systematic evaluation to identify the underlying disease. Most experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires further diagnostic investigations, and each expert listed a variety of investigations they had used in the past 6 months (most commonly spirometry, chest X-ray, and allergy testing), presumably representative of the patients that had presented at their respective clinics, and the testing that was possible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Considering the treatment of acute cough symptoms, guidelines highlighted the lack of evidence for OTC and prescription cough medicines. This was mirrored in the expert survey, where participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for different symptoms. Experts considered honey to be one of the most effective and well tolerated acute cough treatments, with some support from clinical studies. Most experts had recommended phytomedicines for the treatment of acute pediatric cough. Cough-related pain and sleep disruption were highlighted as symptoms for which current therapies are lacking. The majority of children with cough (and their parents) suffer from disturbed sleep, and there is a need for additional treatment options in this area. Experts judged that systemic steroids and immunostimulants are generally not efficacious, and are among the least well tolerated options in children, indicating a need for alternative rapid-acting treatment options. Considering chronic cough, there is greater consensus on its treatment, which involves addressing the underlying cough-causing disease.

### Help-seeking and antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in a Chinese primary care population: a prospective multicentre observational study [^113mmmyP]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Implications for future research, policy and practice

Our findings show influences on antibiotic prescribing consistent with clinicians' perception of benefit, patients' expectation, anticipation and requests in addition to presenting symptoms. A higher proportion of antibiotic prescribing by private primary care clinicians may also be evident in other health systems particularly in the Asia Pacific region where there is a mixed public and private primary care provider system. Patient and clinician factors can be further explored in relation to public and private primary care settings to develop effective interventions and tools in helping clinicians resist overbearing patient demands for appropriate use of antibiotics. The overall low usage of antibiotics may be placated by the widespread use of symptomatic medication. This needs to be further explored, as well as studies in its effectiveness for reducing cough symptoms. Meanwhile, differences in presentation and expectations to antibiotic use in the Chinese population could be further explored by comparative cross-cultural qualitative studies of patients and doctors.

Conclusions

Clinical recovery of acute cough of around 2 weeks is usual. Overall antibiotic prescribing rates were low, but there was a high rate of antibiotic prescribing among private primary care clinicians, which warrants further exploration and scope for education and intervention. Prescription of symptomatic medications was almost universal, and further exploration on cross-cultural perceptions in the role of symptomatic and antimicrobial medication, as well as the effectiveness of symptomatic medication, is warranted.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^113US1kb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cough is not standardized across the world. International experts use a variety of different guidelines, and have diverse opinions on how to define aspects of pediatric cough. Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. From an international perspective, there is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances. However, the development of such guidelines will require data gaps to be filled. In particular, clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of current acute cough therapies, and to better characterize subpopulations of pediatric patients with cough.

### Help-seeking and antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in a Chinese primary care population: a prospective multicentre observational study [^1176eRKy]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute cough is a common reason to prescribe antibiotics in primary care. This study aimed to explore help-seeking and antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in Chinese primary care population. This is a prospective multicentre observational study that included adults presenting with acute cough. Clinicians recorded patients' presenting symptoms, examination findings and medication prescription. Patients completed symptom diaries for up to 28 days by charting their symptom severity and recovery. Adjusted binary logistic regression models identified factors independently associated with antibiotic prescription. Primary care clinicians (n = 19) recruited 455 patients. A total of 321 patients (70.5%) returned their completed symptom diaries. Concern about illness severity (41.6%) and obtaining a prescription for symptomatic medications (45.9%), rather than obtaining a prescription for antibiotics, were the main reasons for consulting. Antibiotics were prescribed for 6.8% (n = 31) of patients, of which amoxicillin was the most common antimicrobial prescribed (61.3%), as it was associated with clinicians' perception of benefit from antibiotic treatment (odds ratio (OR): 25.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.7–101.1), patients' expectation for antibiotics (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.7–11.6), anticipation (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.6–15.0) and request for antibiotics (OR 15.7, 95% CI: 5.0–49.4), as well as the severity of respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, short of breath and wheeze OR: 2.7–3.7, all P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in antibiotic prescription rates between private primary care clinicians and public primary care clinicians (17.4 vs 1.6%, P = 0.00). Symptomatic medication was prescribed in 98.0% of patients. Mean recovery was 9 days for cough and 10 days for all symptoms, which was not significantly associated with antibiotic treatment. Although overall antibiotic-prescribing rates were low, there was a higher rate of antibiotic prescribing among private primary care clinicians, which warrants further exploration and scope for education and intervention.

Acute cough associated with the common cold — OTC symptomatic therapies: In adult and pediatric patients with the common cold, we find no evidence to support or refute the use of OTC antitussive agents, expectorants, mucolytic agents, antihistamines, or combination products for reducing cough, and in general the only studies identified in the reviews provided low-quality evidence to support a particular strategy for management of cough with the common cold.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^115GsoSY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with chronic cough (i.e., of more than eight weeks' duration) should include a focused history and physical examination, and in most patients, chest radiography. Patients who are taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should switch to a medication from another drug class. The most common causes of chronic cough in adults are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, alone or in combination. If upper airway cough syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed based on clinical response to empiric therapy with inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Empiric treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease should be initiated in lieu of testing for patients with chronic cough and reflux symptoms. Patients should avoid exposure to cough-evoking irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography, and referral to a pulmonologist may be indicated if the cause of chronic cough is not identified. In children, a cough lasting longer than four weeks is considered chronic. The most common causes in children are respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Evaluation of children with chronic cough should include chest radiography and spirometry.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113W7t1d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute cough in children — symptomatic therapies: For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1134dJJY]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis. For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Future directions in the clinical management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116rnN6b]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To impart a call for further research into the identified domains of particular interest in the etiology, management, and treatment of cough.

Design/Methodology

A literature review was performed using the search term "cough" in PubMed between 1983 and 2004. The final draft of this guideline was reviewed, in addition to recent studies on cough, and suggestions provided by the authors were collated into a definitive inventory of specific areas in which the lack of quality evidence encumbered the development of clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations.

Results/Conclusions

Although our understanding of the causes and optimal management of chronic cough have significantly increased over the past 25 years, further research remains to be done on this common symptom. This is reflected by the generally low level of evidence for many of the recommendations in these guidelines. Research is particularly needed on the optimal treatment of postinfectious cough, how to distinguish acute bronchitis from other conditions, how to reliably diagnose and treat cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, clearly identifying a role for nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities in diseases associated with an increased production of bronchial secretions, determining how often cough in patients with interstitial lung disease is due to conditions other than these, establishing the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in the immunocompromised hosts, and better characterizing psychogenic cough. Further studies are also needed on methods for the assessment of cough, in particular, noninvasive measures of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapy. It should be determined how often unexplained cough (previously referred to as idiopathic cough) is due to the use of non-evidence-based guidelines or to environmental causes, and assessed whether an empiric, integrative approach of diagnosing chronic cough leads to better outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, than routine testing. While much work has been done on chronic cough, we need studies on the spectrum and frequency of acute and subacute coughs.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114QUpan]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a highly prevalent symptom in children of all ages and in different regions of the world. Pediatric cough is most commonly caused by acute viral respiratory tract infection, though it can be triggered by numerous conditions including bacterial infection, allergic response, and asthma. Pediatric cough has a major impact on sleep, school performance, and the ability to play and, therefore, has a negative influence on children's quality of life. Pediatric cough is also a source of stress and anxiety for parents, due to its impact on children's behavior (e.g. refusing food) and sleep patterns, and the often unwarranted fear that it will escalate into a more serious health condition. Thus, pediatric cough is a major driver to seek medical attention, and is associated with high costs resulting from physician visits, diagnostic tests, and medications, thereby placing a high burden on healthcare systems.

Various local, national, and international organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines in order to standardize the treatment of cough in adults and/or children. However, these guidelines vary in quality, and recommendations are often based on low-quality evidence (observational studies or expert consensus, as opposed to randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Cough is a symptom of multiple diseases and, therefore, is managed by a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, while guidelines for adults outnumber those for children, adult guidelines do not translate well to children. Overall, there are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. The aims of this study were to identify and present therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients, at an international level, and to consider the clinical studies required to address these unmet needs. The aims are addressed through a review of current literature on pediatric cough, and expert opinion collected using a questionnaire.

CHEST Expert Panel — acute cough due to the common cold — issues ungraded consensus-based suggestions as follows: For adult and pediatric patients, "we suggest against the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients, "we suggest against the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years), "we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), with the remark that "Infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms". In pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), "we suggest avoiding use of codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^115j1sKh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 3, 2004); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2004); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (December 2003, http://www.update-software.com/National/nrr-frame.html). We also searched personal collections of references and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty four trials (17 in adults, seven in children) involving 3,392 people (2,876 adults and 516 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: 1. Antitussives: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two studies favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a third did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants: Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group. In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics: One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestants were significantly more effective than placebo in one of the studies, whereas the other did not show any difference between the study groups. 5. Other drug combinations: Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines: Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: 1. Antitussives: Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants: No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics: The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies showed no difference between antihistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations: One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. One study compared an antitussive/bronchodilator combination in children, which showed no difference between the treatment groups. 6. Antihistamines: In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, as identification of effective self-care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Identification of ineffective preparations could avoid costs for consumers and health care providers.

### Corticosteroids for acute and subacute cough following respiratory tract infection: a systematic review [^111XwnyB]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cough associated with acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) is one of the most common problems managed in primary care. Despite minimal evidence for the use of antibiotics, they continue to be prescribed at great cost and are a significant cause of emerging bacterial resistance.

Objectives

To carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid therapy in otherwise-healthy adults with acute RTI.

Methods

Seven electronic databases and five ongoing trial registers were searched. Studies were eligible if they compared the use of any corticosteroid treatment against a control group in adults with an acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (< 8 weeks) cough associated with an RTI but no asthma. Primary outcomes were differences in mean cough and other symptom scores. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, subsequent diagnosis of asthma and patient satisfaction.

Results

Four trials (335 participants) investigating the effects of inhaled corticosteroids were identified. None investigated the use of oral corticosteroids. Results were mixed, with two reporting equivalence and two reporting benefits for mean cough score (P = 0.012) and cough frequency (P = 0.047). One reported additional benefits in non-smokers. Adverse events were rare and there were no data on patient satisfaction or the subsequent diagnosis of asthma. Most trials were of unclear risk of bias. Study outcomes were too heterogeneous to meta-analyse.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids for acute RTI in adults. However, some trials have shown benefits, suggesting the need for further high-quality, adequately powered trials.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116iPnBu]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) diagnosis — UCC is defined as a chronic cough that persists after comprehensive investigation, medical assessment, and optimal trials of indicated therapy in an adherent patient, with key elements being requirements for adequate assessment, investigation, and therapy. Assessment completeness is recognized as following the five areas of intervention fidelity (study design, training of providers, delivery of treatment, receipt, and enactment of treatment), and there is a need to consistently use validated outcome assessment tools when evaluating treatment response in chronic cough. Intervention fidelity bias was identified in studies of ICS for unexplained chronic cough; the recommendation is that asthma, allergy, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis be objectively assessed before making a diagnosis of UCC, and if a protocol-based clinical trial of ICS yields no improvement, the recommendation is not to treat with ICS; when this method was followed, ICS were shown to be ineffective in the treatment of UCC.

### Cough medicines for children-time for a reality check [^115ZSRQV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cough medicines have been in use for over a century to treat the common and troublesome, but often helpful, symptoms of cough in children. They contain various combinations of "anti-tussive" drugs including opioids, antihistamines, herbal preparations, mucolytics, decongestants and expectorants. Whilst theoretically attractive for symptom relief when children are suffering, as time has passed these popular over the counter medicines have been shown to lack efficacy, delay more serious underlying diagnoses, and can cause complications and sometimes death. This has resulted in clinician concerns, a citizen petition to the American Food and Drug Association in 2007, some self-regulation from manufacturers and escalating restrictions on their use from regulatory agencies across the world over the last twenty years. This article will review the protective role of cough, juxtapose the conflicting treatment goals of suppressing a dry cough and promoting expectoration for a wet cough, consider the evidence basis for prescribing cough medicines in comparison to other more specific treatments such as for asthma [beta agonists] or infection [antibiotics], regulatory interventions, and conclude with the view that over counter cough medicines should not be used in children, especially young children.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### A decision aid to rule out pneumonia and reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics in primary care patients with cough and fever [^112Wv9Rb]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians fear missing cases of pneumonia and treat many patients with signs of respiratory infection unnecessarily with antibiotics. This is an avoidable cause for the increasing worldwide problem of antibiotic resistance. We developed a user-friendly decision aid to rule out pneumonia and thus reduce the rate of needless prescriptions of antibiotics.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study in which we enrolled patients older than 18 years with a new or worsened cough and fever without serious co-morbidities. Physicians recorded results of a standardized medical history and physical examination. C-reactive protein was measured and chest radiographs were obtained. We used Classification and Regression Trees to derive the decision tool.

Results

A total of 621 consenting eligible patients were studied, 598 were attending a primary care facility, were 48 years on average and 50% were male. Radiographic signs for pneumonia were present in 127 (20.5%) of patients. Antibiotics were prescribed to 234 (48.3%) of patients without pneumonia. In patients with C-reactive protein values below 10 μg/ml or patients presenting with C-reactive protein between 11 and 50 μg/ml, but without dyspnoea and daily fever, pneumonia can be ruled out. By applying this rule in clinical practice antibiotic prescription could be reduced by 9.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4 to 11.8).

Conclusions

Following validation and confirmation in new patient samples, this tool could help rule out pneumonia and be used to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients presenting with cough and fever in primary care. The algorithm might be especially useful in those instances where taking a medical history and physical examination alone are inconclusive for ruling out pneumonia

### Antibiotic prescription strategies and adverse outcome for uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections: prospective cough complication cohort (3C) study [^113GbtsR]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

As far as we are aware this is one of the very few prospective clinical cohorts with sufficient power to address the impact of antibiotic prescribing strategies on subsequent major adverse outcomes. Even in a cohort of 30 000 participants, it was not possible to show that either immediate or delayed antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction in subsequent hospital admission or death. Non-resolving symptoms or progression of the illness with new symptoms was common, and a delayed prescription but not immediate antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction in reconsultations with such symptoms.

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113PXK7i]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cough among patients with lung cancer is a common but often undertreated symptom. We used a 2015 Cochrane systematic review, among other sources of evidence, to update the recommendations and suggestions of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

The CHEST methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on data from the Cochrane systematic review on the topic, uncontrolled studies, case studies, and the clinical context. Final grading was reached by consensus according to the Delphi method.

Results

The Cochrane systematic review identified 17 trials of primarily low-quality evidence. Such evidence was related to both nonpharmacologic (cough suppression) and pharmacologic (demulcents, opioids, peripherally acting antitussives, or local anesthetics) treatments, as well as endobronchial brachytherapy.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 CHEST Cough Guideline, the current recommendations and suggestions are more specific and follow a step-up approach to the management of cough among patients with lung cancer, acknowledging the low-quality evidence in the field and the urgent need to develop more effective, evidence-based interventions through high-quality research.

### Causes of chronic productive cough: an approach to management [^117T5Gvx]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A chronic 'productive' or 'wet' cough is a common presenting complaint for patients attending the adult respiratory clinic. Most reviews and guidelines suggest that the causes of a productive cough are the same as those of a non-productive cough and as such the same diagnostic pathway should be followed. We suggest a different diagnostic approach for patients with a productive cough, focussing on the conditions that are the most likely causes of this problem. This review is intended to briefly summarise the epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of a number of conditions which are often associated with chronic productive cough to aid decision making when encountering a patient with this often distressing symptom. The conditions discussed include bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis and immunodeficiency. We also propose an adult version of the paediatric diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in patients with idiopathic chronic productive cough who appear to respond well to low dose macrolide therapy.

Grading recommendations — The recommendation grading includes a strength dimension and in practice "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies only to some patients". The strength of recommendation here is "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations". Intervention fidelity is emphasized and is defined "as the extent to which an intervention was delivered as conceived and planned-to arrive at valid conclusions concerning its effectiveness in achieving target outcomes".

### Cough: diagnosis and management… [^1154pf7d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

If the cough is due to the common cold, a first-generation antihistamine plus a decongestant should be prescribed. It has been shown that naproxen favorably affects cough. Newer-generation nonsedating antihistamines are not effective for reducing cough. Patients must be symptomatic for a least one week before a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is made, because prior to that point bacterial overgrowth is unlikely. Subacute Cough The first step in diagnosing subacute cough is to determine whether the cough has followed a respiratory infection. If the cough does not appear to be postinfectious, it should be managed as if it were a chronic cough. Patients suspected of being infected with B. pertussis should have a nasopharyngeal swab for culture. Patients with confirmed whooping cough should receive macrolide antibiotics and should be isolated for five days beginning on the first day of treatment. If the cough is not caused by bacterial sinusitis or.

Bordetella pertussis, treatment with inhaled ipratropium should be initiated to attenuate the cough. If the cough persists, consider the use of inhaled corticosteroids. If the cough is severe, consider prescribing 30 to 40 mg of prednisone per day for a brief period. When other treatments fail, codeine or dextromethorphan should be considered. UPPER AIRWAY COUGH SYNDROME–INDUCED CHRONIC COUGH Patients with chronic cough should first be treated with a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant. If the patient has complete or partial resolution of cough after one to two weeks of antihistamine/decongestant therapy, then it is assumed that upper airway cough syndrome was the cause and therapy should be continued. If the patient has persistent nasal symptoms, it is appropriate to begin a topical nasal steroid. If symptoms still persist, it is an indication for sinus imaging.

In patients who do not respond or cannot take inhaled medication, treatment with oral corticosteroids for five to 10 days is an option. Because oral leukotriene inhibitors may be effective, consideration should be given to adding a leukotriene inhibitor before an oral corticosteroid. If treatment for upper airway cough syndrome and asthma have both failed, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis should be considered next.

### Guidelines for treating adults with acute cough… [^116fEyFX]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

This editorial highlights key recommendations for treating adult patients with acute cough. Figure 1 2 is an algorithm for the management of acute cough |When cough is caused by the common cold, older anti-histamine/decongestant medications and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen are likely to be helpful; newer nonsedating antihistamines and over-the-counter combination cough medications are not likely to be helpful; antibiotics are not indicated |.

By using the most rigorous and current methods to develop its evidence-based clinical practice guideline for acute cough, the ACCP guideline committee made diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on two components: the quality of the evidence, which was rated according to study design and strength of the modalities used; and the net benefit of the recommendation based on the estimated benefit to the specific patient population. 4 Using this process, the committee's recommendations are stronger than Simasek and Blandino's, 1 who based their recommendations on Cochrane reviews. The committee strongly recommends that patients with acute cough from the common cold receive a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen unless there is a contraindication. Antibiotics are rarely effective for acute cough and are not indicated for acute cough from the common cold, acute bronchitis, asthma, mild exacerbations of chronic bronchitis related to smoking, or environmental irritants. On the other hand, antibiotics are likely to be effective for conditions such as pneumonia, upper airway cough syndrome from bacterial sinusitis,… Bordetella pertussis infection in the lower respiratory tract, if given early in the illness, and for exacerbations of bronchiectasis and severe chronic bronchitis in current or previous smokers with severe airflow obstruction. 2 A history, physical examination, and selected diagnostic testing can help physicians accurately diagnose patients who will likely benefit from antibiotics.

For example, cough will be at its worst during the first few days of a common cold when it is caused by an uncomplicated viral infection and will gradually and progressively improve over the next week or two.

### Should you give kids medicine for coughs and colds? [^114WR9cu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, some cough and cold medicines can have serious side effects, such as slowed breathing, which can be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children. For those reasons, it's important to know when your child needs medication, which treatments are recommended, and when to do without medicine. These days, cold and cough symptoms can be especially worrisome, because they could be symptoms of COVID-19, the flu, or other potentially serious illness. If you are concerned about COVID-19, talk to your child's health care provider. A makes breathing easier by decreasing congestion in nasal passages. Do not use warm mist humidifiers because they can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult. cool mist humidifier keep nasal passages moist and help avoid stuffiness. Saline nose drops or sprays or a similar product, with or without saline nose drops, works very well for children younger than a year old.

You can use them on older children, too, but they often resist bulb syringes. Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe. can be used to reduce fever, aches, and pain. Carefully read and follow the product's instructions on the Drug Facts label or talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about dosage. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen Encourage children to drink plenty of liquids to. stay hydrated. Giving Children Cough and Cold Medicines Over-the-counter medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms. The FDA doesn't recommend OTC medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 because they could cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products to state: "Do not use in children under 4 years of age".
- A fever of 100. 4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in an infant 2 months or younger.
- A fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in children at any age.
- Blue lips.
- Labored breathing, including nostrils widening with each breath; wheezing; fast breathing; the ribs showing with each breath; or shortness of breath.
- Severe headache.
- Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration.
- Excessive crankiness or sleepiness.
- Persistent ear pain.
- If the child is getting worse.

### Taming cough in the peds world… [^116hWg5C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ACCP Pediatric cough guidelines 2006
- OTC Cough Medications Systematic reviews have concluded that OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in the symptomatic control of acute cough in children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has advised against the use of codeine and dextromethorphan for treating any type of cough. ACCP Pediatric cough guidelines 2006
- For acute cough, a systematic review of antihistamine and nasal decongestion combinations and antihistamines in OTC medication has shown that these pharmaceuticals were no more likely than placebo to reduce acute cough in children. Schroeder Arch Dis Child 2002; 86: 170–175.

GERD and Cough
- **Utility of prokinetic agents**:

- 56 patients with GERD related cough treated with PPI BID
- 24 responded
- 18 others only responded with addition of prokinetic agent
- Presumed to be a result of nonacid refluxate causing cough
- This study also reinforces the utility of empiric Rx as 44 or 56 responded without endoscopy or pH probe Poe Chest 2003; 123: 679–84 Ours Am J Gastro 1999; 94: 3131–8. Rank Ann All 2007; 98: 305–13 Chronic Cough
- Peds
- Currently, the ACCP and ERS guidelines define a chronic cough in adults as one that persists greater then 8 wks.
- However, ACCP and ERS differ in their definition for children
- ACCP requiring 4 weeks duration
- ERS using the same length of 8 weeks as required in the. adult criteria.
- The ACCP chose four weeks as the cut off as URTI, a common cause for a prolonged cough, generally resolve within 1–3 weeks in most children. Chest 2006; 129: 260S-83S Eur Respir J 2004; 24: 481–92.
