## Question

A 54-year-old man with a BMI of 44 kg/m² is admitted to the hospital with acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. He has a history of loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, and poorly controlled hypertension. Arterial blood gas on room air shows pH 7.33, PaCO₂ 62 mmHg, and PaO₂ 58 mmHg. After initial stabilization with supplemental oxygen and diuretics, he is improving but still requires oxygen. The team suspects obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) as the underlying cause. The patient is nearing hospital discharge, but a formal sleep study and positive airway pressure titration cannot be arranged until after discharge.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended approach to positive airway pressure therapy for this patient at the time of hospital discharge?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to positive airway pressure therapy for a 54-year-old man with suspected obesity hypoventilation syndrome who is being discharged from the hospital before a formal sleep study and titration can be arranged. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of OHS and why the inpatient context matters. Then, I should verify what the ATS guideline says about discharge management when OHS is suspected but not yet confirmed. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting empiric NIV at discharge and the timing of outpatient workup. After that, I need to consider practical empiric NIV settings and alternatives if NIV is not available. Finally, I should outline follow-up, monitoring, and when to switch modalities once the sleep study is completed, while double-checking for any exceptions or caveats that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and why OHS is suspected. The patient has obesity with BMI 44 kg/m², awake hypercapnia with PaCO2 62 mmHg, and features of sleep-disordered breathing, which meets the diagnostic triad for OHS after excluding other causes, and the acute-on-chronic presentation with pH 7.33 indicates decompensated chronic ventilatory failure, placing him at high risk for recurrence if untreated [^cfb00e8e] [^9d7f2861].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on discharge before formal sleep testing. The ATS 2019 OHS guideline explicitly recommends that hospitalized patients with respiratory failure suspected of having OHS be discharged on noninvasive ventilation until they can complete outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration, ideally within 2–3 months, and this is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty evidence, which still reflects consensus given the risk of untreated OHS [^a0a548eb] [^4137b116] [^c15bc160].

> I should confirm the rationale and magnitude of benefit. Observational cohort data summarized in the guideline show that patients discharged without PAP had markedly higher 3‑month mortality than those discharged on PAP, with adjusted odds of death about sixfold higher without PAP, and although the evidence is observational and at serious risk of bias, the panel judged the potential harm of no PAP to outweigh the uncertainties, supporting empiric NIV at discharge [^5f73cc00].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality. I initially thought CPAP might be fine to send home because many OHS patients have coexisting severe OSA, and indeed in stable ambulatory OHS with severe OSA, CPAP is reasonable first-line; however, wait, I should verify the inpatient context here. The ATS discharge recommendation specifically favors NIV for hospitalized patients with suspected OHS and ongoing hypercapnia, because NIV provides ventilatory support and is more likely to stabilize gas exchange while awaiting definitive titration, whereas CPAP alone may be insufficient in acute or decompensated OHS even if OSA coexists [^a0a548eb] [^73797ff5] [^65a65f95].

> Next, I should review practical empiric NIV settings and mask choice. Let me think about what is reasonable to start with in the absence of a titration study. Common practice is to use bilevel PAP with an initial IPAP around 12–16 cm H2O and EPAP around 6–8 cm H2O, titrating to improve ventilation and oxygenation while watching for mask leak and comfort; full-face masks are often preferred in acute settings to minimize leak and maximize delivered pressures, and many patients with OHS ultimately require relatively high IPAP and EPAP to unload the respiratory muscles and restore lung volumes, with some needing volume-assured modes if pressure alone is inadequate [^cfd53f89] [^7f3bdd35].

> I need to ensure we address oxygenation. The patient still needs oxygen at discharge, which is not uncommon in OHS; supplemental oxygen can be layered onto NIV when hypoxemia persists despite adequate ventilatory support, but I should double-check that we are not masking ventilatory control issues. The ATS notes that oxygen may be added as needed, and while some data suggest limited standalone benefit of oxygen without PAP, in the context of NIV it is reasonable to titrate oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% while monitoring for CO2 retention and morning confusion, with close follow-up to wean oxygen as ventilation improves [^d35a598a] [^6b8eba50].

> But wait, what if NIV is not available or the patient cannot tolerate a full-face mask. The guideline remarks that if NIV is not feasible, auto-PAP may be preferable to no PAP, recognizing that about 70% of OHS patients have severe OSA and may respond to CPAP, albeit with slower correction of hypercapnia and a need for vigilant early follow-up; I should confirm that this fallback does not replace the need for a sleep study and that we plan timely reassessment of gas exchange and symptoms if we use CPAP empirically [^9a9e4f34] [^73797ff5].

> I will now examine the outpatient plan and timing. The ATS recommends arranging outpatient diagnostic sleep testing and PAP titration as early as possible, ideally within 2–3 months, and explicitly states that discharging on NIV should not substitute for arranging that workup; I should confirm that we have a sleep clinic referral in place and a plan for early follow-up to reassess adherence, mask/interface issues, and physiologic response, including repeat ABG or transcutaneous CO2 if symptoms or oxygen needs persist [^a0a548eb] [^6b8eba50].

> Let me consider what happens after the sleep study. If the study shows OHS with severe OSA, CPAP is generally preferred long term for stable patients, whereas if there is OHS without severe OSA or if CPAP fails to normalize hypercapnia after 6–8 weeks of adherent therapy, we should switch to NIV; I should double-check that we communicate this contingency plan up front so expectations and logistics are clear [^925e54bd] [^f20622e3].

> I should confirm that we are not overlooking other contributors to hypercapnia. OHS is a diagnosis of exclusion, so we need to ensure there is no significant COPD, neuromuscular disease, or severe restrictive lung disease, and we should screen for pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain given its frequency in OHS; this affects both prognosis and the urgency of definitive PAP therapy and weight-loss planning [^cfb00e8e] [^9d7f2861].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: discharge the patient on empiric noninvasive ventilation with bilevel PAP using reasonable starting pressures and a full-face mask, add supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate saturation, arrange urgent outpatient sleep testing and PAP titration within 2–3 months, and schedule early follow-up to assess adherence, gas exchange, and symptoms; if NIV is not feasible, consider auto-CPAP as a bridge with close monitoring, but do not delay the definitive sleep evaluation and titration [^a0a548eb] [^4137b116] [^cfd53f89] [^6b8eba50].

The recommended approach is to **discharge on empiric noninvasive ventilation (NIV)** [^a0a548eb] with bilevel PAP settings (e.g. IPAP 12–16 cm H2O, EPAP 6–8 cm H2O) [^7f3bdd35] and add supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^notfound]. This bridging strategy is supported by ATS 2019 guidelines [^a0a548eb] and reduces short-term mortality [^5f73cc00] while awaiting outpatient polysomnography and PAP titration within 2–3 months [^a0a548eb]. If NIV is unavailable, **auto-CPAP is an acceptable alternative** [^9a9e4f34], but NIV is preferred given the patient's hypercapnia and severity [^5f73cc00]. Arrange close follow-up to monitor adherence, gas exchange, and symptoms, and adjust therapy once the sleep study is completed [^6b8eba50].

---

## Rationale for empiric positive airway pressure therapy

Patients with suspected OHS who are discharged without PAP have **significantly higher 3-month mortality** than those discharged on PAP (16.8% vs 2.3%; adjusted OR 0.16) [^5f73cc00]. Empiric NIV at discharge is therefore recommended to mitigate this risk while definitive diagnostic testing is arranged [^a0a548eb].

---

## Choice of positive airway pressure modality

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Preferred for hospitalized patients with suspected OHS and hypercapnic respiratory failure [^a0a548eb] because it provides ventilatory support and improves gas exchange [^ad137208].

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: Consider if NIV is unavailable or not tolerated; however, CPAP alone may be less effective in correcting hypoventilation in severe OHS [^9a9e4f34] [^762f1c9c].

- **Auto-CPAP**: An alternative when NIV is not feasible, but NIV remains the preferred initial modality in this context [^9a9e4f34].

---

## Recommended empiric NIV settings

Empiric NIV settings should be individualized, but **typical starting parameters** include:

| **Parameter** | **Recommended setting** |
|-|-|
| IPAP | 12–16 cm H2O |
| EPAP | 6–8 cm H2O |
| Backup rate | 10–12 breaths/min (if available) |
| Tidal volume target | 8–10 mL/kg ideal body weight (if available) |

---

These settings should be titrated to achieve adequate ventilation, reduce hypercapnia, and improve oxygenation, with **close monitoring of patient tolerance and adherence** [^6b8eba50].

---

## Role of supplemental oxygen

Supplemental oxygen should be added to maintain **SpO2 ≥ 90%** during NIV, as many patients with OHS have concurrent hypoxemia. Oxygen should be titrated carefully to avoid worsening hypercapnia [^d35a598a].

---

## Importance of outpatient follow-up and diagnostic confirmation

Outpatient polysomnography and PAP titration should be arranged within **2–3 months** of discharge to confirm the diagnosis and optimize therapy [^a0a548eb]. Early follow-up (within 4–8 weeks) is essential to assess adherence, symptom control, and gas exchange, and to adjust settings as needed [^6b8eba50].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of empiric PAP therapy

Benefits include improved gas exchange, reduced symptoms, and lower short-term mortality [^5f73cc00]; risks include mask discomfort, aerophagia, and **pressure-related complications**, which can be mitigated with patient education, mask fitting, and careful titration [^6b8eba50].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Discharge on empiric NIV** with bilevel PAP settings and add supplemental oxygen as needed [^a0a548eb].

- **Arrange outpatient polysomnography and PAP titration within 2–3 months** [^a0a548eb].

- **Schedule early follow-up** to monitor adherence and response, and adjust therapy accordingly [^6b8eba50].

- **Use NIV as first-line therapy**; consider CPAP or auto-CPAP only if NIV is unavailable or not tolerated [^9a9e4f34].

---

Empiric NIV at discharge is the **preferred approach** for patients with suspected OHS and hypercapnic respiratory failure who cannot undergo immediate sleep testing, balancing short-term mortality benefit against the need for timely diagnostic confirmation and therapy optimization.

Background: The purpose of this guideline is to optimize evaluation and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified and prioritized five clinical questions. The panel performed systematic reviews of available studies (up to July 2018) and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations. All panel members discussed and approved the recommendations. Recommendations: After considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that: 1) clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS, 2) stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP), 3) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea, 4) patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo), and 5) patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery). Conclusions: Clinicians may use these recommendations, on the basis of the best available evidence, to guide management and improve outcomes among patients with OHS.

American Thoracic Society guideline — hospital discharge management for suspected obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): We suggest that hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS be started on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy before being discharged and continued on NIV until they undergo outpatient workup and titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in the sleep laboratory, ideally during the first 3 months after hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). Remarks add that clinicians may discharge patients on the same NIV settings used during hospitalization, the panel could not recommend empiric settings for NIV, in settings where NIV is not available discharging patients on auto-PAP is preferable to no PAP, and discharge on NIV or auto-PAP should not substitute for arranging an outpatient sleep study to appropriately titrate PAP therapy.

### Erratum: evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^29c1b958]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There is an error in the ATS clinical practice guidelines published in the August 1, 2019, issue of the Journal. The ATS recommendations in response to Question 4 ("Should hospitalized adults suspected of having OHS, in whom the diagnosis has not yet been made, be discharged from the hospital with or without PAP treatment until the diagnosis of OHS is either confirmed or ruled out?") should begin with the words "We suggest." This correction should have been made to page e17 of the full document and page 287 of the Executive Summary. Table 1 in both documents does include the correct wording.

The full recommendation should read:

We suggest that hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS be started on NIV therapy before being discharged from the hospital and continued on NIV therapy until they undergo outpatient workup and titration of PAP therapy in the sleep laboratory, ideally during the first 3 months after hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence).

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^5f73cc00]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — Hospital discharge management for suspected obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) prior to diagnostic confirmation: In observational cohorts of hospitalized patients with OHS or suspected OHS who survived to discharge, 1,269 were analyzed, of whom 119 (10%) were discharged without positive airway pressure (PAP) and 1,043 (90%) on PAP; those discharged without PAP were older (73 ± 10 yr vs. 64 ± 13 yr), had higher baseline Paco2 (78.4 ± 18 mm Hg vs. 62.2 ± 16 mm Hg), and were more often female (41% vs. 5%), with data missing at high rates. Three‑month mortality was higher without PAP (20/119; 16.8%; 95% CI, 10.6–24.8%) than with PAP (24/1,043; 2.3%; 95% CI, 1.5–3.3%; P < 0.0001), and after adjustment the odds of death were lower with PAP (adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08–0.33; P < 0.0001). In a subgroup with arterial blood gases available (n = 100 without PAP; n = 228 with PAP), 3‑month mortality was 9.0% versus 4.4% (P = 0.085) with an adjusted OR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.19–1.24) and an estimated risk difference of 44 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients (95% CI from 72 fewer to 19 more). The evidence is observational with no randomized trials and is at serious risk of bias with very low certainty. Importantly, the great majority of patients (92%) in these studies were discharged on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) rather than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and in some settings patients discharged on NIV may be switched to CPAP after the sleep study. Based on panel judgment, NIV should be considered the treatment of choice until further evaluation is performed with subsequent sleep studies.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^f20622e3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — positive airway pressure management in obesity hypoventilation syndrome specifies that the panel recommends continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration and treatment, and if the sleep study demonstrates OHS with no obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or mild to moderate OSA, the panel recommends noninvasive ventilation (NIV) titration and treatment; in patients initially treated with CPAP who do not have adequate response to therapy, the panel recommends changing to NIV therapy. The panel also recommends that patients with OHS should be considered for bariatric surgery, and states that all recommendations are conditional because of the very low level of certainty in the evidence. In healthcare settings with limited or no access to NIV, discharging patients on auto-PAP would be preferable to no PAP, particularly given that 70% of patients with OHS have coexistent severe OSA, and the text emphasizes that OHS is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring other causes of hypercapnia to be investigated and excluded.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ATS guideline) — conditional recommendations and monitoring: The guideline includes conditional recommendations for using serum bicarbonate below 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) in the appropriate clinical context; treating patients with positive airway pressure (PAP); favoring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for the approximately two-thirds of patients who have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); discharging hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS on PAP while they await subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic workup; and risk-stratifying patients for bariatric surgery interventions. For PAP titration or subsequent PAP adjustment, noninvasive monitoring of ventilation (transcutaneous CO2) can be added to pulse oximetry (SpO2), but we found no studies that examined outcomes using monitoring of SpO2 versus combined SpO2 plus noninvasive monitoring of CO2, and we propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for patients with OHS or suspected of having OHS.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — positive airway pressure (PAP) versus no PAP in stable ambulatory patients: For stable ambulatory patients diagnosed with OHS, we suggest treatment with PAP during sleep (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). Patients with symptomatic OHS who have significant comorbidities and those with chronic respiratory failure after an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure may particularly benefit from using PAP.

American Thoracic Society obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) outpatient evaluation — Ambulatory stable obese patient with suspected OHS: in the outpatient setting, the panel recommends performing a measurement of arterial blood gases (ABG) to confirm daytime hypercapnia for patients with high pretest probability of OHS (for example, very symptomatic patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2) and assessing serum bicarbonate for moderate or low pretest probability (for example, a BMI of 30–40 kg/m2). When the bicarbonate level is ≥ 27 mmol/l, the panel recommends a confirmatory ABG and a sleep study; if the serum bicarbonate level is < 27 mmol/L, OHS is highly unlikely, after which sleep study/PAP titration follows when hypercapnia is confirmed.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — choice of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus noninvasive ventilation (NIV): For stable ambulatory patients diagnosed with OHS and concomitant severe OSA (apnea–hypopnea index ≥ 30 events/h), we suggest initiating first-line treatment with CPAP therapy rather than NIV (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). More than 70% of patients with OHS also have severe OSA; therefore, this recommendation applies to the majority of patients with OHS who have concomitant severe OSA, and panel members lacked certainty on the clinical benefits of initiating CPAP rather than NIV in patients with OHS who have sleep hypoventilation without severe OSA.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) management in OHS — PAP has become the primary management option for controlling sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and reversing awake hypoventilation in OHS; the most commonly prescribed modalities are noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or continuous PAP (CPAP), where NIV applies positive-pressure ventilation, usually with bilevel PAP settings with or without a backup respiratory rate or a volume-targeted pressure support mode that delivers a preset target volume and includes backup respiratory rate; despite effective therapies, most patients with OHS remain undiagnosed and untreated until late when they present to high-acuity settings with acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure or escalated ambulatory care to pulmonary or sleep specialists.

American Thoracic Society guideline recommendation — initial positive airway pressure (PAP) modality in stable ambulatory adults with OHS and severe OSA: The panel states, "we suggest CPAP rather than NIV be used as the initial treatment" for patients with concurrent severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/h) presenting with chronic stable respiratory failure, noting that " > 70% of patients with OHS have severe OSA," so the recommendation applies to most, but with "less certainty" in those without severe OSA; this is a "conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence." Remarks emphasize that improvements in awake hypercapnia "may be achieved more slowly with CPAP," that response variability "requires close monitoring… especially during the first 2 months of treatment," and that adherence is similar at "5 to 6 h/night." The panel also notes an RCT in which long‑term CPAP was associated with lower cost than NIV and that NIV "may require more resources for titration and equipment training."

American Thoracic Society obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) definition and diagnostic evaluation — OHS is defined by obesity with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and awake daytime hypercapnia with awake resting PaCO2 ≥ 45 mm Hg at sea level after excluding other causes; polysomnography or sleep respiratory polygraphy is required to determine the pattern of SDB and hypoventilation, tailor treatment, and establish optimal positive airway pressure (PAP) settings.

PAP initiation and follow-up in OHS — titration, monitoring, and adherence: The consensus opinion is that PAP should be titrated based on the individual's overnight respiratory monitoring, with, as a minimum, overnight monitoring including continuous oximetry; the use of only empiric settings for initial PAP in patients with OHS without guidance of overnight physiological assessment is not ideal. Once PAP treatment is established, patients should receive standardized education and training with early (4–8 wk) follow-up to assess clinical and physiological response, and follow-up should include monitoring objective adherence because higher rates of adherence to PAP are associated with superior control of respiratory failure in OHS. Among patients with eucapnic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), telemonitoring and educational support have improved adherence to PAP, but no such data exist in OHS; guidance on the use of ventilator-derived data in eucapnic OSA on PAP can be reasonably extrapolated to OHS.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) for adults with obesity hypoventilation syndrome — evidence summary reports that across 31 studies (27 single-arm case series, 2 observational with control, 3 randomized controlled trials), deaths were rare over short follow-up (PAP, 0 of 209; no PAP, 0 of 205; 1–2 mo). Pooled randomized data showed improvements in daytime respiratory failure with PAP, including mean difference in awake PaO2 of 3.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.5–5.5 mm Hg) and awake PaCO2 of − 2.4 mm Hg (95% CI, − 1.0 to − 3.8 mm Hg). With PAP, 90% achieved an awake PaO2 greater than 55 mm Hg versus 78.3% without PAP; using this clinical threshold, 13 fewer patients per 100 treated with PAP (95% CI, 3 fewer to 23 fewer) would require supplemental oxygen during wakefulness. Health-related quality measures improved, with Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire mean difference 6.6 (95% CI, 2.5 to 10.7) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale improvement −2.5 (95% CI, −1.0 to −4.0). Short-term rates of hospitalization were reduced by PAP, but the event rate was low and data were reported in only one RCT.

How to use these guidelines — application and limits: These guidelines provide a basis for rational, informed decision-making by all healthcare professionals who care for obese adults and patients with OSA, but stakeholders should not treat the recommendations in these guidelines as binding mandates; consideration can take into account variable and often compelling circumstances that might affect the potential benefits, harms, and burdens of an intervention in specific cases and contexts, and no one charged with overseeing or evaluating actions of clinicians or other stakeholders should apply the recommendations from these guidelines in a blanket fashion without an understanding of the individual patient.

### Long-term clinical effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy versus non-invasive ventilation therapy in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^ab58dfd4]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is commonly treated with continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation during sleep. Non-invasive ventilation is more complex and costly than continuous positive airway pressure but might be advantageous because it provides ventilatory support. To date there have been no long-term trials comparing these treatment modalities. We therefore aimed to determine the long-term comparative effectiveness of both treatment modalities.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 16 clinical sites in Spain. We included patients aged 15–80 years with untreated obesity hypoventilation syndrome and an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 30 or more events per h. We randomly assigned patients, using simple randomisation through an electronic database, to receive treatment with either non-invasive ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure. Both investigators and patients were aware of the treatment allocation. The research team was not involved in deciding hospital treatment, duration of treatment in the hospital, and adjustment of medications, as well as adjudicating cardiovascular events or cause of mortality. Treating clinicians from the routine care team were not aware of the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the number of hospitalisation days per year. The analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01405976.

Findings

From May 4, 2009, to March 25, 2013, 100 patients were randomly assigned to the non-invasive ventilation group and 115 to the continuous positive airway pressure group, of which 97 patients in the non-invasive ventilation group and 107 in the continuous positive airway pressure group were included in the analysis. The median follow-up was 5·44 years (IQR 4·45–6·37) for all patients, 5·37 years (4·36–6·32) in the continuous positive airway pressure group, and 5·55 years (4·53–6·50) in the non-invasive ventilation group. The mean hospitalisation days per patient-year were 1·63 (SD 3·74) in the continuous positive airway pressure group and 1·44 (3·07) in the non-invasive ventilation group (adjusted rate ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·34–1·77; p = 0·561). Adverse events were similar between both groups.

Interpretation

In stable patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and severe obstructive sleep apnoea, non-invasive ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure have similar long-term effectiveness. Given that continuous positive airway pressure has lower complexity and cost, continuous positive airway pressure might be the preferred first-line positive airway pressure treatment modality until more studies become available.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: mechanisms and management [^c5226a02]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome describes the association between obesity and the development of chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation. This syndrome arises from a complex interaction between sleep-disordered breathing, diminished respiratory drive, and obesity-related respiratory impairment, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therapy directed toward reversing these abnormalities leads to improved daytime breathing, with available treatment options including positive pressure therapy, weight loss, and pharmacological management. However, a lack of large-scale, well-designed studies evaluating these various therapies has limited the development of evidence-based treatment recommendations. Although treatment directed toward improving sleep-disordered breathing is usually effective, not all patients tolerate mask ventilation and awake hypercapnia may persist despite effective use. In the longer term, weight loss is desirable, but data on the success and sustainability of this approach in obesity hypoventilation are lacking. The review outlines the major mechanisms believed to underlie the development of hypoventilation in this subgroup of obese patients, their clinical presentation, and current therapy options.

### Optimal NIV Medicare access promotion: patients with hypoventilation syndromes: a technical expert panel report from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Association for Respiratory Care, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American Thoracic Society [^2dee2039]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

The existing coverage criteria for home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) do not recognize the diversity of hypoventilation syndromes and advances in technologies. This document summarizes the work of the hypoventilation syndromes Technical Expert Panel working group. The most pressing current coverage barriers identified were: (1) overreliance on arterial blood gases (particularly during sleep); (2) need to perform testing on prescribed oxygen; (3) requiring a sleep study to rule out OSA as the cause of sustained hypoxemia; (4) need for spirometry; (5) need to show bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) without a backup rate failure to qualify for BPAP spontaneous/timed; and (6) qualifying hospitalized patients for home NIV therapy at the time of discharge. Critical evidence support for changes to current policies includes randomized controlled trial evidence and clinical practice guidelines. To decrease morbidity and mortality by achieving timely access to NIV for patients with hypoventilation, particularly those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, we make the following key suggestions: (1) given the significant technological advances, we advise acceptance of surrogate noninvasive end-tidal and transcutaneous Pco 2 and venous blood gases in lieu of arterial blood gases; (2) not requiring Pco 2 measures while on prescribed oxygen; (3) not requiring a sleep study to avoid delays in care in patients being discharged from the hospital; (4) remove spirometry as a requirement; and (5) not requiring BPAP without a backup rate failure to approve BPAP spontaneous/timed. The overarching goal of the Technical Expert Panel is to establish pathways that improve clinicians' management capability to provide Medicare beneficiaries access to appropriate home NIV therapy. Adoption of these proposed suggestions would result in the right device, for the right type of patient with hypoventilation syndromes, at the right time.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^88879602]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An important subgroup to consider in the discussion of non-invasive ventilation is the obstructive sleep apnea and COPD overlap syndrome. These patients have been systematically excluded from most randomized controlled trials of non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD, although they might benefit particularly well from the intervention. Another important consideration is whether one should modify the positive airway pressure modality strategy to continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation when obstructive sleep apnea is the predominant pathology in the overlap syndrome, akin to the recommendation in the obesity hypoventilation syndrome with severe sleep apnea, where continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation is the first line option. Patients with the overlap syndrome have lower 5 year survival rates than those obstructive sleep apnea even when treated with continuous positive airway pressure. However, in a prospective cohort, continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with the overlap syndrome improved survival and decreased hospital admissions. Whether adding high intensity non-invasive ventilation strategy to adequate end-expiratory pressure to maintain airway patency would serve to improve outcomes in this group of patients is not known. When confronted with patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and COPD overlap, it might be challenging to determine the primary factor responsible for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Nonetheless, pragmatic goals relating to positive airway pressure treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome are similar to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD and include correction of sleep hypoxemia, obstructive events and hypercapnia. In the absence of robust clinical trials in this population, the authors tend to use high intensity non-invasive ventilation when clinical evaluation points toward COPD as the biological cause for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, and positive airway pressure treatment when obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea predominate.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^acc6b8b9]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative intervention components for OSA/OHS — education and therapy options are described as exploratory. Intervention strategies are a final suggested component of algorithms, and educational interventions may be targeted toward increasing positive airway pressure use before surgery. In a tried approach for patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, outreach advised continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use for 2 weeks before surgery and bringing CPAP to the hospital. For patients identified as high risk, family and patient education regarding OSA and surgical risks is being explored. Other possible interventions needing more study include incentive spirometry, use of local or regional anesthesia if possible, minimizing opioid use, and prespecified post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) protocols. Use of perioperative oxygen improves oxygenation and apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) on postoperative Nights 1–3.

### Best clinical practices for the sleep center adjustment of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic alveolar hypoventilation syndromes [^f203005e]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

General recommendations for NPPV titration — The indications, goals of treatment, and side effects of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) treatment should be discussed in detail with the patient prior to the NPPV titration study, and careful mask fitting and a period of acclimatization to low pressure prior to the titration should be included as part of the NPPV protocol; NPPV titration with polysomnography (PSG) is the recommended method to determine an effective level of nocturnal ventilatory support in patients with chronic alveolar hypoventilation (CAH), and when treatment is initiated empirically a PSG should be utilized if possible to confirm that the final NPPV settings are effective or to make adjustments as necessary; NPPV treatment goals should be individualized but typically include prevention of worsening of hypoventilation during sleep, improvement in sleep quality, relief of nocturnal dyspnea, and providing respiratory muscle rest; when obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coexists with CAH, pressure settings for treatment of the OSA may be determined during the NPPV titration PSG following AASM Clinical Guidelines for the Manual Titration of Positive Airway Pressure in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea; attended NPPV titration with PSG is the recommended method to identify optimal treatment pressure settings for patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), CAH due to restrictive chest wall disease (RTCD), and acquired or central CAH syndromes in whom NPPV treatment is indicated, and attended PSG titration allows definitive identification of an adequate level of ventilatory support for patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) in whom treatment is indicated.

### Acute ventilatory failure complicating obesity hypoventilation: update on a' critical care syndrome' [^21fd2ef1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity can result in serious complications, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). OHS patients may present with acute-on-chronic ventilatory failure, necessitating acute care management. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent literature on acute ventilatory failure in OHS patients.

Recent Findings

Obese persons can develop acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and sleep hypoventilation due to disorders in lung mechanics, ventilatory drive, and neurohormonal and neuromodulators of breathing. Although there are no clearly defined predictors for OHS patients who are likely to develop acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, most such patients are middle-aged (mid-50s), morbidly obese, and have daytime hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and low serum pH values. Immediate ventilatory support, without sleep study confirmation, is necessary in most such patients. Patients with respiratory acidemia (pH < 7.30) or altered mental status may require intensive care unit monitoring. Noninvasive application of bilevel positive airway pressure therapy is the recommended initial ventilatory support under close monitoring. Prompt initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and rapidly improves the levels of blood gases.

Summary

Obese patients with sleep hypoventilation have an increased risk of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Early diagnosis and implementation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is recommended for these patients.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) titration and split-night studies — use in the inpatient setting — are characterized by the statement that, given the complexity of titration with need for technologist monitoring and environmental challenges, split night sleep studies or PAP titration studies are likely beneficial in only select patient populations with high acuity of illness; in hospitalized patients with hypoventilation, those adherent with PAP after in-hospital titration have fewer readmissions than nonadherent patients or those never set up with PAP therapy.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: weighing in on therapy options [^958eaf49]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is becoming an increasingly encountered condition both in respiratory outpatient clinics and in hospitalized patients. The health consequences and social disadvantages of obesity hypoventilation syndrome are significant. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy is commonly delayed when the syndrome is not recognized or misdiagnosed. Positive airway pressure therapy remains the mainstay of treatment and is effective in controlling sleep-disordered breathing and improving awake blood gases in the majority of individuals. Evidence supporting one mode of therapy over another is limited. Both continuous and bilevel therapy modes can successfully improve daytime gas exchange, with adherence to therapy an important modifiable factor in the response to treatment. Despite adherence to therapy, these individuals continue to experience excess mortality primarily due to cardiovascular events compared with those with eucapnic sleep apnea using CPAP. This difference likely arises from ongoing systemic inflammation secondary to the morbidly obese state. The need for a comprehensive approach to managing nutrition, weight, and physical activity in addition to reversal of sleep-disordered breathing is now widely recognized. Future studies need to evaluate the impact of a more aggressive and comprehensive treatment plan beyond managing sleep-disordered breathing. The impact of early identification and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing on the development and reversal of cardiometabolic dysfunction also requires further attention.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a review of epidemiology, pathophysiology, and perioperative considerations [^9d7f2861]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined by the triad of obesity, daytime hypoventilation, and sleep-disordered breathing without an alternative neuromuscular, mechanical, or metabolic cause of hypoventilation. It is a disease entity distinct from simple obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. OHS is often undiagnosed but its prevalence is estimated to be 10–20% in obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea and 0.15–0.3% in the general adult population. Compared with eucapnic obese patients, those with OHS present with severe upper airway obstruction, restrictive chest physiology, blunted central respiratory drive, pulmonary hypertension, and increased mortality. The mainstay of therapy is noninvasive positive airway pressure. Currently, information regarding OHS is extremely limited in the anesthesiology literature. This review will examine the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, screening, and treatment of OHS. Perioperative management of OHS will be discussed last.

The findings from this study are important and should provide the clinician with greater assurance that long-term management of patients with stable OHS and coexistent OSA with CPAP therapy is safe, effective and not inferior to BPAP in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, those individuals presenting with more severe respiratory failure, who are older or who have less severe OSA may still respond better to BPAP, highlighting the need for careful follow-up and considered clinical judgement. However, weight loss and reductions in sedentary behaviors should remain at the heart of our intervention strategies in this population.

### Assessment and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^f34915a5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by obesity, daytime hypercapnia, and sleep-disordered breathing in the absence of significant lung or respiratory muscle disease. Compared with eucapnic morbidly obese patients and eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients with OHS have increased health care expenses and are at higher risk of developing serious cardiovascular disease leading to early mortality. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, diagnosis and institution of effective treatment occur late in the course of the syndrome. Given that the prevalence of extreme obesity has increased considerably, it is likely that clinicians will encounter patients with OHS in their clinical practice. Therefore maintaining a high index of suspicion can lead to early recognition and treatment reducing the high burden of morbidity and mortality and related health care expenditure associated with undiagnosed and untreated OHS. In this review we define the clinical characteristics of the syndrome and review the pathophysiology, morbidity, and mortality associated with it. Last, we discuss currently available treatment modalities.

Rationale for the recommendation

The panel judged that the greatest benefit to screening would be in patients ultimately determined to have COPD–OSA overlap (true-positive results), as this might lead to better titration of settings to address OSA and might focus clinicians on OSA and/or obesity as contributors to hypoventilation rather than COPD alone. The panel judged that patients with true-negative or false-negative screen results would not be adversely or beneficially affected by screening, as a negative screen result would not change management compared with no screening being performed. False-positive screen results would have some negative effects (unnecessary costs and time of confirmatory testing of OSA using a sleep study); however, these are likely of minimal consequence, as they are part of a singular event. Furthermore, the burden of sleep testing may vary depending on whether a full in-hospital or clinic-based PSG is done (vs. a less-burdensome home sleep study).

The panel made this suggestion on the basis of the anticipated benefits of successfully identifying patients with severe OSA, as this may result in optimal management of their respiratory disease, including choice of CPAP versus NIV, better titration of EPAP, and weaning or discontinuation of inhalers if it is recognized that OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome contribute to hypercapnia and are treated. Use of a sensitive test such as the SBQ will pick up most of these patients (9 out of 10 per 100 patients) and may result in improved management. On the other hand, the high number of patients with false-positive results (58 out of 90 per 100 patients) will result in an increased number of diagnostic sleep tests, most of which will be negative. These were judged by the panel to be of minor consequence to patients, as described above.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^d2018b58]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative use of positive airway pressure in obstructive sleep apnea — matched observational studies and meta-analyses show varied perioperative effects: patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prescription had reduced cardiovascular adverse events versus undiagnosed OSA (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.15–0.77; P = 0.009), and another study found more cardiopulmonary complications without therapy compared with positive airway pressure (risk-adjusted rates 6.7% vs. 4%; P = 0.001). Meta-analyses including 904 patients suggest postoperative CPAP reduces apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) with a trend to reduced length of stay but no significant impact on postoperative adverse events, with low adherence reported (2.4–4.6 h/night). Despite prescribed therapy, one study reported 18% spent at least 30 minutes with oxygen saturation less than 90% the night after surgery.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — weight-loss interventions: For patients with OHS, we suggest using weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25–30% of actual body weight, noting that this degree of loss is most likely required to achieve resolution of hypoventilation (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). Many patients may not be able to achieve this target with lifestyle programs alone; those without contraindications may benefit from evaluation for bariatric surgery.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — comparative outcomes of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) show largely similar long‑term results. After 5 years, mortality was similar (NIV 11% vs. CPAP 15%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.36–1.87; P = 0.631), and composite cardiovascular events did not differ (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.56–2.44). Long‑term hospitalizations were comparable over a median of 5.2 years (48 of 107 on CPAP vs 51 of 97 on NIV; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.64–1.13). Short‑term resolution of hypercapnia (PaCO2 < 45 mm Hg) occurred in 46.6% with NIV and 36.3% with CPAP (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.94–1.77), and during longer‑term follow‑up in 51.9% with NIV versus 40.7% with CPAP (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.91–1.79). Exercise capacity increased by 26 m on the 6‑minute walk in one 2‑month study favoring NIV, but no significant difference in 6‑minute‑walk distance was seen with longer follow‑up. Other outcomes, including awake hypoxemia, hypercapnia, percentage of night with oxygen saturation < 90%, apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), mood, and emergency department visits, showed no difference between NIV and CPAP.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with hypoventilation syndrome (evaluation), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is very unlikely in these patients.

Other areas of clinical implementation of NIV: acute decompensation of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)

OHS is a severe form of obesity-induced respiratory compromise, defined by the coexistance of obesity, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime hypercapnia (awake resting PaCO 2 ≥ 45 mmHg). The pathophysiology of OHS involves reduced functional residual capacity due to obesity, impaired central response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and neurohormonal abnormalities. In stableambulatory OHS, positive airway pressure therapy improves the control of the obstructive sleep apnoea, enhances sleep quality, and optimize daytime gas-exchange. Therefore, CPAP is suggested as first-line treatment for outpatients with OHS and concurrent severe obstructive sleep apnea. OHS exacerbation is a common cause of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, often requiring ICU admission, particularly in the presence of respiratory acidosis. Compared to normocapnic patients with obesity, those with OHS have higher ICU admission rates and mortality. However, no formal guidelines for non-invasive management of the acute OHS decompensation, as most studies focus on ambulatory chronic patients. In the acute setting, BiPAP is considered the therapy of choice, as it maintains upper airway patency, unloads respiratory muscle, and improves alveolar ventilation. Full face mask are more effective than nasal mask in acutely ill patients, as they allow the delivery of higher pressures with reduced leakage.

Other areas of clinical implementation of NIV: pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF)

CF lung disease is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction due to mucus plugging, bronchial inflammation, and destruction of the lung parenchyma secondary to bronchiectasies, progressively leading to increased respiratory muscle workload to ensure adequate ventilation. The clinical course of CF is characterized by "pulmonary exacerbations", due to the inability of the respiratory muscles to meet the increased ventilation demand (e.g. respiratory tract infections), leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure. During acute exacerbations of CF, BiPAP is frequently used to unload the respiratory muscles, increase alveolar ventilation and enhance gas exchange. Although no RCTs are available comparing NIV to invasive ventilation, observational studies have shown that BiPAP is a reasonable first-line treatment option for hospitalised patients with severe respiratory exacerbations of CF, given the poor outcome of the patients undergoing invasive ventilation. HFNT therapy may serve as a viable alternative or complement to BiPAP, as it has demonstrated physiological benefits, such as reducing respiratory rate and minute ventilation.

### Recent advances in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^a8fa5088]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) consists of a combination of obesity and chronic hypercapnia accompanied by sleep-disordered breathing. During the last 3 decades, the prevalence of extreme obesity has markedly increased in the United States and other countries. With a global epidemic of obesity, the prevalence of OHS is bound to increase. Patients with OHS have a lower quality of life with increased health-care expenses and are at a higher risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and early mortality compared to eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, it is often unrecognized and treatment is frequently delayed. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion since early recognition and treatment reduces the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the definition and clinical presentation of OHS, provide a summary of its prevalence, review the current understanding of the pathophysiology, and discuss the recent advances in the therapeutic options.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sleep [^70a0892a]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The control of breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follows the same basic principles as in normal subjects, both awake and asleep, with an expected lower feedback response during sleep. This impacts nocturnal gas exchange and sleep quality most profoundly in patients with more severe COPD, as multiple factors come into play. Hypoventilation causes the most important gas-exchange alteration in COPD patients, leading to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, especially during rapid-eye-movement sleep, when marked respiratory muscle atonia occurs. The hypoxia leads to increased arousals, sleep disruption, pulmonary hypertension, and higher mortality. The primary mechanisms for this include decreased ventilatory responsiveness to hypercapnia, reduced respiratory muscle output, and marked increases in upper airway resistance. In the presence of more profound daytime hypercapnia, polysomnography should be considered (over nocturnal pulse oximetry) to rule out other co-existing sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (overlap syndrome) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Present consensus guidelines provide insight into the proper use of oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, and nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for those conditions, but several issues remain contentious. In order to provide optimal therapy to patients, the clinician must take into account certain reimbursement and implementation-process obstacles and the guidelines for treatment and coverage criteria.

### The effect of supplemental oxygen in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^d35a598a]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Low flow supplemental oxygen is commonly prescribed to patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). However, there is a paucity of data regarding its efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to assess the medium-term treatment efficacy of adding supplemental oxygen therapy to commonly prescribed treatment modalities in OHS.

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of a previous randomized controlled trial, we studied 302 sequentially screened OHS patients who were randomly assigned to noninvasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or lifestyle modification. Outcomes at 2 mo included arterial blood gases, symptoms, quality of life, blood pressure, polysomnography, spirometry, 6-min walk distance, and hospital resource utilization. Statistical analysis comparing patients with and without oxygen therapy in the three treatment groups was performed using an intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

In the noninvasive ventilation group, supplemental oxygen reduced systolic blood pressure although this could be also explained by a reduction in body weight experienced in this group. In the continuous positive airway pressure group, supplemental oxygen increased the frequency of morning confusion. In the lifestyle modification group, supplemental oxygen increased compensatory metabolic alkalosis and decreased the apnea-hypopnea index during sleep. Oxygen therapy was not associated with an increase in hospital resource utilization in any of the groups.

Conclusions

After 2 mo of follow-up, chronic oxygen therapy produced marginal changes that were insufficient to consider it, globally, as beneficial or deleterious. Because supplemental oxygen therapy did not increase hospital resource utilization, we recommend prescribing oxygen therapy to patients with OHS who meet criteria with close monitoring. Long-term studies examining outcomes such as incident cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are necessary.

### Using intra-breath oscillometry in obesity hypoventilation syndrome to detect tidal expiratory flow limitation: a potential marker to optimize CPAP therapy [^f61f020d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), a leading cause of chronic respiratory failure worldwide, is characterized by obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg·m − 2), and hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide ≥ 45 mmHg) that typically worsens at night. The pathophysiology of OHS is complex. Upper airway patency issues, disrupted control of breathing, and altered lung mechanics due to obesity may all contribute to the characteristic hypoventilation.

Due to this complex pathophysiology, optimal therapy for patients has not yet been clearly established. Current clinical guidance advises continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy intended to achieve daytime normocapnia, and in cases of insufficient clinical improvement, progression to bilevel ventilation. CPAP counteracts the increased mechanical load on the respiratory system and the subsequent decrease in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Additionally, it manages upper airway patency issues, which are common in OHS patients. Bilevel ventilation may be useful in patients with exhausted respiratory drive or where upper airway obstruction is not prominent. Despite this practice, it is unclear how the "ideal CPAP" level can be determined and whether CPAP failure can be managed with a more optimized CPAP setting. There are currently no official titration protocols in use. Recent studies have used protocols where gradual increase of CPAP is continued even after obstructive events and flow limitation have ceased, if saturation goals are not reached. A recent study has shown the majority of patients with lower AHI (< 30/h) can still benefit from CPAP values of 8–14 cmH 2 O. This effect is probably attributable to restored absolute lung volumes. While hypoventilation and upper airway patency issues can be assessed using polysomnography, changes in the absolute lung volume and subsequent airway dynamics are currently not evaluated during routine therapy induction for OHS. Optimizing therapy by restoring EELV might improve long-term outcomes in this patient population.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in bariatric surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: a 2021 update [^eb9fbfc4]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Postoperative oxygenation

Obesity is associated with increased work of breathing as well as higher risk of perioperative atelectasis persisting for longer duration compared to patients with normal weight. In addition, OSA is a common condition among patients with severe obesity. It is associated with increased risk of cardiopulmonary events and a significant mortality rate, in particular in cases with high Apnoea-Hypopnea index (AHI). The STOP-BANG (Snoring, Tiredness during daytime, Observed apnoea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index, Age, Neck circumference, Gender) questionnaire might be used in the preoperative evaluation to identify patients with high risk of suffering from this comorbidity. Patients with OSA have historically been considered to be at a high risk of perioperative complications, particularly those of respiratory nature. Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome may exhibit even higher risk of cardiopulmonary complications and longer hospital stay, compared to patients with OSA alone.

Modern minimally invasive surgical techniques, combined with an emphasis on opioid-sparing analgesic approaches, and the use of CPAP/BiPAP treatment when necessary, can decrease the risk of cardiopulmonary complications in patients with OSA who undergo bariatric surgery.

Since the majority of the potentially dangerous hypoxic events occur in close proximity to the discontinuation of anaesthesia or after opioids are given, a standard or slightly prolonged observation in the PACU will be sufficient for most patients. A postoperative positioning in a head-elevated, semi-seated position prevents further development of atelectasis and may improve oxygenation. Supplemental oxygen improves oxygen saturation but may increase the duration and time to detection of apnoea/hypopnoea as well as carbon dioxide retention and should therefore be used with caution. Positive airway pressure treatment can be used to prevent hypoxic events in the postoperative phase and should be continued in patients using CPAP/BiPAP treatment before surgery in order to reduce the risk for apnoea and other complications.

In addition, in patients with hypoxemia (defined as an oxygen saturation < 90%) during the immediate postoperative period, non-invasive positive pressure treatment such as CPAP or NIPPV (with or without supplemental oxygen) should be used liberally. Standardized discharge criteria can be used to determine when the patient is ready to be discharged from the PACU, in addition to a satisfactory clinical evaluation to ensure that the patient has stable vital signs, including adequate respiratory rate and depth. Finally, as stated previously, it is recommended to minimize systemic opioid use in order to reduce episodes of apnoea/hypopnea (Table 4).

### CPAP titration failure is not equivalent to long-term CPAP treatment failure in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a case series [^762f1c9c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Medium and long-term trials comparing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with noninvasive ventilation in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome have shown no differences in outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether CPAP therapy should be prescribed if significant hypoxemia persists during CPAP titration, despite optimization of upper airway obstructive events or if maximum CPAP pressure is reached. We aimed to examine the effects of 6 weeks of home CPAP therapy on gas exchange in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome who failed CPAP titration due to persistent hypoxemia.

Methods

This case series is a substudy of a randomized-controlled trial evaluating efficacy of 3 different PAP modalities in obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patients randomized to CPAP who failed titration and were prescribed CPAP are included. CPAP failure was defined as spending more than 20% of total sleep time with oxygen saturation below 90% despite adequate resolution of apneas and hypopneas. Follow-up data included in-laboratory polysomnogram on prescribed CPAP after 6 weeks of home CPAP therapy.

Results

Three of seven participants (43%) randomized to CPAP failed CPAP titration. All were morbidly obese, had severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 90 events/h) and severe sleep hypoxemia (percentage of total sleep time with oxygen saturation < 90% [T90] = 60–89%). Hypoxemia (T90: 43–67%, T80: 0–31%, and T70: 0–11%) and hypercapnia (transcutaneous pressure of CO₂ levels > 50 mm Hg) persisted during CPAP titration polysomnogram. The final polysomnogram after 6 weeks of adherent home CPAP therapy showed effective control of obstructive sleep apnea. Hypoventilation and hypoxemia severity decreased significantly in all 3 participants.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that CPAP titration failure does not equal CPAP treatment failure.

Table 3 — implications of strong versus conditional recommendations are outlined for patients, clinicians, and policy makers. For patients under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not," whereas under a conditional recommendation, "Most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not." For clinicians under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while under a conditional recommendation clinicians should "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals making decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working toward a decision." For policy makers, a strong recommendation means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators," whereas a conditional recommendation implies "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place."

IMV in NMD/CWD

Recommendations

54. In patients with NMD or CWD, senior staff should be involved in decision-making, in conjunction with home mechanical ventilation specialists, if experience is limited, and especially when the appropriateness of IMV is questioned (grade D).

55. Advance care planning, particularly around the potential future use of IMV, is recommended in patients with progressive NMD or CWD. This may best be supported by elective referral to a home ventilation service (grade D).

IMV strategy in NMD and CWD

Good practice points
Patients with NMD usually require lower levels of pressure support.
Patients with CWD usually require higher levels of pressure support.
PEEP in the range 5–10 is commonly required to increase residual volume and reduce oxygen dependency in both patient groups.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome

Recommendations

56. Controlled oxygen therapy should be used in patients with hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and AHRF (grade D).

57. In patients with OHS, NIV should be started in AHRF using the same criteria as in AECOPD (grade B).

58. NIV is indicated in some hospitalised obese hypercapnic patients with day time somnolence, sleep-disordered breathing and/or right heart failure in the absence of acidosis (grade D).

NIV settings and placement in OHS

Good practice points
High inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) settings are commonly required in patients with OHS (eg, IPAP > 30, EPAP > 8).
Volume control (or volume assured) modes of providing NIV may be more effective when high inflation pressures are required.

NIV failure in OHS

Good practice points
Fluid overload commonly contributes to ventilatory failure in patients with OHS, and its degree is easily underestimated.
Forced diuresis may be useful.
As the risk of NIV failure is greater, and intubation may be more difficult, placement in HDU/ICU for NIV is recommended.

Discontinuing NIV in OHS

Good practice points
NIV can be discontinued as in patients with AECOPD.
Many patients with AHRF secondary to OHS will require long-term domiciliary support (CPAP or NIV).
Following an episode of AHRF referral to a home ventilation service is recommended.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a state-of-the-art review [^e927fe32]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity hyoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined as the triad of obesity, daytime hypoventilation, and sleep-disordered breathing in the absence of an alternative neuromuscular, mechanical or metabolic explanation for hypoventilation. During the last 3 decades the prevalence of extreme obesity has markedly increased in the United States and other countries. With such a global epidemic of obesity, the prevalence of OHS is bound to increase. Patients with OHS have a lower quality of life, with increased healthcare expenses, and are at higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension and early mortality, compared to eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing. OHS often remains undiagnosed until late in the course of the disease. Early recognition is important, as these patients have significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatment can lead to significant improvement in patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. This review will include disease definition and epidemiology, clinical characteristics of the syndrome, pathophysiology, and morbidity and mortality associated with it. Lastly, treatment modalities will be discussed in detail.

### Switch of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a pilot study [^49e1f341]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major worldwide public health issue. The main respiratory complication stemming from obesity is obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). OHS was defined, in 1999, by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as the association of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2); daytime hypercapnia (paCO2 > 45 mm Hg); and sleep disordered breathing, after excluding other causes of hypoventilation. OHS is a frequent condition with the prevalence of OHS in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 being 31%.

OHS is an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition, despite the fact that a treatment with positive airway pressure improves quality of life and decreases morbidity in these patients. The application of a positive airway pressure through noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), decreases mortality in patients presenting with OHS.

To date, the main unresolved question is to determine the respective position of NIV and CPAP when treating these patients. If some studies have attempted to determine different OHS's phenotypes to predict the outcome of CPAP therapy; only two studies prospectively compared NIV and CPAP treatment in OHS. To date, the superiority of NIV over CPAP in the treatment of OHS has not been proven. However, 26 to 50% of patients suffering from OHS are diagnosed in an acute setting, and most often treated with NIV which remains their usual ventilatory mode for the rest of their life.

Once stability has been reached, the question then arises as to whether NIV should be switched to CPAP. To our knowledge, no prospective trial has evaluated in real life conditions the feasibility of a protocol switching stable patients from NIV to CPAP.

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and effect of a standardized protocol, switching patients with OHS, from NIV to CPAP. We hypothesized that there will be no difference in efficacy after switching NIV to CPAP, on AHI, diurnal and nocturnal alveolar gas exchange (daytime arterial blood gas (ABG), nighttime transcutaneous oxygen saturation and transcutaneous measurement of pCO2 (ptCO2)), but also on sleepiness, quality of sleep and quality of life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire (SRI)).

After implementing non-PAP therapy, "clinical reassessment should include follow-up testing to ensure successful treatment of OSA with the chosen treatment at the appropriate time interval," but "Follow-up testing is not necessary for positional therapy when it is effective on the diagnostic study." Regarding test selection, "multiple factors should influence the choice including comorbidities (eg, hypoventilation syndromes or chronic opioid treatment), clinical suspicion of hypoventilation or central sleep apnea, feasibility, cost of testing, and resource utilization." For oral appliances, "Follow-up PSG or HSAT should be performed following patient acclimatization, reviewed by a trained sleep medicine specialist and necessary adjustments should be made to the device to ensure adequate control of OSA."

### A randomised controlled trial of CPAP versus non-invasive ventilation for initial treatment of obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^639a5cdc]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is the most common indication for home ventilation, although the optimal therapy remains unclear, particularly for severe disease. We compared Bi-level and continuous positive airways pressure (Bi-level positive airway pressure (PAP); CPAP) for treatment of severe OHS.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre, parallel, double-blind trial for initial treatment of OHS, with participants randomised to nocturnal Bi-level PAP or CPAP for 3months. The primary outcome was frequency of treatment failure (hospital admission, persistent ventilatory failure or non-adherence); secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleepiness.

Results

Sixty participants were randomised; 57 completed follow-up and were included in analysis (mean age 53years, body mass index 55kg/m 2, PaCO 2 60mmHg). There was no difference in treatment failure between groups (Bi-level PAP, 14.8% vs CPAP, 13.3%, p = 0.87). Treatment adherence and wake PaCO 2 were similar after 3months (5.3hours/night Bi-level PAP, 5.0hours/night CPAP, p = 0.62; PaCO 2 44.2 and 45.9mmHg, respectively, p = 0.60). Between-group differences in improvement in sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 0.3 (95% CI -2.8, 3.4), p = 0.86) and HRQoL (Short Form (SF)36-SF6d 0.025 (95% CI -0.039, 0.088), p = 0.45) were not significant. Baseline severity of ventilatory failure (PaCO 2) was the only significant predictor of persistent ventilatory failure at 3months (OR 2.3, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

In newly diagnosed severe OHS, Bi-level PAP and CPAP resulted in similar improvements in ventilatory failure, HRQoL and adherence. Baseline PaCO 2 predicted persistent ventilatory failure on treatment. Long-term studies are required to determine whether these treatments have different cost-effectiveness or impact on mortality.

Treatment

Effective management of OSA requires a comprehensive assessment of each individual patient's phenotype as well as long‐term follow‐up and monitoring. Behavioral, medical, dental, and surgical options exist for treatment of sleep apnea.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is a first‐line therapy for all patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and has been shown to both reduce the AHI 23 and improve self‐reported sleepiness and quality of life. 24 It is cost effective, with an estimated incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of $15 915 per quality‐adjusted life year gained. 20 The therapeutic mechanism of PAP is pneumatic splinting of the upper airway, thereby reducing airflow obstruction and apneic events. The 2 major PAP delivery modes are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi‐level positive airway pressure. CPAP is the preferred first‐line modality in most patients with OSA, while bi‐level positive airway pressure is generally reserved for patients with OSA accompanied by hypoventilation syndromes, although it can also be used in patients with OSA alone who fail to tolerate CPAP and in some cases of CSA. The optimal settings are ideally determined via manual titration of PAP during full‐night polysomnography to a pressure that eliminates upper airway obstruction and remains tolerable to the patient. Alternatively, some patients undergo a split‐night study in which PAP titration is performed following the diagnostic portion of polysomnography. A split‐night study requires that a conclusive diagnosis of moderate‐to‐severe OSA be made with at least 3 hours remaining in the test to conduct PAP titration.

Auto‐titrating CPAP (APAP) is another option that offers the advantage of performing titration at home rather than in a sleep laboratory. In APAP, the clinician programs a pressure range, and the level of administered PAP is automatically adjusted throughout the night to the lowest pressure required to maintain upper airway patency using proprietary event‐detection software. Several randomized trials comparing fixed CPAP with APAP showed either no difference or, in some cases, a small advantage of APAP with respect to adherence rate, reduction in AHI, and improvement in sleepiness in cohorts with uncomplicated OSA. 25, 26 Notably, patients with HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other form of significant lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and SDB related to neuromuscular disease were excluded from these studies, and current guidelines recommend against use of APAP for either pressure titration or therapy in these patients. 27
