## Question

Multiple sclerosis new diagnosis inpayient with new onset vision loss management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management plan for new-onset vision loss in a patient with newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis in the inpatient setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming whether this is typical demyelinating optic neuritis versus an atypical optic neuropathy. Then, I should evaluate red flags and urgent differentials. Next, I'll initiate acute therapy, complete baseline MS workup, determine disease activity and disease-modifying therapy eligibility, select the initial agent, establish monitoring, provide counseling, address special populations, and plan long-term management with de-escalation in mind if appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the working diagnosis is typical demyelinating optic neuritis as a clinically isolated syndrome, because that frames both acute treatment and the MS diagnostic pathway; typical ON is often unilateral with subacute painful vision loss and central scotoma, and the neuro-ophthalmic exam should document visual acuity, color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, fields, and optic disc appearance, while acknowledging that most MS-related ON is retrobulbar and may have a normal disc initially [^111SDxEX]. I should confirm that newer diagnostic considerations allow optic nerve involvement to function as an additional region for dissemination in space in some proposed frameworks, which may accelerate diagnosis when corroborated by MRI and paraclinical testing, but I need to be cautious and apply criteria rigorously to avoid misclassification and misdiagnosis [^111uvpDJ] [^115exA7U].

> Wait, let me verify atypical features and differentials before I lock onto MS-related ON, because bilateral severe loss, profound disc edema with hemorrhages, chiasmatic or longitudinally extensive anterior optic nerve enhancement, and perineuritis shift concern toward NMOSD or MOGAD and mandate different testing and treatment pathways; urgent MRI orbits with fat-suppressed T1 post-contrast and STIR, serum anti-AQP4-IgG and anti-MOG-IgG, and visual evoked potentials help distinguish these entities and confirm demyelination, and I should also keep other causes of acute vision loss in the differential including ischemic, compressive, inflammatory, infectious, and toxic-metabolic etiologies when the phenotype is off-pattern [^111SDxEX] [^115yeq7M] [^115HEn6K] [^113zADiS].

> I will now initiate acute treatment for presumed typical ON without waiting for full MS confirmation, because high-dose corticosteroids shorten time to visual recovery even though they do not change long-term visual outcomes; intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days is standard, often followed by a brief oral taper for symptom control, and timely treatment is appropriate when the clinical picture is convincing and serious mimics have been reasonably excluded [^115m2jDc] [^117PeKEm]. Hold on, I should verify the oral regimen statement from the draft that suggested oral methylprednisolone 1–1.5 mg/kg/day as an alternative; that lower-dose oral steroid strategy has historically been associated with higher relapse risk in ONTT-era data with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg, so if an oral approach is used it should be a bioequivalent high-dose oral methylprednisolone regimen rather than low-dose daily steroids, meaning the prior low-dose suggestion needs correction here to avoid reinforcing an outdated practice [^115m2jDc] [^117PeKEm]. If there is no clinical improvement within about a week or if NMOSD is suspected, I should escalate promptly to plasma exchange, as steroid-unresponsive optic neuritis in antibody-mediated disease responds better to early apheresis [^111Go6KC].

> Next, I should review and complete the baseline MS diagnostic workup to establish dissemination in space and time or identify a high-risk CIS suitable for early DMT; brain MRI with gadolinium to assess periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, and infratentorial regions plus spinal imaging when indicated are core, CSF oligoclonal bands can substitute for dissemination in time when MRI is borderline, and OCT can document retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell complex damage as a baseline biomarker of neuroaxonal injury in the afferent visual pathway [^115yeq7M] [^113VZt9W]. Let me consider the evolving literature proposing the optic nerve as a fifth region for DIS to improve sensitivity, but I should double-check the specificity trade-offs and apply contemporary criteria with discipline; in parallel, genetic risk scores at first ON presentation are investigational but may refine risk stratification for conversion when combined with clinical features, and I should frame them as optional adjuncts rather than standard-of-care [^111uvpDJ] [^115JFRHH] [^114y7Dx8] [^111n7tpA].

> I need to ensure I classify disease activity and DMT eligibility accurately, because guidelines recommend early treatment for active disease or high-risk CIS; active disease generally includes recent clinical relapse or MRI activity such as new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and the AAN recommends initiating DMT after a single demyelinating event if there are two or more characteristic brain lesions, which captures high-risk CIS after ON [^115XTzWh]. Let me reconsider the timing, as the window-of-opportunity concept supports earlier therapy to reduce future inflammatory events and disability accrual; in lower-risk CIS with a normal MRI, close surveillance with periodic MRI is reasonable with shared decision-making about early initiation versus watchful waiting [^114usY3w] [^1175SSiP].

> I will now examine initial DMT selection with a structured, risk-stratified approach and shared decision-making; for patients aiming to minimize fetal risk or with low activity, interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate are reasonable, for moderate activity or preference for oral convenience, dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide can be considered with counseling on teratogenicity and washout, and for high activity or poor prognostic features, higher efficacy agents such as fingolimod, natalizumab, or anti-CD20 therapies provide faster disease control but require rigorous safety monitoring and infection risk mitigation, all chosen in dialogue with the patient [^116TL2uj] [^112V9qWN]. I should confirm safety specifics before deciding: monitor JCV serology and quantify PML risk with natalizumab, perform cardiac screening for sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators, screen for and prophylax HBV where indicated before anti-CD20 therapy, and discuss pregnancy planning especially if teriflunomide is considered; for primary progressive MS, I should not forget that ocrelizumab is the recommended option in eligible patients [^1147tnva] [^113AXAdX] [^1159oaMX] [^112CK7AN].

> Next, I should review a monitoring plan consistent with a treat-to-target paradigm; clinically, follow-ups at roughly 3, 6, and 12 months in the first year and then semiannually are common, with MRI at 6–12 months from baseline and annually thereafter to detect subclinical activity, and treatment response should integrate relapses, disability change, and MRI lesion accrual to decide on continuation versus escalation, maintaining vigilance for laboratory and safety surveillance aligned with the chosen DMT [^115rbv1u]. Hold on, I should verify that for patients on platform therapies who show breakthrough activity, switching to a more efficacious agent is favored over lateral switches within the same class, and continuing a stable regimen is appropriate when there is no clinical or MRI activity and safety is acceptable [^1133HXTh] [^1131G7Bq] [^113ecswv].

> I will now counsel the patient comprehensively, because informed, shared decisions improve adherence and outcomes; I should clarify that DMTs reduce relapses and new MRI activity but do not treat current symptoms, outline the required monitoring including MRIs and labs, address modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking cessation, vitamin D sufficiency, and exercise, review reproductive planning and teratogenic risks where applicable, highlight rare but serious risks like PML in specified agents, and set expectations about adherence strategies to maintain efficacy [^113AXAdX] [^112V9qWN]. But wait, what if comorbidities complicate care; I must screen for and manage depression, cardiometabolic disease, and other common conditions since they influence diagnostic delay, disability trajectory, and quality of life in MS [^111uDZem].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios to avoid therapeutic missteps; in pediatric-onset MS, disease burden and relapse rates are higher and evidence supports earlier use of higher-efficacy therapies when appropriate, with attention to access and regulatory frameworks that vary by region, and during pregnancy, interferons or glatiramer may be continued in select cases while teriflunomide is contraindicated and requires accelerated elimination if exposure occurs [^112Uscr7] [^113DQqz3]. If red flags ultimately point to NMOSD or MOGAD rather than MS, I need to stop MS-directed DMTs and pivot to antibody-mediated disease regimens, given the distinct pathophysiology and relapse prevention strategies in these conditions [^111SCEUk].

> Finally, I need to plan for long-term disease management and potential de-escalation; sustained control with high-efficacy therapy early in the course is associated with lower risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS, but as patients age and inflammatory activity wanes, the benefit-risk calculus may favor dose spacing, de-escalation, or even discontinuation in carefully selected older, stable patients after shared decision-making and close monitoring, recognizing trial data in older, inactive populations and evolving expert recommendations [^115EYSLs] [^1143DLeZ]. Let me double-check that any de-escalation is coupled with a clear surveillance plan so that reactivation is detected promptly and treatment can be re-intensified if needed [^116X2Ezj].

> In summary, the flow is pragmatic and safety-focused: confirm typical ON clinically and with targeted testing while excluding atypical red flags, treat acutely with high-dose corticosteroids without unnecessary delay, complete MS workup to define risk and eligibility, start DMT early for active disease or high-risk CIS, select therapy through shared decision-making with precise safety monitoring, follow a treat-to-target monitoring schedule with timely escalation for breakthrough activity, counsel comprehensively on risks, lifestyle, and reproductive plans, adapt for pediatrics or pregnancy, avoid misdiagnosis pitfalls such as NMOSD/MOGAD, and anticipate long-term strategies including de-escalation in stable older patients, always verifying that each step aligns with guideline-supported best practices and the patient's priorities [^115pjkt8] [^113YtwiF] [^111SDxEX] [^114JUvZM] [^116X2Ezj].

For an inpatient with a new MS diagnosis and acute vision loss, immediate high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3–5 days) [^115m2jDc] is standard to accelerate visual recovery, followed by an oral prednisone taper if needed [^115m2jDc]. MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium is essential to confirm **optic neuritis** [^115yeq7M] and exclude mimics; if atypical features are present, include spinal MRI, CSF analysis, and serologic testing for NMOSD/MOGAD [^111SDxEX]. Initiate a **disease-modifying therapy (DMT)** [^113YtwiF] during hospitalization or soon after discharge to reduce relapse risk and disability progression [^115pjkt8]. Arrange close neurology and ophthalmology follow-up with MRI monitoring [^114JUvZM], and provide patient education on relapse recognition, DMT adherence, and lifestyle modifications [^113AXAdX].

---

## Immediate inpatient management

### High-dose intravenous corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Acute optic neuritis in MS to accelerate visual recovery [^115m2jDc].

- **Regimen**: IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days [^115m2jDc].

- **Oral taper**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 11 days, then taper over 4 days if needed.

- **Note**: Steroids speed recovery but do not alter long-term visual outcomes [^115m2jDc] [^117PeKEm].

---

### Diagnostic evaluation

- **MRI brain and orbits with gadolinium**: Confirm optic neuritis, assess dissemination in space/time, and exclude mimics [^115HEn6K] [^115yeq7M] [^111SDxEX].

- **Lumbar puncture**: If atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty, assess oligoclonal bands and IgG index [^115yeq7M].

- **Serologic testing**: If atypical, test for NMOSD (AQP4-IgG) and MOGAD (MOG-IgG) [^111SDxEX] [^115HEn6K].

---

## Initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT)

### Timing and rationale

Early initiation of **DMT** during hospitalization or shortly after discharge reduces **relapses** and **disability** [^113YtwiF] [^115pjkt8]. Before starting DMT, discuss benefits, risks, and the importance of adherence [^113AXAdX].

---

### Selection of DMT

First-line options include **interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine** [^116TL2uj] [^112PkAjq]. Selection should be based on disease activity, comorbidities, safety profile, and patient preferences [^112V9qWN] [^116TL2uj].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

### Clinical monitoring

- **Neurology follow-up**: Within 2–4 weeks post-discharge, then every 3–6 months [^114usY3w].

- **Ophthalmology follow-up**: Visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and OCT [^11325cbt].

- **Patient education**: Teach relapse recognition, adherence, and lifestyle modifications [^113AXAdX].

---

### Imaging surveillance

MRI monitoring should include a **baseline study** [^114JUvZM]. Repeat MRI at 6 and 12 months, then annually to detect new lesions and guide therapy [^114usY3w].

---

## Management of complications and comorbidities

### Acute complications

Monitor for **steroid-related effects**, including hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and infections. For persistent visual deficits, refer for low-vision aids and occupational therapy [^117PeKEm].

---

### Long-term complications

Monitor **disease progression** and adjust DMT as needed [^113ecswv] [^1133HXTh]. Manage comorbidities, including cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis, and mental health conditions [^111uDZem].

---

## Patient education and support

Provide **education** on multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and treatment goals. Connect patients to support groups and counseling resources, and encourage smoking cessation, regular exercise, and a balanced diet [^113AXAdX].

---

### Management of acute optic neuritis [^115m2jDc]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis is a common condition that causes reversible loss of vision. It can be clinically isolated or can arise as one of the manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Occasionally, cases are due to other causes, leading to radically different management strategies. The treatment of optic neuritis has been investigated in several trials, with results indicating that corticosteroids can speed up the recovery of vision without affecting the final visual outcome. However, other aspects of management remain controversial, with uncertainty about when to investigate and treat.

- **Diagnostic features**: This document reviews the diagnostic features of optic neuritis and its differential diagnosis.
- **Practical guidance on management**: Practical guidance is provided for the management of patients.
- **Association with multiple sclerosis**: The condition's association with multiple sclerosis is discussed, in light of studies defining the risk of multiple sclerosis development. Additionally, results of trials using disease-modifying drugs in these individuals are considered.

### Recurrent optic neuritis and perineuritis followed by an unexpected discovery: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society case conference proceedings [^111SDxEX]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Our patient initially presented with several episodes of longitudinally extensive anterior optic neuritis (ON), some with chiasmatic and perineural involvement signifying perineuritis. This was in conjunction with evidence of optic disc hemorrhages, all red flags for typical demyelinating ON. The triggers for these reoccurrences were varied and most notably included the failure of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment in conjunction with CD19 hyper-repopulation while receiving treatment with rituximab [Figure 1]. The later development of leptomeningeal enhancement seen on MRI led us to consider other disorders and widen the differential diagnosis.

- **Inflammatory and infectious considerations**: ON in multiple sclerosis is typically unilateral with mild to moderate vision loss and diffuse or central visual field loss [Table]. Ophthalmoscopy is typically unremarkable acutely, given the retrobulbar localization of the initial lesion in most. MRI might demonstrate unilateral, retrobulbar, and/or canalicular short anterior segment lesions with optic nerve enhancement acutely in most cases.

Distinguishing features of optic neuritis, perineuritis, and neoplastic targeting of the anterior visual system are crucial. NMOSD and MOG antibody disease (MOGAD) ON commonly results in severe vision loss and is frequently bilateral, with distinguishing features on MRI and on fundus examination.

Both NMOSD and MOGAD may present with longitudinally extensive optic nerve and spinal cord (≥ 3 vertebral segments) lesions on MRI, with more frequent involvement of the lower cord and conus associated with MOGAD.

### Disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis - a review of approved medications [^112jT9gB]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of disability in young adults. Irreversible axonal damage occurs even in the earliest phases of disease evolution. Although some people with relapsing−remitting MS (RRMS) have a 'benign' disease course with minimal disease activity and impairment, most patients experience increasing disability over time and eventually convert to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). There is still no curative treatment, but during the last 20 years, eight different therapies have become available, including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and mitoxantrone, and several new compounds are in development.

All approved medications primarily have anti-inflammatory effects, and there is increasing evidence indicating that they are more effective in the early phases of disease development. With the development of more effective treatments, the aim of treatment has dramatically changed in recent decades, from merely reducing relapse rates and slowing disability progression to preventing all evidence of new disease activity. The review discusses the mode of action and documented effects of current immunomodulatory MS therapies.

### Towards a biological view of multiple sclerosis from early subtle to clinical progression: an expert opinion [^1146g2RS]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The earliest medical descriptions of multiple sclerosis (MS) date to the first half of the nineteenth century, with these descriptions already highlighting the relapsing–remitting nature of the disease. In the subsequent decades, two classic clinical phenotypes of MS emerged: relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS. Classification of MS into the relapsing–remitting, primary progressive (PPMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS) phenotypes was formalized by the United States Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of New Agents in Multiple Sclerosis for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) in 1996, with revisions following in 2014. The objective of the NMSS classification was to provide clear and consistent definitions of patient groups. The NMSS classification has been used in almost all clinical trials since its creation and has become widely adopted in clinical practice; however, it is based solely on clinical course, and the authors noted at the time that there were no biomarkers for the various phenotypes.

The NMSS classification has been highly influential in shaping the management of MS. The majority of approved treatments for MS are indicated for the relapsing–remitting form of the disease, and the NMSS classification is credited with the progress that has been made in the treatment of this form of MS. However, there are few drugs that have been approved for progressive forms of MS, and despite the widespread use of the NMSS classification, accumulating evidence suggests that the nature of the underlying pathology is the same across all.

### Microperimetry as a diagnostic tool for the detection of early, subclinical retinal damage and visual impairment in multiple sclerosis [^11325cbt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

A majority of multiple sclerosis patients experience visual impairment, often as the initial presenting symptom of the disease. While structural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve have demonstrated correlations with brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis using magnetic resonance imaging, a non-invasive, cost-effective, and clinically efficacious modality to identify early damage and facilitate prompt therapeutic intervention to slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and its ocular manifestations is still urgently needed. In this study, we sought to determine the role of macular sensitivity measured by microperimetry in the detection of subclinical multiple sclerosis-related retinal damage and visual dysfunction.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional observational case-control study involved population-based samples of multiple sclerosis patients and age-, race-, and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Among the key criteria for the multiple sclerosis patients were diagnosis by the McDonald criteria, visual acuity greater than 20/25, and no history of optic neuritis. Macular sensitivity and average macular thickness were measured in all subjects using microperimetry and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients were measured using bivariate correlations. Sample means, mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using independent sample t-tests.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight eyes from 14 MS patients and 18 eyes from 9 control subjects were included. Mean macular sensitivity of con…

### Retinal asymmetry in multiple sclerosis [^1172zTau]. Brain (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease that predominantly affects a young adult population in the prime of their working life. Accurate and early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is important because of access to FDA-approved, effective disease-modifying treatments for a disease that affects more than 2 million individuals globally. In the United States, approximately 400,000 patients suffer from multiple sclerosis, and the annual economic burden is about $10 billion. There is a need to improve the diagnostic work-up, incorporating technologies that are scalable to a population level to enhance screening for this disabling condition.

The last revision of the diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis highlighted the importance of interrogating the diagnostic value of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) for refinement of diagnostic criteria. Could the inclusion of the optic nerve as a fifth CNS location for dissemination in space or time improve overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity levels? Many multiple sclerosis lesions, including those of the optic nerve, are asymptomatic, and detecting them earlier will permit an earlier diagnosis.

### Investigating whether dissemination in time is essential to diagnose relapsing multiple sclerosis [^115JFRHH]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

- **Performance of the DIS criteria in patients with and without optic neuritis**: The performance of the DIS criteria for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) using the 2017 McDonald criteria is noteworthy. This is observed in patients with both optic neuritis and non-optic neuritis presentations.

The findings demonstrate that involvement of ≥ 4 regions in DIS displays high specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for a diagnosis of 2017 McDonald MS in patients both with and without optic neuritis. In the subgroup of patients undergoing optic nerve evaluation, the sensitivity of ≥ 4/5 regions in DIS was lower among patients with a non-optic neuritis presentation compared to those with optic neuritis (47% vs. 68%). However, this sensitivity is similar to that of the 2017 McDonald DIS and dissemination in time (DIT) criteria when applied to baseline MRI scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, with both at 47%.

The findings remain consistent when considering a second clinical attack or new T2 lesions at follow-up in the entire cohort. There is a noted fall in sensitivity as lesions appear in a greater number of DIS regions, but specificity increases.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^116TL2uj]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

In the medical management of multiple sclerosis, particularly with disease-modifying therapies, the ECTRIMS/EAN 2018 guidelines provide specific recommendations. For patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, the choice of agent depends on various factors including patient characteristics, comorbidities, disease severity/activity, drug safety profile, and drug accessibility. This decision should be made in discussion with the patient. The recommended drugs include:

- **Interferons and related agents**: interferon β-1b, interferon β-1a (SC, IM), peginterferon β-1a
- **Glatiramer acetate**
- **Teriflunomide**
- **Dimethyl fumarate**
- **Cladribine**
- **Fingolimod**
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: daclizumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab

### Risk of new disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis who continue or discontinue disease-modifying therapies (DISCOMS): a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, phase 4, non-inferiority trial [^1143DLeZ]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis typically has its onset in young adults, and new disease activity tends to diminish with age. Most clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis have not enrolled individuals older than 55 years. Observational studies suggest that the risk of a return of disease activity after discontinuation of disease-modifying therapies is greatest in younger patients with recent relapses or MRI activity. We aimed to determine whether the risk of disease recurrence in older patients with no recent disease activity who discontinue disease-modifying therapy is increased compared to those who remain on disease-modifying therapy.

- **Methods**: DISCOMS was a multicentre, randomised, controlled, rater-blinded, phase 4, non-inferiority trial. Individuals with multiple sclerosis of any subtype, aged 55 years or older, with no relapse within the past 5 years or new MRI lesions in the past 3 years while continuously taking an approved disease-modifying therapy, were enrolled at 19 multiple sclerosis centres in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1 by site) with an interactive response technology system to either continue or discontinue disease-modifying therapy. Relapse assessors and MRI readers were masked to patient assignment, while patients and treating investigators were not masked. The primary outcome was the percentage of individuals with a new disease event, defined as a multiple sclerosis relapse or a new or expanding T2 brain MRI lesion, over 2 years. We assessed whether discontinuation of disease-modifying therapy was non-inferior to continuation.

### Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: Guidelines from the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis [^113LtoZe]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The International Panel on MS Diagnosis presents revised diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). The focus remains on the objective demonstration of dissemination of lesions in both time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is integrated with clinical and other paraclinical diagnostic methods. The revised criteria facilitate the diagnosis of MS in patients with a variety of presentations, including "monosymptomatic" disease suggestive of MS, disease with a typical relapsing-remitting course, and disease with insidious progression, without clear attacks and remissions. Previously used terms such as "clinically definite" and "probable MS" are no longer recommended. The outcome of a diagnostic evaluation is either MS, "possible MS" (for those at risk for MS, but for whom diagnostic evaluation is equivocal), or "not MS".

### Recent developments in multiple sclerosis therapeutics [^1174J3EP]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, the most common neurologic disorder of young adults, is traditionally considered to be an inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Based on this understanding, the initial therapeutic strategies were directed at immune modulation and inflammation control. These approaches, including high-dose corticosteroids for acute relapses and the long-term use of parenteral interferon-β, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab for disease modification, are at best moderately effective.

Growing evidence supports that, while an inflammatory pathology characterizes the early relapsing stage of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative pathology dominates the later progressive stage of the disease. Multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies currently in development attempt to specifically target the underlying pathology at each stage of the disease while avoiding frequent self-injection. These include a variety of oral medications and monoclonal antibodies to reduce inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis and agents intended to promote neuroprotection and neurorepair in progressive multiple sclerosis.

Although newer therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis have the potential to be more effective and easier to administer, they also carry greater risks. Effective treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis are still being sought.

### Identification and management of subclinical disease activity in early multiple sclerosis: A review [^115exA7U]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Definitions of disease activity weave into the overall framework of managing multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is diagnosed according to the most recent version of the McDonald criteria. This requires confirmation of central nervous system (CNS) disease disseminated in time and space, as demonstrated by clinical attacks, examination features, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The McDonald criteria and its subsequent revisions have helped decrease delays in diagnosis, notably among children, adolescents, and younger adults. Clinical relapses and MRI disease activity are prioritized in the most recent criteria.

Although the 2017 updates to the McDonald criteria aimed to provide guidance to avoid the misdiagnosis of MS, it is important to acknowledge that misdiagnosis remains a concern in clinical practice. One 2019 study found that approximately 1 in 5 patients with a diagnosis of MS did not actually meet the diagnosis criteria upon reevaluation at an MS subspecialty center. The proper application of the McDonald criteria is critical for a correct diagnosis of MS, as patients receiving a misdiagnosis of MS may be exposed to unnecessary risks when incorrectly prescribed disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and may incur considerable financial burden.

Disease activity in clinical guidelines is emphasized by practice guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, which measure disease activity by clinical relapses or new MRI lesions, and these assessments are used to guide MS monitoring and treatment. Similarly, treatment guidelines from the European Committee of Treatment and Research in MS and the European Academy of Neurology describe disease activity in patients accurately.

### Multiple sclerosis: Early indicators of disease and assessing future risk [^114KAv4b]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

With a wide spectrum of MS disease activity, the identification of early clinical indicators for disease severity warrants close investigation to help guide surveillance and management. In particular, the clinical predictors of aggressive multiple sclerosis — where disability is accrued at an accelerated rate — are not well understood. This study, therefore, aimed to identify early clinical markers, present within the first year of disease, which would indicate an aggressive disease trajectory.

Patients were included in the study if the following criteria were met: (1) a diagnosis of clinically definite relapse-onset multiple sclerosis; (2) age at onset ≥ 18 years; (3) first EDSS recorded within 12 months of symptom onset; (4) at least two recorded EDSS scores within 10 years of symptom onset; and (5) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having aggressive multiple sclerosis if they met all three of the following criteria: (1) EDSS ≥ 6 within 10 years of symptom onset; (2) EDSS ≥ 6 confirmed and sustained over ≥ 6 months; and (3) EDSS ≥ 6 sustained until the end of follow-up (≥ 10 years).

Clinical predictors included patient variables such as sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit, and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel–bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalization). For the initial analysis, patient data were obtained from the established international MS database.

### Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: progress and challenges [^115yeq7M]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on neurological symptoms and signs, alongside evidence of dissemination of CNS lesions in space and time. MRI is often sufficient to confirm the diagnosis when characteristic lesions accompany a typical clinical syndrome, but in some patients, further supportive information is obtained from cerebrospinal fluid examination and neurophysiological testing. Differentiation is important from other diseases in which demyelination is a feature (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and from non-demyelinating disorders such as chronic small vessel disease and other inflammatory, granulomatous, infective, metabolic, and genetic causes that can mimic multiple sclerosis.

Advances in MRI and serological and genetic testing have greatly increased accuracy in distinguishing multiple sclerosis from these disorders, but misdiagnosis can occur. In this series paper, we explore the progress and challenges in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with reference to diagnostic criteria, important differential diagnoses, controversies and uncertainties, and future prospects.

### Disease-modifying therapies in managing disability worsening in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis: A longitudinal analysis of global and national registries [^112Uscr7]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

High-efficacy disease-modifying therapies have been proven to slow disability accrual in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, their impact on disability worsening in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis, particularly during the early phases, is not well understood. We evaluated how high-efficacy therapies influence transitions across five disability states, ranging from minimal disability to gait impairment and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, in people with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis.

- **Methods**: Longitudinal data were obtained from the international MSBase registry, containing data from people with multiple sclerosis from 151 centres across 41 countries, and the Italian Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders Register, containing data from people with multiple sclerosis from 178 Italian multiple sclerosis centres. People younger than 18 years at the onset of multiple sclerosis symptoms were included, provided they had a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and at least four Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores recorded within 12-month intervals.

The primary outcome was the time to change in disability state: minimal disability (EDSS scores 0, 1.0, and 1.5), mild disability (EDSS scores 2.0 and 2.5), moderate disability (EDSS scores 3.0 and 3.5), gait impairment (EDSS scores ≥ 4.0), and clinician-diagnosed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. A multi-state model was constructed to simulate the natural course of multiple sclerosis, modelling the probabilities of disability worsening.

### Earlier and more frequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using the McDonald criteria [^116sg4oB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

One potential limitation of our study is an over-representation of patients with optic neuritis, which may have a more benign prognosis than other CIS types. However, almost 80% of patients with optic neuritis had baseline MRI abnormalities, indicating a group at high risk for developing MS.

In conclusion, the McDonald criteria allow MS to be diagnosed sooner and more often in patients with CIS. While the McDonald criteria facilitate an earlier diagnosis of MS, up to a third of patients with CIS who satisfy the 2010 criteria do not have further clinical events, at least in the medium term.

### Early treatment in multiple sclerosis [^1175SSiP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

There is now a consensus that early treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is desirable, mainly because early treatment may delay the accumulation of disability. Disease-modifying treatments seem to be more effective when started early in the course of the disease. In particular, all first-line disease-modifying treatments have also been shown to be effective in treating clinically isolated syndrome. The evidence for this comes from extensive experience in randomized controlled Phase III clinical trials.

Many patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome are at high risk of experiencing a second attack. Early treatment with all disease-modifying treatments has been shown to delay conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis when compared to late treatment. Some of these trials have completed five years of follow-up. While the evidence for early intervention is stronger than ever, it is worthwhile to consider its relevance to everyday clinical practice. In particular, it is important to determine which patients are the best candidates for early therapy and to evaluate the anticipated risks and benefits of choosing a given therapy for a given patient.

### Treating to target in multiple sclerosis: Do we know how to measure whether we hit it [^115rbv1u]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The rapidly evolving landscape of effective treatment options in multiple sclerosis has led to a shift of treatment objectives towards a treat-to-target approach, aiming to suppress disease activity below the level of detectability early during the disease. To enable treat-to-target, a thorough reappraisal of available outcome measures with respect to their ability in this regard is required.

To that end, we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of more than 1000 studies using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 methodology, focusing on underlying evidence as well as utility and implementability in clinical practice.

From there, we propose a set of measurable outcomes for everyday routine clinical practice as well as advanced/aspirational measurables requiring additional resources. We also outline remaining knowledge/technology gaps that need to be overcome to enable a treat-to-target approach.

This work provides the basis for an evidence-based definition of outcome targets for relevant stakeholders and regulatory authorities.

### Overview of treatment options in multiple sclerosis [^1154ECpB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that results in inflammation, demyelination, and axonal and neuronal loss. The typical course of MS involves symptom exacerbations followed by periods of remission; however, patients will eventually accrue disability from the exacerbations. Several drugs, including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, and fingolimod, are effective in lowering relapse rates and slowing the progression of MS. For patients with suboptimal response to medication, switching to another first- or second-line medication can be an effective strategy.

### Early recognition and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^111F9WRi]. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder associated with inflammation and demyelination in the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. Patients with MS may present with a wide range of clinical symptoms, either monofocal or multifocal, all of which are related to the central nervous system. Although several strategies for the early recognition of MS are available, diagnostic criteria call for MRI of the brain and spinal cord due to its specificity in identifying white matter lesions disseminated in time and space. The course of MS is unpredictable, but four clinical subtypes have been described: relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive, and progressive relapsing. Prevalence rates for MS vary depending on geography, and susceptibility for MS appears to be influenced by both environmental and genetic risk factors.

### Investigating whether dissemination in time is essential to diagnose relapsing multiple sclerosis [^114JPQ4m]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Among patients who had optic nerve evaluation (n = 112), the demographic profile was similar to the whole cohort, but there was a higher proportion of patients with a non-optic neuritis presentation (29% vs. 19%). Eighty-nine (79%) patients had optic nerve lesions. In the first cohort, 28 out of 42 (67%) patients had abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEPs): 24 out of 25 (96%) with optic neuritis and 4 out of 17 (24%) with non-optic neuritis presentations. In the second cohort, 61 out of 70 (87%) patients had abnormal orbital MRI. When the optic nerve was added as a fifth region, 100 (89%) patients had lesions in ≥ 2/5 regions, 82 (73%) patients had lesions in ≥ 3/5 regions, 57 (51%) patients had lesions in ≥ 4/5 regions, and 28 (25%) patients had lesions in all 5/5 regions.

Over a mean follow-up of 11.2 (SD 9.3) years, 187 (77%) patients were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) using the 2017 McDonald criteria, 119 (49%) patients had a second clinical attack, and 170 (70%) patients had a new T2 lesion(s) at follow-up. The median number of follow-up MRI scans was four (range 1–5) in the first cohort and three (range 1–4) for the second cohort. Among the 57 (23%) patients who did not develop MS, 52 (91%) had either normal MRI or involvement of a single CNS region, including 16 patients with optic neuritis evaluated with either VEPs (n = 6) or orbital MRI (n = 10). After a mean follow-up of 13.3 (SD 5.2) years in this group, the diagnosis remained "clinically isolated syndrome".

Thirty-nine (16%) patients received treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) before a second clinical attack, all of whom satisfied the 2017 McDonald criteria for a diagnosis.

### Multiple sclerosis with initial stroke-like clinicoradiologic features: Case report and literature review [^113sz5bJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old male presented with a sudden onset of persistent focal neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a non-enhancing white matter lesion that appeared hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence and diffusion-weighted imaging, while hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, corresponding to the patient's clinical features. A smaller subclinical lesion was also present.

The patient's history, radiographic findings, and initial hospital course, including response to treatment, appeared supportive of a stroke diagnosis. However, a rapid recovery from his severe neurological deficits and results of subsequent serologic testing strongly indicated a demyelinating condition. The onset of adolescent multiple sclerosis can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, especially when the initial demyelinating event resembles an acute stroke in clinical and radiographic presentation. Every effort should be made to distinguish these diagnoses as early as possible to ensure timely and appropriate management.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis [^114LvYAX]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e. occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart).

Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B12 deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g. Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g. sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome).

Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been identified to help manage the condition.

### Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis [^111dxJz6]. The Lancet Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

In 85% of young adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), onset is a subacute clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of the optic nerves, brainstem, or spinal cord. Methods of assessing the prognosis for patients who present with a CIS have been sought, because only 30–70% of patients with a CIS develop MS. When clinically silent brain lesions are seen on MRI, the likelihood of developing MS is high. MS can be diagnosed within three months of CIS presentation with certain MRI and CSF criteria. Disability from MS is less likely in patients with a CIS of optic neuritis or sensory symptoms only, few or no MRI lesions, a long period to the first relapse, and no disability after the first five years. Development of more reliable prognostic markers will enable new treatments to be targeted for those who are most likely to benefit. We encourage continued clinical and laboratory assessment of patients with a CIS.

### Acute vision loss [^113zADiS]. Primary Care (2015). High credibility.

Acute vision loss can arise from several causes, including posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and giant cell arteritis. Other potential causes are migraine, vitreous hemorrhage, pituitary apoplexy, hyphema, central retinal vein occlusion, and central retinal artery occlusion. Conditions such as retinal detachment, acute angle-closure glaucoma, uveitis, and the presence of a corneal foreign body are also associated with acute vision loss. Additional causes include endophthalmitis, papillitis, keratitis, corneal opacity, amaurosis fugax, acute ischemic stroke, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Methanol poisoning, acute macular neuroretinopathy, acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, functional visual loss, ocular migraine, retinal migraine, toxic optic neuropathy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy further contribute to the list of potential causes.

### Clinical reasoning: A 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^113AnZ4Q]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions.

The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed.

This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

Regarding the medical management of multiple sclerosis, more specifically concerning disease-modifying therapies, the AAN 2018 guidelines recommend the following pretreatment counseling topics for patients with MS:

- **Specific treatment options**: A dedicated treatment visit is advised for discussing disease-modifying therapies.

- **Purpose of therapies**: Disease-modifying therapies are prescribed to reduce relapses and new MRI lesion activity but not for symptom improvement.

- **Risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: This risk is associated with natalizumab, fingolimod, rituximab, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate.

- **Undefined risks**: Potential risks of malignancy and infection are associated with new disease-modifying therapies that lack long-term safety data.

- **Comorbidities and interactions**: Consideration of comorbidities, adverse health behaviors, and potential interactions of the disease-modifying therapy with concomitant medications is crucial.

### A novel eye-movement impairment in multiple sclerosis indicating widespread cortical damage [^113wYi2y]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

In multiple sclerosis, remyelination trials have yet to deliver success like that achieved for relapse rates with disease course-modifying treatment trials. The challenge is to have a clinical, functional outcome measure. Currently, there are none that have been validated, other than visual evoked potentials in optic neuritis. Like vision, quick eye movements (saccades) are heavily dependent on myelination. We proposed that it is possible to extrapolate from demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the brainstem to quantitative assessment of cortical networks governing saccadic eye movements in multiple sclerosis. We have developed and validated a double-step saccadic test, which consists of a pair of eye movements towards two stimuli presented in quick succession (the demonstrate eye movement networks with saccades protocol).

In this single-centre, cross-sectional cohort study, we interrogated the structural and functional relationships of double-step saccades in multiple sclerosis. Data were collected for double-step saccades, cognitive function (extended Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery), disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale), and visual functioning in daily life (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire). MRI was used to quantify grey matter atrophy and multiple sclerosis lesion load. Multivariable linear regression models were used for analysis of the relationships between double-step saccades and clinical and MRI metrics.

We included 209 individuals with multiple sclerosis (mean age 54.3 ± 10.5 years, 58% female, 63% relapsing-remitting).

Krabbe disease is a rare autosomal recessive leucodystrophy, with less than 5% of cases exhibiting an adolescent-onset form. A 30-year-old woman, presenting a history of a subacute episode of gait impairment at 14 years of age and mild spastic paraparesis since then, was initially diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. After 10 years of slow disease progression without response to treatment, the initial diagnosis was reconsidered. An extensive metabolic workup revealed decreased activity of galactocerebrosidase. Genetic testing of the GALC gene confirmed the diagnosis of Krabbe disease and identified a novel mutation. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a critical perspective in the initial differential diagnosis, particularly in the presence of atypical findings.

### Novel therapeutics in multiple sclerosis management: Clinical applications [^111GMzqe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects an estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States. No cure exists and although there is a lack of consensus on management, strategies to modify disease course are available. These strategies involve initiating disease-modifying therapies that have been found to slow disease progression and prevent disability symptoms, thereby improving function for MS patients. The overall goal of early disease management is to intervene prior to irreversible neuronal destruction in order to delay disability progression and improve quality of life. Maintaining a lower level of disability for a longer period of time postpones and ultimately attempts to prevent reaching a level of immobility and irreversible disability.

However, due to the complex nature of disease and its unique, individual patient course, no patient can be treated alike and no patient responds to therapy similarly. Therefore, MS research is continuous in its evolution of therapeutic development, focusing on neuroprotective effects and agents with distinctive mechanisms of action allowing for unique safety and efficacy profiles. Investigations include novel oral agents and monoclonal antibodies. Many of the approved agents also are continually being investigated in order to evaluate comparative data, the most appropriate means of implementing subsequent therapy upon failure, responsiveness to therapeutic agent when switched, and long-term safety and efficacy. This multimedia webcast educational activity will cover the state of MS science, therapies in MS, and emerging treatments.

### Defining secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [^111ynbat]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

A number of studies have been conducted with the onset of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis as an inclusion criterion or an outcome of interest. However, a standardized objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of an objective definition for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, to enable comparability of future research studies.

Using MSBase, a large, prospectively acquired, global cohort study, we analyzed the accuracy of 576 data-derived onset definitions for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and first compared these to a consensus opinion of three neurologists. All definitions were then evaluated against 5-year disease outcomes post-assignment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: sustained disability, subsequent sustained progression, positive disability trajectory, and accumulation of severe disability. The five best performing definitions were further investigated for their timeliness and overall disability burden. A total of 17,356 patients were analyzed.

The best definition included a 3-strata progression magnitude in the absence of a relapse, confirmed after 3 months within the leading Functional System, and required an Expanded Disability Status Scale step ≥ 4 and pyramidal score ≥ 2. It reached an accuracy of 87% compared to the consensus diagnosis. Seventy-eight percent of the identified patients showed a positive disability trajectory and 70% reached significant disability after 5 years.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis — many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort organized by The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008 provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings, termed red flags, suggestive of alternative diagnoses.

Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, CNS inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings. Studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted.

Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### Treatment of multiple sclerosis: A review [^112PkAjq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, and the leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults. Effective management requires a multifaceted approach to control acute attacks, manage progressive worsening, and remediate bothersome or disabling symptoms associated with this illness.

Remarkable advances in the treatment of all forms of MS, especially for relapsing disease, have favorably changed the long-term outlook for many patients. There has also been a conceptual shift in understanding the immune pathology of MS, moving away from a purely T-cell-mediated model to the recognition that B cells have a key role in pathogenesis. The emergence of higher-efficacy drugs, which require less frequent administration, has made these preferred options in terms of tolerability and adherence. Many experts now recommend using these as first-line treatment for many patients with early disease, before permanent disability is evident.

### Maximizing therapeutic outcomes in patients failing on current therapy [^113YPxKr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The different immunomodulatory treatments available to patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis are only partially effective. Since these treatments are most effective in the early relapsing stage of the disease, it is important to adjust therapy in a timely fashion to fall within the window of opportunity when maximal benefit can be gained from a second-line treatment.

Consensus guidelines have been established to define a sub-optimal treatment response. Switching to another class of immunomodulatory therapy represents a logical treatment strategy in patients who fail to respond adequately to first-line treatments. Several observational studies have now shown such a strategy to be beneficial. Disease control can be improved following switching in patients with persistent relapse activity on first-line treatment. In patients experiencing intolerable side-effects to first-line treatment, tolerability can be improved by switching without loss of disease control. In particular, a switch between different classes of immunomodulatory treatments seems to be more beneficial than switching within the same class.

Formal switching algorithms need to be developed to ensure that all patients who could benefit from such an approach are managed in a timely and optimal manner.

### Comorbidity in multiple sclerosis: Implications for patient care [^111uDZem]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Most efforts aimed at understanding the notable heterogeneity of outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) have focused on disease-specific factors, such as symptoms at initial presentation, initial relapse rate, and age at symptom onset. These factors, however, explain relatively little of the heterogeneity of disease outcomes. Owing to the high prevalence of comorbidity in MS and the potential for its prevention or treatment, comorbidity is of rising interest as a factor that could explain the heterogeneity of outcomes. A rapidly growing body of evidence suggests that comorbidity adversely affects outcomes throughout the disease course in MS, including diagnostic delays from symptom onset, disability at diagnosis and subsequent progression, cognition, mortality, and health-related quality of life. Therefore, clinicians need to incorporate the prevention and management of comorbidity when treating patients with MS, but managing comorbidities in MS successfully may require the adoption of new collaborative models of care.

### Diagnosis and treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis: A position paper [^115XLRYY]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease characterized by a highly variable disease onset and clinical course. Three main phenotypes have been described: (1) relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) is defined by acute relapses interspersed with periods of full or partial recovery and stable clinical status. At disease onset, most patients have relapses with focal neurological deficits followed by complete or partial remission. RRMS is the most common phenotype, affecting 85% of all patients; (2) primary progressive MS (PPMS), which progresses continuously from onset of clinically manifest disease, typically with no relapses but possible periods of plateauing, and affects around 15% of MS patients; and (3) secondary progressive MS (SPMS), characterized by disease progression, with or without acute relapses, accumulating disability in ambulatory, autonomic, and cognitive functions. Up to 5% of patients may convert from RRMS to SPMS per year.

Distinguishing between progressive phenotypes of MS can be challenging for clinicians. PPMS is difficult to discern at the onset of neurological symptoms because it often requires several visits to a physician to establish the continuous worsening over time. Conversely, with SPMS it can be difficult to distinguish a permanent relapse‐related deficit from bona fide progression; furthermore, patients can progress independently of relapses. This can lead to long periods of uncertainty as patients transition from RRMS to SPMS.

The pathophysiological mechanisms associated with disease progression are probably present from disease onset.

### Recent developments in multiple sclerosis therapeutics [^117HFt53]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, the most common neurologic disorder of young adults, is traditionally considered to be an inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Based on this understanding, the initial therapeutic strategies were directed at immune modulation and inflammation control. These approaches, including high-dose corticosteroids for acute relapses and long-term use of parenteral interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab for disease modification, are at best moderately effective.

Growing evidence supports that, while an inflammatory pathology characterizes the early relapsing stage of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative pathology dominates the later progressive stage of the disease. Multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies currently in development attempt to specifically target the underlying pathology at each stage of the disease while avoiding frequent self-injection. These include a variety of oral medications and monoclonal antibodies to reduce inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis and agents intended to promote neuroprotection and neurorepair in progressive multiple sclerosis.

Although newer therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis have the potential to be more effective and easier to administer, they also carry greater risks. Effective treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis are still being sought.

### Association of initial disease-modifying therapy with later conversion to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [^115EYSLs]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

Within two decades of onset, 80% of untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) convert to a phase of irreversible disability accrual termed secondary progressive MS. The association between disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and this conversion has rarely been studied and never using a validated definition.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study utilized prospective data from 68 neurology centers in 21 countries. It examined patients with relapsing-remitting MS who commenced DMTs (or clinical monitoring) between 1988 and 2012 with a minimum of four years of follow-up.

- **Exposures**: The use, type, and timing of the following DMTs were examined: interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, or alemtuzumab. After propensity-score matching, 1,555 patients were included, with the last follow-up on February 14, 2017.

- **Main outcome and measure**: Conversion to objectively defined secondary progressive MS.

Results indicated that of the 1,555 patients, 1,123 were female with a mean baseline age of 35 years (SD, 10). Patients initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta had a lower hazard of conversion to secondary progressive MS than matched untreated patients (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.81; p < 0.001; 5-year absolute risk, 12% [49 of 407] vs. 27% [58 of 213]; median follow-up, 7.6 years [IQR, 5.8–9.6]), as did those treated with fingolimod (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.62; p < 0.001; 5-year absolute risk, 7% [6 of 85] vs. 32%).

### Site-specific clinical disease onset in multiple sclerosis [^112Ea64K]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by acute episodes of neurological dysfunction thought to reflect focal areas of demyelination occurring in clinically eloquent areas. These symptomatic relapses are generally considered to be random clinical events occurring without discernible pattern. The hypothesis that relapses may follow a predetermined sequence and provide insights into underlying pathological processes was investigated.

- **Methods**: Employing prospective clinical database data from 1,482 patients who had experienced one or more consecutive relapses were analyzed. Using regression analysis, site and symptom of the index event were compared with those of the first relapse.

- **Results**: It is demonstrated that following disease ignition, subsequent relapses may not be random events but dependent on characteristics of the index event. All anatomical sites were more likely to be affected in the first relapse if that site had been involved in the index event, with a similar association observed when comparing by symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: These findings are important in understanding the evolution of the disease and predicting individual disease progression and may aid with patient counseling and management.

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^114y7Dx8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

This pioneering investigation establishes a link between an individual's combined genetic susceptibility, as measured by the MS-GRS encompassing numerous MS-associated loci with common alleles, and the subsequent risk of MS development in those experiencing an initial episode of undifferentiated ON. Moreover, we unveil a stratification paradigm for individuals with undifferentiated ON, integrating the MS-GRS, age at ON onset, and sex, which delineates cohorts characterized by varying future MS risks: low (3.6%), intermediate (14.7%), higher (31.6%), and highest (41.2%). Significantly, our study demonstrates robustness through the successful replication and validation of the composite MS-GRS model across two distinct datasets from the United States and Finland, populations also predominantly of European ancestry.

While it has been long-established that ON may be the first presentation of MS, the additional risk stratification outlined in this study could valuably aid management of ON and greater international consensus on this, in the time-critical window before neuroimaging and serum and cerebrospinal fluid investigations are available. In usual clinical practice, European ancestry British women aged 18 to 50 years, who present with mild-moderate vision impairment, would not typically be offered corticosteroid therapy, and the MS-GRS would identify most of these individuals to be at enhanced MS genetic risk. Whereas, urgent corticosteroid therapy may be better targeted to the smaller number of individuals at low MS genetic risk, who are more likely to have an alternative diagnosis.

### Overview of the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and practical recommendations [^114usY3w]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The initial phases of the clinical course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a predominantly inflammatory pathology, which transitions to a largely neurodegenerative process as the disease evolves. As all currently available disease-modifying therapies aim to control inflammation, the window of opportunity for their use is early in the disease course, specifically at the time of a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS or in the early stages of relapsing-remitting MS. Approximately 30% of patients treated with first-line immunomodulators (interferon-β or glatiramer acetate) exhibit a suboptimal response during the first 1–2 years and require a switch to an alternative therapy. It is recommended not to delay switching therapies to prevent disease progression. Patients with poor prognoses, in particular, may require a timely switch to a second-line agent.

Regular monitoring of disease and therapy in patients with MS is essential. In the first year after diagnosis, clinical evaluations (neurological status, symptomatic assessment, patient well-being) should be performed at baseline, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months, continuing every 6 months thereafter. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be conducted every 6 months during the first year of treatment and at least once yearly thereafter. A spinal cord MRI should be performed annually in patients presenting with spinal symptoms.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment response, the AAN 2018 guidelines recommend monitoring MRI disease activity from the clinical onset of the disease. This is crucial in detecting the accumulation of new lesions, which in turn informs treatment decisions in patients with MS who are on disease-modifying therapies.

### Current and emerging disease-modulatory therapies and treatment targets for multiple sclerosis [^115fCNEc]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In most patients, multiple sclerosis (MS) starts as a relapsing–remitting disease (RRMS), which is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) following a first bout of clinical symptoms. This is often preceded by a phase of subclinical disease activity that can be detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; yellow stars denote MRI signs of active inflammation). In later stages of RRMS, patients accumulate persistent disabilities, where recent evidence suggests that a progressive component may start already soon after diagnosis (light grey). This underlying progressive disease component becomes more pronounced at later stages, when the disease converts to secondary progressive MS (SPMS).

The fact that inflammatory disease activity, as reflected by frequency of bouts or MRI activity, diminishes over time suggests a shift from adaptive to innate or local disease mechanisms, which may explain the relative loss of efficacy of disease‐modulatory treatments (DMT).

### Permeability of the blood-brain barrier predicts conversion from optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis [^115yRQaZ]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

The cumulative incidence of conversion from optic neuritis to multiple sclerosis is depicted in a diagram showing the timing of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and the initiation of first-line disease-modifying treatment, specifically interferon beta 1a. Notably, all patients were untreated at the onset of optic neuritis (ON). The decision to initiate treatment was made either as a preventative measure or following an MS diagnosis by specialist doctors in multiple sclerosis and was not influenced by the study. A red asterisk indicates that a patient started disease-modifying treatment concurrently with an MS diagnosis. A blue asterisk indicates that a patient began preventative disease-modifying treatment 2–6 weeks after optic neuritis onset.

### CIS case studies [^1164AwqG]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The onset of multiple sclerosis presents in 85% of cases as a subacute clinical event, the so-called clinically isolated syndrome. This event involves either focal or multifocal brain regions, most frequently the optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord. The initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis necessitates the demonstration of dissemination of pathology in time and space, as well as the exclusion of other alternative diagnoses, and can be challenging. Confirming a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is a sensitive time for both the patient and physician. The patient is faced with a difficult diagnosis, and the physician must consider making difficult treatment decisions regarding therapy and follow-up care. This article presents a number of case studies that illustrate the diversity of presentation of clinically isolated syndrome and the challenges associated with confirming a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

### The apparently milder course of multiple sclerosis: Changes in the diagnostic criteria, therapy and natural history [^116JYWyD]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

In the past decade, changes have occurred in the spectrum of multiple sclerosis courses. The natural history of multiple sclerosis appears milder from the first sign of demyelinating disease to the progressive course, probably due to an interplay between several factors including changes in the diagnostic criteria, changes in the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis, impact of early and appropriate disease-modifying treatment, and overall improvements in the general state of health in the population.

It has been suggested to regard incidental findings of demyelinating lesions in MRI in individuals without any history of clinical symptoms consistent with neurological dysfunction, known as radiological isolated syndrome, as the initial course of multiple sclerosis. New diagnostic criteria have enabled the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in many patients at the first clinical demyelinating event, known as clinically isolated syndrome. The remaining patients with clinically isolated syndrome have a more benign prognosis, and for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the prognosis has become more favorable.

Reduced disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can partly be attributed to more efficacious new disease-modifying therapies; however, a decrease in disease activity has also been observed in placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. This may be explained by several factors: changes in the diagnostic criteria, more explicit inclusion criteria, exclusion of high-risk patients (e.g. patients with co-morbidities), and more rigorous definitions of relapses and disease worsening.

### Access to therapy for children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis: Global considerations in preventing disease progression [^113DQqz3]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis comprises approximately 1.5% of prevalent multiple sclerosis cases. It is associated with a higher disease burden, early and progressive motor and cognitive disability in young adulthood, and high levels of depression and fatigue. Observational data and randomized controlled trials have shown marked effects of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on MRI activity and long-term outcomes, including disease progression, in the pediatric population.

We present a comprehensive review of published literature focused on issues of access to therapy in children and adolescents with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis. In this review, we identify regional variability in the availability of multiple sclerosis therapies and examine issues such as differences in access to care, time to diagnosis, criteria for regulatory approval, availability of insurance, and government supports. Finally, we outline specific future directions that should be taken to address these barriers and ensure better and equal therapy access for all children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis.

### A changing treatment landscape for multiple sclerosis: challenges and opportunities [^115SvX9z]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system but also encompasses prominent neurodegenerative aspects. A significant proportion of MS patients will develop neurological disability over time, and up until recently, treatment options have been limited. However, MS treatment is now at a stage of rapid progress, with several new drugs that have reached the market or will be launched in the near future. This provides new opportunities for individualized treatment, but also creates new challenges regarding the monitoring of disease activity, long-term safety issues, and efficacy, particularly in patients with progressive disease.

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^111n7tpA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Further research is needed to test the hypothesis that an MS-GRS, combined with existing diagnostic, demographic, and other deep phenotypic variables, can usefully stratify patients with undifferentiated ON into high/medium/low genetic MS risk in a prospective diagnostic predictive clinical setting. Patient and public involvement around the acceptability of integrating genetic risk stratification into frontline care will be vital. Our study hints at the possibility of clinical translation, with the use of a genetic test at first ON presentation to deliver better acute clinical care. With up to 5 million adults in the UK soon to be recruited into the UK's largest-ever health research programme, including genomic medicine, 'Our Future Health', the use of GRSs could soon become part of an enhanced approach to personalised medicine.

In summary, our study unveils the potential of a composite model that integrates MS-GRS with age at ON onset and sex, offering a means to stratify patients based on their likelihood of a future MS diagnosis, thus providing valuable insights for clinical management decisions. Future research endeavours should delve into the practical application of the MS-GRS model within clinical settings. We hypothesize that the knowledge of high MS-GRS, especially in individuals with suspected clinically isolated syndrome, would facilitate MS follow-up management and guide decisions around performing lumbar puncture to seek earlier MS diagnosis and potentially earlier disease-modifying treatment to reduce relapse rate.

### Evolution of retinal degeneration and prediction of disease activity in relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis [^113VZt9W]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All patients underwent physical, neurological, and OCT examinations at baseline and at each follow-up time point at one of the five participating MS centers. The following data were recorded: sex, date of birth, date of manifestation of patients' first symptoms, EDSS scores, episodes of ON, DMTs, occurrence of relapses, and brain and spinal MRI progression/activity (new and enlarging T2-weighted/gadolinium-enhancing lesions).

EDSS scores were always assessed by the same team of specially trained neurologists at each participating center during the same visit as the OCT. Researchers and technical assistants performing the OCT analysis were masked to EDSS results, and those assessing disability by EDSS were masked to the OCT results at the time of the examination. Disease duration was defined as the time between the manifestation of first symptoms and the date of the OCT examination. Disability worsening was determined by a documented increase in EDSS score compared to the previous measurement (≥ 1.0 point when the EDSS score was < 6.0, or ≥ 0.5 point if the EDSS score was ≥ 6.0) at a single time point. The EDSS increase did not have to be sustained. History of ON was assessed by the medical history and using the previously described OCT approach, based on inter-eye GCIPL thickness difference of ≥ 4 μm.

### Assessing risks of multiple sclerosis therapies [^115rjsyf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, thanks to the discovery of several pharmaceutical agents, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been transformed into a treatable disorder, although the degree of therapeutic response may vary considerably. As more medications enter the MS market, clinicians face the mounting challenge of comparing the risk and benefit profiles of various agents to find the best treatment approach for each individual patient. In this review, we aim to summarize the available data on the safety profiles of available MS therapies, focusing mostly on serious medication-specific potential adverse events without discussing the teratogenic potential of each agent unless there is a black box warning or hypersensitivity reactions. Our goal is to provide clinicians with guidance on ensuring appropriate safety monitoring for patients treated with one of the agents discussed. We also comment on the future of risk management in MS and discuss possible enhancements to the model of the drug approval process and general strategies to improve patient safety.

### De-escalating and discontinuing disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^116X2Ezj]. Brain (2025). High credibility.

Beyond the optimal selection of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), there is a need for de-escalation algorithms that justify regular reassessment of treatment plans with the aim of reducing treatment intensity or even discontinuing treatment if the benefit-risk ratio becomes less favorable. Understanding the principles, challenges, and evolving evidence surrounding de-escalation strategies is paramount to optimizing long-term outcomes, mitigating risks, and improving the quality of life for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). At the time of writing, however, there is no consensus on the strategies of de-escalation or discontinuation, while a similar concept has been discussed more extensively in other fields, such as rheumatology and oncology.

To fill this gap, the 2023 Annual Focused Workshop, organized by the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), brought together a panel of international experts to review and discuss the evidence on de-escalating DMTs in MS. The aim of this workshop was to provide evidence-based practical recommendations for the management and monitoring of de-escalating DMTs.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: Diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^117PeKEm]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Management of acute relapses of MS and IU: In the acute setting, MS relapses and sight-threatening inflammation in IU are both managed with corticosteroids. Oral or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone will shorten the duration of an MS relapse but does not have any meaningful impact on long-term neurodisability. Systemic steroids are used to treat acute relapses of IU; however, unlike with MS, intraocular inflammation is amenable to local therapy. Topical steroid drops do not penetrate the posterior segment of the eye, but periocular steroid injections or intravitreal injection of steroid implant are viable alternatives, which avoid the side effects of systemic corticosteroids. Moreover, the effects of intravitreal steroid implants can last up to 6 months.

Important considerations include the possible complications of corticosteroid treatment and how they may be distinguished from relapses of MS or IU. Corticosteroids can cause systemic symptoms that may be confused with progressive neurodisability from MS. Likewise, frequent or chronic treatment with local or systemic corticosteroids can cause sight-threatening complications, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).

Cataracts cause a progressive reduction in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, night vision, and color perception, which might be confused with optic neuropathy. Nevertheless, cataracts are not a contraindication to steroid treatment, and cataract surgery will restore vision. Glaucoma also causes insidious visual loss that is largely asymptomatic until advanced. It is a progressive optic neuropathy that is distinguished by its subtle manifestation.
