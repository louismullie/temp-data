## Question

Can u send me a prescription

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether I can send a prescription. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether I, as an AI, have the legal authority to prescribe. Then, I should verify the regulatory framework that governs who can prescribe and how prescriptions must be transmitted. Next, I will consider legitimate pathways to obtain prescriptions, including telemedicine and electronic prescribing. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, actionable answer and provide safety guidance and next steps, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the core issue: I do not have a medical license and therefore cannot legally prescribe medications, and this is a hard constraint across jurisdictions. Prescribing requires a licensed clinician, and I am not a licensed clinician, so I cannot send a prescription myself [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory framework so I don't overgeneralize. In the U.S., prescribing is governed by state medical boards and the DEA for controlled substances, and only licensed physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and in some states pharmacists under collaborative agreements can prescribe, with telemedicine rules varying by state and by controlled versus non-controlled status. I should confirm that even with telehealth, a licensed prescriber must evaluate the patient and issue the order, which remains the case [^36f79449] [^4d476918].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about telemedicine. I need to check whether direct-to-consumer telehealth platforms can legally prescribe. Yes, many telehealth companies employ licensed clinicians who can prescribe after appropriate evaluation, but they must follow state laws and federal rules such as the Ryan Haight Act for controlled substances, and they cannot delegate prescribing to non-clinicians like me. So a legitimate telehealth visit with a licensed provider is a valid path to a prescription, but I still cannot personally send one [^8f1e8f7c] [^36f79449].

> I should double-check the mechanics of how prescriptions are transmitted. Modern prescribing relies on electronic prescribing systems that send prescriptions directly to pharmacies, which improves safety and reduces errors compared with paper. This is the standard in many health systems and is the mechanism a licensed prescriber would use, not something I can initiate as an AI [^ec49fd07] [^337543ec].

> Let me consider what to do next. If you need a prescription, the appropriate next step is to contact a licensed healthcare provider, either your primary care clinician or a legitimate telemedicine service, where a clinician can assess your condition and, if indicated, send an electronic prescription to your pharmacy. I should confirm that this aligns with best practices for safe, evidence-based prescribing and patient-centered care [^b91be893] [^8f1e8f7c].

> But wait, what if you're asking because you're traveling or need urgent access? I need to ensure I give practical advice. For travel, the CDC recommends preparing 4–6 weeks ahead, securing enough medication for the trip plus extras, and carrying prescriptions in hand luggage; if you run out, seek local care rather than attempting to obtain medications without a valid prescription, which is unsafe and may be illegal [^f8bee9f0] [^5859fe6b].

> I should also emphasize safety and stewardship. Prescriptions should be individualized to your diagnosis, comedications, allergies, and comorbidities, and clinicians should follow indication-based prescribing and deprescribing principles to avoid inappropriate medication use. That level of clinical judgment is why prescriptions require a licensed evaluator, not an AI [^b2355ea5] [^18e95ad5].

> In summary, I cannot send you a prescription because I am not a licensed prescriber. Please contact a licensed clinician or a reputable telehealth service to obtain a proper evaluation and, if appropriate, a prescription that will be sent electronically to your pharmacy. If you tell me your condition and location, I can suggest condition-specific next steps or telehealth options, but I will not and cannot provide a prescription myself [^36f79449] [^ec49fd07].

I can't prescribe or send prescriptions because I'm not a licensed clinician. Please see a doctor or use a legitimate telehealth service to get a prescription. If you need help finding care or have questions about a medication, I can guide you to safe, evidence-based resources.

## Legal and ethical considerations

- **Licensure requirements**: Prescribing medications requires a valid medical license, which I do not possess [^notfound].
- **Regulatory compliance**: Prescribing must adhere to strict legal and ethical standards, including patient assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring — tasks only licensed clinicians can perform [^b91be893].
- **Patient safety**: Unauthorized prescribing poses significant risks, including incorrect dosing, drug interactions, and inadequate monitoring [^8fc1cbee].

---

## Risks of unauthorized prescribing

- **Incorrect medication or dosage**: Without a thorough medical evaluation, there is a high risk of prescribing inappropriate medications or incorrect dosages [^b91be893].
- **Drug interactions**: Unauthorized prescribers may not adequately consider potential drug interactions, leading to serious adverse effects [^ed33ae67].
- **Lack of monitoring**: Proper prescribing involves ongoing monitoring of patient response and side effects, which cannot be adequately performed without direct patient care [^b91be893].

---

## Appropriate channels for obtaining prescriptions

Patients should obtain prescriptions through **licensed healthcare providers**, such as:

- **Primary care physicians**: Regular healthcare providers who can assess, diagnose, and prescribe appropriate medications [^b91be893].
- **Specialists**: Medical specialists who can provide specialized care and prescribe medications specific to their field of expertise.
- **Telemedicine services**: Legitimate telehealth platforms that connect patients with licensed clinicians for remote consultations and prescriptions [^8f1e8f7c].

---

## Role of telemedicine

Telemedicine has become an increasingly popular and effective way to access healthcare services, including prescription medications. Legitimate telemedicine platforms connect patients with **licensed clinicians** who can conduct thorough evaluations, diagnose conditions, and prescribe appropriate medications. These services adhere to strict regulatory standards and ensure patient safety [^8f1e8f7c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

I cannot prescribe or send prescriptions because I am not a licensed clinician. Patients should obtain prescriptions through **licensed healthcare providers** or legitimate telemedicine services. This approach ensures patient safety, regulatory compliance, and appropriate medical care. If you need assistance finding a healthcare provider or telemedicine service, I can help guide you to appropriate resources.

### Deciding the dose to prescribe [^0bb39849]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

The dose of a medicine prescribed is so much a part of everyday practice and prescribing guidance that it might appear a surprising subject for a symposium. In reality, however, many questions about choosing doses are unresolved. Here we summarise the talks given at our March 2004 symposium — Deciding the dose to prescribe — incorporating views raised in discussion.

### Glatiramer acetate (glatopa) [^a9febdc5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Glatopa may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Glatopa works.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I use Glatopa?

For detailed instructions, see the Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for complete information on how to use Glatopa.
Your doctor will tell you how much Glatopa to use and when to use it.
Glatopa is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneously).
Use Glatopa exactly as your doctor tells you to use it.
Since every body type is different, talk with your doctor about the injection areas that are best for you.
You should receive your first dose of Glatopa with a doctor or nurse present. This might be at your doctor's office or with a visiting home health nurse who will teach you how to give your Glatopa injections.

What are the possible side effects of Glatopa?

Glatopa may cause serious side effects, including:

Immediate Post-Injection Reactions. Serious side effects may happen right after or within minutes after you inject Glatopa at any time during your course of treatment. Call your doctor right away if you have any of these immediate post-injection reaction symptoms including:
redness to your cheeks or other parts of the body (flushing)
chest pain
fast heart beat
anxiety
breathing problems or tightness in your throat
swelling, rash, hives, or itching
If you have symptoms of an immediate post-injection reaction, do not give yourself more injections until a doctor tells you to.
Chest Pain. You can have chest pain as part of an immediate post-injection reaction or by itself. This type of chest pain usually lasts a few minutes and can begin around 1 month after you start using Glatopa. Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain while using Glatopa.
Damage to your skin. Damage to the fatty tissue just under your skin's surface (lipoatrophy) and, rarely, death of your skin tissue (necrosis) can happen when you use Glatopa. Damage to the fatty tissue under your skin can cause a "dent" at the injection site that may not go away. You can reduce your chance of developing these problems by:
following your doctor's instructions for how to use Glatopa
choosing a different injection area each time you use Glatopa. See Step 4 in the Instructions for Use, "Choose your injection area".
Liver problems. Liver problems, including liver failure, can occur with Glatopa. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms, such as:

### Drug advertising: the right or wrong prescription for our ailments? [^19428572]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

As the cost of health care — particularly prescription drugs — is rising at a rate that has not been seen in a decade, the United States finds itself once again searching for new solutions to what has, until now, been an intractable problem. Drug advertising, which has almost become part of the social fabric in the United States, is an appealing and visible target. Critics point to pharmaceutical companies boosting profits by pitching pills, whereas advocates talk of empowering patients with information. With a topic that is so dominated by money and politics, it is sometimes hard to tell who is correct.

### Patient and family perceptions of the provision of medicines as part of virtual outpatient consultations for children during COVID-19 pandemic [^337543ec]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Need for electronic processes to send prescriptions to local pharmacies

The need for electronic processes to send prescriptions to local pharmacies was highlighted by both parents and healthcare professionals especially as we move towards hybrid models of care.

A minority of families reported concerns for the current process and its feasibility as the country comes out of national lockdown and people return to school and work; deliveries from all three hospitals require a signature on receipt, which may not be practical. ' Perhaps the only disadvantage I could see is perhaps if I'm not actually at home at that present time, and I miss the delivery' [Hospital 3 parent].

The use of EPS by hospital staff to allow patients to have access to their medications directly from their local pharmacy could be a way forward, allowing medication to be obtained locally with F2F education provided by pharmacists. EPS is a national system that is used by GP's, urgent care centres and NHS 111 to send electronic prescriptions to the patient's nominated pharmacy. This system can now be adapted to allow hospitals to use EPS. From the interviews conducted, the advantage would be improved timeliness and convenience for patients' families while reducing burden on GPs.

### A qualitative exploration of the experiences of community dwelling older adults with sensory impairment / s receiving polypharmacy on their pharmaceutical care journey [^78d2a8a4]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 23 interviews were conducted with older people recruited from seven Scottish Health Board areas. Twelve participants had dual SI, 6 had VI and 5 had HI. Participant characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Interviews lasted on average for 28 ± 11 minutes.

Table 1.
Participants' characteristics

Three overarching themes were identified that reflected different stages of participants' pharmaceutical care journey, including facilitators and barriers for ordering and collection of prescriptions; medicine storage; and administration (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Stages of the pharmaceutical care journey of older people with sensory impairment.

Ordering and collecting prescriptions

Stage one of the pharmaceutical care journey describes participants' experiences with ordering and collecting their prescriptions from community pharmacies. The majority of participants regularly re-ordered their own prescriptions, usually contacting their General Practitioner (GP) and collected their prescription from the community pharmacist. Most participants telephoned for their repeat prescriptions, with some people using accessible technology, for example, large display screens or voice recognition.

'And now that you can order everything online which is very handy… I just go into patient access and it tells me when I last ordered it and all the information is on it which is very good… I mean I've got a 32 inch screen I use for my computer'.Participant 5, DSI

'I send an email to the [surgery]… and tell them what I want because I have got this wonderful thing on the computer that allows me to speak to it; I don't need to type'.Participant 8, VI

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^48d4c38a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^fc51f221]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NATPARA REMS

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]

NATPARA is available only through a restricted program called the NATPARA REMS Program, because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma.
Counsel patients on the benefits and risks of NATPARA using the NATPARA Patient Brochure.
Patients must sign the NATPARA REMS Patient-Prescriber Acknowledgment Form.
Provide patient with a copy of the NATPARA Patient Brochure and NATPARA REMS Patient-Prescriber Acknowledgment Form.
NATPARA is only available through certified pharmacies, provide information to your patients about how they will receive prescriptions:
Submit the NATPARA prescription to the NATPARA REMS Program Coordinating Center (by fax or email).
The REMS Program Coordinating Center will send the prescription to a certified pharmacy to fill after verifying that the prescriber is certified and a Patient-Prescriber Acknowledgment Form is on record.
The REMS Program Coordinating Center will call the patient and provide the name and phone number of the certified pharmacy that will be dispensing NATPARA.
The certified pharmacy will contact the patient to arrange the date to ship NATPARA once the prescription is filled.

Severe Hypercalcemia

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Instruct patients that severe hypercalcemia can occur when starting or adjusting NATPARA dose and/or when making changes to co-administered drugs known to raise serum calcium. Instruct patients to: report symptoms of hypercalcemia promptly, report any changes to co-administered drug(s) known to influence calcium levels and follow recommended serum calcium monitoring.

Severe Hypocalcemia

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

Instruct patients that severe hypocalcemia can occur if NATPARA dosing is abruptly interrupted or discontinued. Instruct patients to report symptoms of hypocalcemia promptly, report interruption in NATPARA dosing and follow recommended serum calcium monitoring. In the event of NATPARA dose interruption, patients should contact their healthcare provider, as their doses of active vitamin D and calcium supplementation may need adjustment.

Digoxin Toxicity

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

Instruct patients to report use of digoxin containing medication, and follow recommended serum calcium monitoring.

### The impact of a multi-faceted intervention on non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics by urban community pharmacies in Indonesia: a mixed methods evaluation [^79a5d362]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

While many pharmacists realised that giving non-prescription antibiotics was prohibited, they admitted to succumbing to pressure exerted by pharmacy owners to maximise sales: 'Well… I always say [to customers] they must come with a prescription, but my boss [the owner] objects. One time there was a customer who insisted and debated with me. Eventually, I got a warning — [the owner] sent me a warning letter' (278–1, pharmacist). Another interviewee said the owner gave them a particularly harsh warning: '… if you don't give antibiotics, you will receive no salary!' (403–1, pharmacist).

Interviewees reported that it was common for customers who were initially refused an antibiotic to push pharmacy staff to give them antibiotics. 'Sometimes I would offer them other alternative, but if they say, 'I want amoxicillin', they would refuse other drugs' (396–2, pharmacy staff). Interviewees also noted that some customers would bargain for lower dosages of antibiotics, send another family member to try and buy antibiotics without a prescription, or ask for antibiotic lozenges as a 'milder' form of antibiotic.

Some interviewees stated they were more inclined to give non-prescription antibiotics to customers showing signs of infection, needing antibiotics for children or older people, with a history of using the same antibiotic, employed as a health worker or claiming to have an old prescription at home. 'If they said that they have been prescribed before, I would give them [antibiotics]. But I would also mention that next time they should see a doctor first. Usually they argue that it is too far or closed on Sundays' (338–1, pharmacist).

Another reason given for dispensing non-prescription antibiotics was a lack of oversight from a qualified pharmacist. Despite regulations stipulating that antibiotics can only be dispensed by a pharmacist on presentation of a prescription, this was not always the case. A representative from the Ministry of Health said: 'For pharmacists, the big problem [in the pharmacy] is attendance. The attendance of pharmacists is not that good. There is an impression that pharmacists are not always present' (Ministry of Health staff).

### Exercise recommendation for people with bone metastases: expert consensus for health care providers and exercise professionals [^06172450]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The IBMEWG recommendation aims to move beyond the initial and restrictive approaches to exercise testing and prescription with the goal better informing the development of efficacious exercise prescriptions for people with bone metastases in the clinical setting. The standard approach to exercise prescription for people living with and beyond cancer as outlined by the International Exercise Guidelines for Cancer Survivors from the American College of Sports Medicineshould be used, with ongoing monitoring of individual response to adjust the exercise prescription or to send the person for further review. It was also deemed important to take additional guidance from exercise literature in osteoporosis that has sought to reduce the risk of skeletal-related complications, especially in vertebral bodies and hip. This includes an emphasis on correct technique and postural alignment with all exercises; avoidance of rapid or loaded end-range movements, such as rotation, flexion, or extension movements that involve the area of the lesions; consideration of impact loading of an exercise along with the type of movement (ie, concentric, eccentric, and plyometric) in the area of the bone lesion(s); and education and precautions to minimize the risk of falls. An additional consideration is that people with bone metastases may be deconditioned, because of treatment or higher symptom burden, and exercise volume should be adjusted accordingly.

### Predictors of discontinuation of benzodiazepine prescription after sending a letter to long-term benzodiazepine users in family practice [^b823e437]. Family Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Predictors of benzodiazepine discontinuation after sending a discontinuation letter by the family practitioner have not been established sufficiently.

Objective

To identify predictors of short- and long-term discontinuation of benzodiazepine use and relapse in use after a minimal intervention with a discontinuation letter followed by an offer for an evaluation consultation.

Methods

Predictors of benzodiazepine discontinuation and relapse in use were studied by logistic regression analysis and survival analysis within a family practice population of long-term benzodiazepine users (n = 1707) addressed by a discontinuation letter and followed for 21 months.

Results

A lower baseline prescription, a shorter duration of use, male gender and use of an agent with a half-life time < 24 hours were predictive of complete discontinuation in the short (6 months) and long term (21 months). Multiple agent use at baseline, use of antidepressants at 6 months and benzodiazepine type (anxiolytic/hypnotic) at baseline predicted relapse. Attendance at an evaluation consultation 3 months after the letter was sent was not predictive of discontinuation or relapse.

Conclusions

Amount of baseline use and duration of use are the main determinative characteristics of successful discontinuation. The discontinuation letter intervention is suitable for use with a broad group of long-term benzodiazepine users in family practice and can be used as a first step within a stepped care approach to decrease long-term benzodiazepine use.

Preparing for international travel for travelers with chronic illnesses — 4–6 WEEKS BEFORE TRAVEL: Attend an appointment with your healthcare professional and a travel medicine specialist; discuss Specific health conditions and how travel may affect them based upon travel destination, itinerary, and planned activities; Recommended prevention strategies, including vaccines, malaria prevention, medications, prescriptions, and other ways to prevent illness or injury; and Limiting travel to destinations or on cruise ships that have access to quality care for your condition. Contact the airline or cruise line to give advanced notice if you need special assistance, and identify healthcare professionals and pharmacies at your destination available to provide care if you are ill or injured.

### Alternatives to potentially inappropriate medications for use in e-prescribing software: triggers and treatment algorithms [^33f6f0a6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Physicians repeated over and over the need for the data to be accurate and useful, "It would depend on how reliable we would perceive that data to be. Judging from other insurance data we get, it's pretty poor in terms of the accuracy of that."

Another physician said, "Differentiate it from the usual. There's an interaction here, you know, non-steroidals and antihypertensives — we all know that. Quit doing that. It's annoying. Only if it's actually helpful. If this person has a serious side effect. And that's the only reason it (the alert) went up, and it really meant something, then yes (it's useful)."

A physician who approved of getting computer triggers nevertheless warned about ease of use,

I think that information would be extremely important… So I think the information would have to be readily available, not having to be looked for, not physician-dependent, it really needs to be something brought to me by the prescreening technicians, and that information is on the chart — 4/5 prescriptions filled, zero prescriptions filled… All I need is the data.

Some physicians felt that having medication-related triggers on the computer at the time of the visit would aid them in counselling patients who were non-adherent with their medication therapy,

"A lot of patients don't want to bother the doctor… So a patient comes in and we see that there's significant progression of their disease. So we're assuming they're not taking their medication till they come to the office, the night before. To make me happy. They're treating me, they're not treating themselves… There's some reason they're not telling me… So if we had some information that we could broach with them, and we could say 'Why aren't you filling your prescriptions?"

Of note, many of the physicians in the focus groups were not specifically aware or knowledgeable of the term, Beers criteria drugs, although they recognised that the drugs were older and less commonly prescribed.

### Effect of a pharmacist-led educational intervention on inappropriate medication prescriptions in older adults: the D-PRESCRIBE randomized clinical trial [^8fc1cbee]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

High rates of inappropriate prescribing persist among older adults in many outpatient settings, increasing the risk of adverse drug events and drug-related hospitalizations.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of a consumer-targeted, pharmacist-led educational intervention vs usual care on discontinuation of inappropriate medication among community-dwelling older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cluster randomized trial (D-PRESCRIBE [Developing Pharmacist-Led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly]) that recruited community pharmacies in Quebec, Canada, from February 2014 to September 2017, with follow-up until February 2018, and randomly allocated them to intervention or control groups. Patients included were adults aged 65 years and older who were prescribed 1 of 4 Beers Criteria medications (sedative-hypnotics, first-generation antihistamines, glyburide, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), recruited from 69 community pharmacies. Patients were screened and enrolled before randomization.

Interventions

Pharmacists in the intervention group were encouraged to send patients an educational deprescribing brochure in parallel to sending their physicians an evidence-based pharmaceutical opinion to recommend deprescribing. The pharmacists in the control group provided usual care. Randomization occurred at the pharmacy level, with 34 pharmacies randomized to the intervention group (248 patients) and 35 to the control group (241 patients). Patients, physicians, pharmacists, and evaluators were blinded to outcome assessment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Discontinuation of prescriptions for inappropriate medication at 6 months, ascertained by pharmacy medication renewal profiles.

Results

Among 489 patients (mean age, 75 years; 66% women), 437 (89%) completed the trial (219 [88%] in the intervention group vs 218 [91%] in the control group). At 6 months, 106 of 248 patients (43%) in the intervention group no longer filled prescriptions for inappropriate medication compared with 29 of 241 (12%) in the control group (risk difference, 31% [95% CI, 23% to 38%]). In the intervention vs control group, discontinuation of inappropriate medication occurred among 63 of 146 sedative-hypnotic drug users (43.2%) vs 14 of 155 (9.0%), respectively (risk difference, 34% [95% CI, 25% to 43%]); 19 of 62 glyburide users (30.6%) vs 8 of 58 (13.8%), respectively (risk difference, 17% [95% CI, 2% to 31%]); and 19 of 33 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users (57.6%) vs 5 of 23 (21.7%), respectively (risk difference, 35% [95% CI, 10% to 55%]) (P for interaction = .09). Analysis of the antihistamine drug class was not possible because of the small sample size (n = 12). No adverse events requiring hospitalization were reported, although 29 of 77 patients (38%) who attempted to taper sedative-hypnotics reported withdrawal symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among older adults in Quebec, a pharmacist-led educational intervention compared with usual care resulted in greater discontinuation of prescriptions for inappropriate medication after 6 months. The generalizability of these findings to other settings requires further research.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (apomorphine hydrocloride) [^f42b7dab]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I use apomorphine hydrocloride injection?

Read the Instructions for Use starting on page 6 of this leaflet for specific information about the right way to use apomorphine hydrocloride injection.
Use apomorphine hydrocloride injection exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
Your healthcare provider will tell you how much apomorphine hydrocloride injection to use and teach you the right way to use it.
Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed.
Do not change your dose of apomorphine hydrocloride injection or use it more often than prescribed unless your healthcare provider has told you to.
Do not give another dose of apomorphine hydrocloride injection sooner than 2 hours after the last dose.
Your healthcare provider will prescribe apomorphine hydrocloride injection that comes in prefilled glass cartridges, for single-patient-use, that are used with a special pen injector.
Your APOKYN®pen is dosed in milliliters (mL), not milligrams (mg). Make sure your prescription tells you how many milliliters (mL) to use.
Inject apomorphine hydrocloride injection under your skin (subcutaneously). Do not inject apomorphine hydrocloride injection into a vein.
Keep a record of how much apomorphine hydrocloride injection you have used each time you inject or your care partner gives you an injection.
Use a new needle with each injection. Never reuse a needle.
apomorphine hydrocloride injection is a clear and colorless liquid. Do not use apomorphine hydrocloride injection if it appears cloudy, colored, or to contain particles, and call your pharmacist.
Your healthcare provider may prescribe another medicine called an antiemetic to take while you are using apomorphine hydrocloride injection. Antiemetic medicines help to decrease the symptoms of nausea and vomiting that can happen with apomorphine hydrocloride injection.
If you take too much apomorphine hydrocloride injection, call your healthcare provider. If you experience severe or serious side effects such as chest pain or prolonged erection lasting more than 4 hours, go to the nearest hospital emergency room.

### Going to the negative: genomics for optimized medical prescription [^9d23c266]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2019). High credibility.

Personalized medicine promises to advance and improve health by targeting the right medication to the right person at the right time, thus maximizing the proportion of treated patients who achieve an effective response to therapy. This Comment article makes the complementary argument that equally important benefits will derive from negative prediction, namely by identifying those individuals who are either not actually in need of, or unlikely to respond to, a drug. Reduction of unnecessary prescription could conceivably save health-care systems many billions of dollars with very little detrimental impact on outcomes.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: considerations and recommendations for prescribing exercise and designing physical activity programs for people with disabilities [^9928b50f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). High credibility.

ACSM Expert Consensus — Table 3 guidance for positive conversational interactions outlines concrete "Do" and "Don't" communication practices with persons with disabilities. Do items include "Ask if the individual's preference of person-first or identity-first language" and "Educate yourself on the person's disability by seeking out information," as well as "Discuss with the individual and their parent/caregiver (if appropriate) to better understand the individual's needs and wants." Don't items include "Presume a person's preference for using person-first or identity-first language," "Assume the individual has experience with specific exercises or physical activities such as walking on a treadmill or riding a bike," and "Rely on a one-size-fits-all approach to communicating."

Figure 2
General diagram for testing and prescribing a resistance exercise programme for the general population. (A) The diagnosis (test) of the current state (1) is the first step for the prescription of resistance exercise through percentages of repetitions with respect to the maximum possible (ie, nRM) to then determine the intra-set velocity loss at different external loads (kg) based on simple and practical tools (2). (B) Once the training goal has been established (1), the intra-set velocity loss is planned through the percentage of repetitions with respect to the maximum possible and the rating scale of perceived exertion (RPE) (2). For further details, refer to the text. Fast MV, fast movement velocity (concentric phase); LoE, level of effort; nRM, repetitions with respect to the maximum possible; %rep, percentage of repetitions with respect to the maximum possible; RPE, rating scale of perceived exertion; RPE 0–10, rating scale of perceived exertion from 0 to 10; RIR, repetitions in reserve; VL, velocity loss.

Conclusions and perspectives

In the present article, we propose that current reference guidelines on PA for the general population from the WHO may be moved forward by adding specific recommendations for exercise prescription in apparently healthy individuals or those with different health conditions. The research in the field of PA during the last decades has set an opportunity for providing overall recommendations based on high-quality evidence. Further efforts should focus on providing complementary and more specific recommendations. In the meantime, we propose a methodology in which the prescription of aerobic exercise should be based on individualised metabolic disturbances and the TID model used by endurance athletes. For RE prescription, we suggest that loads based on MV associated with VL are a more reliable approach than a fixed set number of repetitions. In both cases, the RPE scale can be a useful and valid tool for aerobic and RE testing and prescription. In addition, for aerobic exercise prescription, the TT could be added to provide additional support. These simple tools will allow the general population to be educated about their fitness level and self-management of exercise intensity, and aid professionals, clinicians and primary care providers to optimise exercise programmes for improvement of fitness status, and exercise adherence without the need for specialised equipment and measurements. To improve the specificity of exercise adaptation, future research should focus on further developing training programme components for the general population, such as exercise frequency, intensity, time and type (ie, the FITT principle).

### Fluticasone propionate (armonAir digihaler) [^69f9f623]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

There is an electronic module built into the top of the inhaler that detects, records and stores information about inhaler events. The electronic module sends information through Bluetoothwireless technology to a mobile application (App). The electronic module does not control or interfere with delivery of the medicine through the inhaler.

There is a dose counter in the back of the inhaler with a viewing window that shows you how many doses of medicine you have left. See Figure A.

Figure A

Your ARMONAIR DIGIHALER inhaler contains 60 doses (inhalations). See Figure B.
The dose counter shows the number of doses you have left in your inhaler.
When there are 20 doses left, the color of the numbers on the dose counter will change to red and you should refill your prescription or ask your healthcare provider for another prescription.
When the dose counter displays '0' your inhaler is empty and you should stop using the inhaler and throw it away. See Figure B.

Figure B

Important:

Always close the green cap after each inhalation so your inhaler will be ready for you to take your next dose. Do not open the green cap unless you are ready for your next dose.
You will hear a "click" sound when the green cap is opened fully. If you do not hear the "click" sound the inhaler may not be activated to give you a dose of medicine.
ARMONAIR DIGIHALER does not have an activation button or medicine canister. When you open the green cap, a dose of ARMONAIR DIGIHALER will be activated for delivery of the medicine.

### A prescription for prescribing: ensuring continued pharmacist preparedness [^068b2fb5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

The scope of practice for pharmacists in the United States increasingly includes elements of prescribing under collaborative practice agreements and statewide protocols. However, as a result of continued health care access concerns, we believe that pharmacists will be called on to serve as independent prescribers in the future. For this anticipated practice expansion to become a successful reality, the assurance of pharmacist preparedness and continuous professional development through profession-wide standards will be imperative.

### Practice pearls-aafp… [^4d476918]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

CHECK THIS MAP WHEN PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FOR PATIENTS OUT OF STATE Editor's note: This chart reflects what state boards of pharmacy permitted at the time of publication. Those rules are subject to change over time, and prescribing across state lines may also be affected by state physician licensure and local and federal regulations. Physicians may be unsure about their ability to electronically send controlled substance prescriptions for patients who are away from home. For example, our clinic recently questioned whether we could prescribe stimulants for a patient away at college. Our clinical pharmacist reviewed applicable U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration regulations and information from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy to determine which states allow pharmacies to dispense controlled substances prescribed by doctors in other states. Our findings are summarized in the map below. The map is applicable only to physicians.

We did not review regulations for other types of prescribers, which may vary from state to state. In some cases, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted federal and state governments to relax out-of-state controlled substance prescribing regulations. However, this is subject to change, and a pharmacy may decline to dispense a prescription if local requirements are not met. Calling out-of-state pharmacies before sending electronic prescriptions for the first time may be prudent. MAKE EFFECTIVE E-CONSULT REQUESTS Electronic consults help primary care clinicians get answers to low-complexity clinical questions from specialists without the patient seeing the specialist. This usually allows patients to get needed care faster than waiting for a referral appointment. The expectation in most e-consult programs is for specialists to respond in 24–72 hours. Here are some tips to make the most of e-consults: Include a specific clinical question.

It is not enough to say, "What should I do. " Instead say, "This patient has failed these two medications. Can you suggest a third. " or "She has an abnormal X. What should be the workup after this result. " Examples of e-consult questions appropriate for various specialties are available here. Don't use an e-consult for an urgent situation. If you need an answer within three hours, call the consultant instead. If you have EHR capabilities, include pictures of any physical examination abnormality so the specialist can evaluate it. Write a comprehensive note and make sure it is complete so the consultant does not need to spend a lot of time reviewing the chart.

### Can the selection and use of essential medicines decrease inappropriate drug use? [^1763d747]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that half of all medicines are inappropriately prescribed, dispensed, sold, or taken. Selection from a list limited to the best medicines available for the conditions being treated can decrease inappropriate prescribing. It precludes prescribing less effective or more toxic drugs when better ones are on the list. Prescribers need know about fewer drugs, which enables them to have a better understanding of the drugs they do prescribe. The disadvantages of using such a list — limited ability to prescribe unlisted drugs when desired and delay in listing new drugs — can be overcome by administrative actions. Implementing the essential medicines concept will decrease inappropriate drug use. A much more global, comprehensive, and committed approach needs to be taken by all of us to eliminate it.

### Personalized exercise dose prescription [^7489f675]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Physical activity (PA) is associated with increased longevity and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, however, the majority of the general population is still sedentary. In order to maximize the health benefits of PA, health care practitioners should be familiarized with the appropriate dose of exercise for each healthy individual, depending on their habitual PA and relative fitness. The aim of this review is to quantitatively describe the lowest and the highest level of exercise that has health benefits, and what should hypothetically be considered 'the sweet spot'. Analysis of the current literature allows us to develop personalized 'exercise prescription' for healthy individuals.

### Increasing the uptake of electronic prescribing in primary care [^ec49fd07]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The Electronic Prescription Service was introduced in 2010 and is expected to fully replace paper prescriptions generated in General Practice in the future. Approximately 1.5 million prescriptions are produced daily in England alone. Furthermore, this figure is expected to increase annually by 5%.EPS allows a general practice doctor to generate a computerized prescription for a patient and send that directly to an allocated pharmacy. This pharmacy is chosen by the patient and can be any pharmacy that is part of the EPS. This provides an extremely flexible arrangement for the patient and for those on repeat prescriptions, encourages fewer visits to the practice to pick up a piece of paper. In addition, the issue of lost prescriptions becomes redundant. Furthermore, it was found that in a typical GP setting approximately 7.5% of prescriptions contained an error, however that is bearing in mind that only 1% would incur severe consequences. Nonetheless, paperless prescriptions has been shown to drive down prescribing errors.

Due to the fairly new introduction of EPS in the UK, information regarding its effectiveness in reducing costs, streamlining patient care and reducing prescription errors is lacking. Currently, an EPS costing survey has been completed with the purpose of evaluating the cost and effectiveness of electronic prescribing and is due for release soon. Nevertheless, in case studies from pharmacies in London, electronic prescriptions have already been seen to make up 60%-75% of their prescriptions.

Inadequate training in usage of computers and EPS has been seen to be an issue with practitioners themselves being reluctant to use electronic prescribing. Electronic prescribing has been shown to initially require a learning curve as practitioners become more familiar with the system. However, once this form of prescribing becomes habitual after adequate training and support, the process of prescribing has been illustrated to be quicker and also less prescription mistakes were also observed.

### Patient perceptions regarding electronic prescriptions: is the geriatric patient ready? [^62b07688]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the extent to which electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) alters communication about medication use between geriatric patients and their clinicians, as well as geriatric patients' perceptions regarding e-prescribing.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Thirty-five physician practices in six states using e-prescribing.

Participants

Convenience sample of patients (n = 244) aged 65 and older.

Measurements

Patient perceptions regarding discussions with their doctors regarding medication costs, adherence, and potential side effects, as well as expectations about and satisfaction with e-prescribing collected on a voluntary survey.

Results

Of patients at e-prescribing practices, 53% reported ever receiving e-prescriptions. Patients who reported having e-prescriptions were more likely to feel favorably toward the electronic method, whereas most of those who reported never receiving e-prescriptions preferred paper prescriptions. Patients reporting use of e-prescriptions were somewhat more likely to have adherence discussions often or most of the time than patients who had not used e-prescriptions. Regardless of e-prescribing experience, few patients reported that they would tell their physicians if they did not want a drug or did not plan to pick up the drug from the pharmacy.

Conclusion

E-prescribing technology solutions may provide opportunities for earlier and enhanced communication between geriatric patients and their clinicians; geriatric patients may require more education to appreciate the value of e-prescribing.

### Alternatives to potentially inappropriate medications for use in e-prescribing software: triggers and treatment algorithms [^e70ed020]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Results

While physicians in the focus groups on the whole claimed that triggers and evidenced-based treatment algorithms incorporated into their electronic medical record system would be useful in their practice, they clearly indicated that the triggers must be carefully designed to promote efficiency and reduce redundancy. A physician asserted, "Something pops up, gives you a little tutorial–it has to be short and sweet, something you can read in 30 s."And another explained, "You want to provide a little more information, but you can't have it so long, in providing every explanation… We don't want that because all you're gonna do is click on little boxes, saying 'I don't care, I don't care'.

Participants described the frustration of receiving triggers and alerts about information that they were well aware of, alerts that were repetitive because of the frequency of the condition among patients or because the alert came up every time they saw particular patients, and from receiving alerts claiming that they had prescribed inappropriately when in fact they had made a specific decision to treat the patient in such a manner. Clinicians in the focus groups suggested suppressing alerts for renewals of medication combinations that patients were currently taking and tolerating, as well as for alerts related to medications that were used for short-term courses of therapy. We frequently heard the following sentiment, "Don't keep showing the same ones over and over again."

### Effect of a social norm email feedback program on the unnecessary prescription of nimodipine in ambulatory care of older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^c0184536]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The control group also showed a significant within-group reduction of prescriptions during the intervention phase. As a first hypothesis, we posited a natural decreasing trend in nimodipine use over time. However, the prescription rates were fairly stable during the 2 preceding 6-month periods. As a second hypothesis, we cannot discard the possibility that the control group was not completely blind to the messages directed to the treatment group. Communication between colleagues on prescription drugs is a usual, desirable practice of medical teams. Any contamination may have reduced the differences between the groups but not the intervention's impact and may have unintentionally reduced prescriptions among the whole sample.

The intervention's impact was also evident in several measures. It reduced expenditures and was inexpensive, so it may be considered highly cost-effective. Our study also supports the efficacy of social norm feedback as a behavioral tool for modifying physicians' prescribing and expands the cultural diversity of existing studies. Furthermore, we were able to isolate deterrence effects from other components of the nudge without compromising the intervention's effect. We tested the feasibility of sending emails instead of mail with positive results, since our effects were in the range of earlier studies using mailed letters. The lower costs, speed, and simplicity of emails may make them a more efficient option that has been sparsely used until now. However, the subgroup analysis of participants who reliably opened the emails demonstrates that there is much room for improvement regarding the intervention's effectiveness. Because this group showed a more pronounced reduction in nimodipine prescriptions than the entire sample, it may suggest that if more physicians read the emails, the intervention's effect would be even greater.

### Patient-centred improvement to repeat prescribing using the always event concept [^041ef423]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Lessons and limitations

The person-centred element is critical to the AE approach, and this enabled us to respond to patient feedback on what would enhance their experience of the repeat prescription process. The patients highlighted an inefficiency in the repeat prescribing process, and our team were able to use this information to create a more efficient system for all involved in the process by lessening the related workload and reducing frustration all round. We feel the standard now achieved is very good, and staff and patients have commented on how the reception area runs more smoothly. This reinforces the gain of the change and makes it more likely to be sustained. The follow-up data highlighted that pharmacies are repeatedly asking for prescriptions too early, and this is another area that can be addressed. This could be reduced by alternative systems such as a community pharmacist-managed repeat prescription service. We plan to randomly repeat the process periodically to check that the system continues to function well. The process was feasible in a large, busy practice. A limitation is that it is time-consuming for staff to contact patients, and it may not be possible to contact patients by phone. We have not sent letters to patients if we are unable to contact them by phone, as the timeline is such that they will usually present to the practice before it is practically possible to send a letter. Similar issues are seen in other primary care systems, such as processing and communicating laboratory results. Bowie et al highlighted four themes in this process, namely system variations and weaknesses, doctor to administrator communication, informing patients of test results, and patient follow-up and confidentiality, which are similarly pertinent in the processing of repeat prescription requests.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^b616cb43]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

These medicines should not be used with Sotret unless your doctor tells you it is okay.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your doctor and pharmacist. Do not take any new medicine without talking with your doctor.

How should I take Sotret?

You must take Sotret exactly as prescribed. You must also follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program. Before prescribing Sotret, your doctor will:
explain the iPLEDGE program to you
have you sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients). Female patients who can get pregnant must also sign another consent form.

You will not be prescribed Sotret if you cannot agree to or follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program.

You will get no more than a 30-day supply of Sotret at a time. This is to make sure you are following the Sotret iPLEDGE program. You should talk with your doctor each month about side effects.
The amount of Sotret you take has been specially chosen for you. It is based on your body weight, and may change during treatment.
Take Sotret 2 times a day with a meal, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Swallow your Sotret capsules whole with a full glass of liquid. Do not chew or suck on the capsule. Sotret can hurt the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach (esophagus) if it is not swallowed whole.
If you miss a dose, just skip that dose. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.
If you take too much Sotret or overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away.
Your acne may get worse when you first start taking Sotret. This should last only a short while. Talk with your doctor if this is a problem for you.
You must return to your doctor as directed to make sure you don't have signs of serious side effects. Your doctor may do blood tests to check for serious side effects from Sotret. Female patients who can get pregnant will get a pregnancy test each month.
Female patients who can get pregnant must agree to use 2 separate forms of effective birth control at the same time 1 month before, while taking, and for 1 month after taking Sotret. You must access the iPLEDGE system to answer questions about the program requirements and to enter your 2 chosen forms of birth control. To access the iPLEDGE system, go to www.ipledgeprogram.com or call 1-866-495-0654.

### An electronic prescription alerting system-improving the discharge medicines process [^662af1e4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst the prescribing of both in-patient and discharge medicines is electronic, there was no automatic notification to clinical pharmacists when a discharge prescription was ready to be screened. The notification required a member of medical or nursing staff to bleep their pharmacist informing them of a prescription's availability. This manual process led to a delay in pharmacist screening which impacted on discharge. Prescriptions designated for pre-packed or patient's own medicine use were not seen at all by a clinical pharmacist. The initial intention was to develop a text messaging service; however this was not possible due to significant cost implications and its inflexibility.

Aim

To decrease the time to clinical pharmacist screening for children's discharge prescriptions.

Method

A clinical pharmacist prescription alerting system was designed and implemented. The hospital's eDischarge Summaries are created and stored in the Trust's EPR database. A database query is executed that examines documents that have been signed by a prescriber which contain drug orders. The query runs every 15minutes, Monday to Friday from 0800–2000. The database query exports a HTML data extract which is then packaged and sent using Exchange. Email was preferred as users access hospital WiFi, only receiving notifications on those laptops or smartphones connected to the Trust's email application. The HTML is embedded within the email body. The email is sent to named individuals within a given distribution list. The function is scalable to support all areas using Trust eDischarge Summaries. The system was introduced in April 2015. Data from before (June 2014-January 2015) and after (June 2015) implementation was compared.

Results

Prior to the introduction of an electronic alerting system the average time from a prescriber signing a prescription to clinical pharmacist screening was 93 minutes. Three months after starting the new system this time has reduced to 62minutes, a reduction of 31 minutes or 33%. During the same time period, the number of discharge prescriptions screened by pharmacists rose from 172 to 218, an increase in workload of 26%. It has been possible to intervene on prescriptions containing errors which the clinical pharmacists would not previously have screened.

Conclusion

The use of an electronic messaging system has met its primary aim to decrease the time delay from signing to pharmacist screening it has also increased pharmacist efficiency as evidenced by the increased workload. One limitation of this system is that it requires a regular e-mail check, for available prescriptions. The report runs every 15minutes, an email is only sent if a prescription is found. The notification of all discharge prescriptions containing medicines has led to the identification of errors which have required intervention, in those prescriptions that a pharmacist would not have previously seen. These interventions have been for children who have received pre-packed antibiotics directly from the wards or for those where we have provided one-stop dispensing. It is hoped to role out this system across other areas of the organisation which should also enjoy this significant improvement in discharge prescription turnaround.

### Effects of real-time prescription benefit recommendations on patient out-of-pocket costs: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^9e31a771]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Rising drug costs contribute to medication nonadherence and adverse health outcomes. Real-time prescription benefit (RTPB) systems present prescribers with patient-specific out-of-pocket cost estimates and recommend lower-cost, clinically appropriate alternatives at the point of prescribing.

Objective

To investigate whether RTPB recommendations lead to reduced patient out-of-pocket costs for medications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cluster randomized trial, medical practices in a large, urban academic health system were randomly assigned to RTPB recommendations from January 13 to July 31, 2021. Participants were adult patients receiving outpatient prescriptions during the study period. The analysis was limited to prescriptions for which RTPB could recommend an available alternative. Electronic health record data were used to analyze the intervention's effects on prescribing. Data analyses were performed from August 20, 2021, to June 8, 2022.

Interventions

When a prescription was initiated in the electronic health record, the RTPB system recommended available lower-cost, clinically appropriate alternatives for a different medication, length of prescription, and/or choice of pharmacy. The prescriber could select either the initiated order or one of the recommended options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient out-of-pocket cost for a prescription. Secondary outcomes were whether a mail-order prescription and a 90-day supply were ordered.

Results

Of 867 757 outpatient prescriptions at randomized practices, 36 419 (4.2%) met the inclusion criteria of having an available alternative. Out-of-pocket costs were $39.90 for a 30-day supply in the intervention group and $67.80 for a 30-day supply in the control group. The intervention led to an adjusted 11.2%; (95% CI, -15.7% to -6.4%) reduction in out-of-pocket costs. Mail-order pharmacy use was 9.6% and 7.6% in the intervention and control groups, respectively (adjusted 1.9 percentage point increase; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.0). Rates of 90-day supply were not different. In high-cost drug classes, the intervention reduced out-of-pocket costs by 38.9%; 95% CI, -47.6% to -28.7%.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cluster randomized clinical trial showed that RTPB recommendations led to lower patient out-of-pocket costs, with the largest savings occurring for high-cost medications. However, RTPB recommendations were made for only a small percentage of prescriptions.

### Appropriate prescribing of medications: an eight-step approach [^b91be893]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A systematic approach advocated by the World Health Organization can help minimize poor-quality and erroneous prescribing. This six-step approach to prescribing suggests that the physician should (1) evaluate and dearly define the patient's problem; (2) specify the therapeutic objective; (3) select the appropriate drug therapy; (4) initiate therapy with appropriate details and consider nonpharmacologic therapies; (5) give information, instructions, and warnings; and (6) evaluate therapy regularly (e.g., monitor treatment results, consider discontinuation of the drug). The authors add two additional steps: (7) consider drug cost when prescribing; and (8) use computers and other tools to reduce prescribing errors. These eight steps, along with ongoing self-directed learning, compose a systematic approach to prescribing that is efficient and practical for the family physician. Using prescribing software and having access to electronic drug references on a desktop or handheld computer can also improve the legibility and accuracy of prescriptions and help physicians avoid errors.

### Drug formularies in workers' compensation systems [^7e9a33e8]. ACOEM (2016). Medium credibility.

Workers' compensation formulary authorization workflow — Where a workers' compensation formulary exists, UR agents or PBMs will use the formulary to decide whether to authorize payment, and policy makers must determine at what point approval should happen; approval could occur when a dispensing pharmacist contacts a PBM or other claims agent to request a guarantee of payment, or for non-formulary medications the provider might be required to send a "request for authorization" form at the time the prescription is written, after which patients might wait for notification from a designated pharmacy or PBM. In either case, the authorization process can delay the filling of a prescription by hours or even days.

### Peer comparison or guideline-based feedback and postsurgery opioid prescriptions: a randomized clinical trial [^5bed453a]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we could not disentangle the effects of the social norms mechanisms from the effects of simply having one's prescribing monitored. Of course, monitoring effects would also be present in any clinical version of the intervention (part of the intervention was informing surgeons that their opioid prescribing was being monitored), so this did not bias our estimates of overall intervention effects. Second, we did not assess patient outcomes such as self-reported pain levels, daily functioning, or quality of life. However, other work has not shown a relationship between reduced postoperative prescriptions and adverse patient outcomes, and patients in the intervention arms were not more likely to have an emergency department visit, an inpatient visit, or additional opioid prescription fill following surgery. Third, although we used a clustered design to avoid spillover, surgeons could talk across specialties within hospitals, which could have resulted in contamination and thus understated intervention effects. However, the lack of reduction in the control group suggests that the design prevented substantial spillover effects. Finally, the email was sent to the operating surgeon even when they did not make the discharge prescription. In some cases, surgeons might not have control over prescribing at discharge, and negative feedback for these surgeons could decrease receptivity to other institutional goals. This design choice was intended to avoid spillover (nonsurgeon prescribers are more likely to prescribe across specialties) and any scaled-up version of this intervention would likely send emails directly to the clinicians who make the discharge prescription.

### An automated, dynamic radiation oncology prescription checking system [^56940f2a]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Despite serving as a critical communication tool, radiation oncology prescriptions are entered manually and prone to error. An automated prescription checking system was developed and implemented to help address this problem.

Methods and Materials

Rules defining clinically appropriate prescriptions were generated, examining specific types of errors: (1) unapproved dose per fraction for a given disease site; (2) dose per fraction too large for nonstereotactic treatment technique; and (3) dose per fraction too low. With a goal of catching errors as upstream as possible to minimize their propagation, a report was created and ran every 30 minutes to check all newly written or approved prescriptions against the 3 rules. When a prescription violated these rules, an automated email was immediately sent to the prescriber alerting them of the potential error. System performance was continuously monitored and the criteria triggering an alert adjusted to balance error detection against false positives. Alerts leading to prescription amendment were considered true errors.

Results

From June 2021 to November 2022, the system checked 24,047 prescriptions. A total of 241 email alerts were triggered, for an average alert rate of 1%. Of the 241 alerts, 198 (82.2%) were unapproved doses per fraction for the disease site, 14 (5.8%) were doses per fraction that were too low, and 29 (12%) were doses too large for nonstereotactic treatment technique. Thirty-one percent of alerts led to a change of prescription, suggesting they were true errors. The baseline rate of erroneous prescription entry was 0.3%. A regression model showed that trainee prescription entry and dose per fraction < 150 cGy were significantly associated with true errors.

Conclusions

Given the significant consequences of erroneous prescription entry, which ranged from wasted resources and treatment delays to potentially serious misadministration, there is significant value in implementing automated prescription checking systems in radiation oncology clinics.

### Three arguments against prescription requirements [^8b77f693]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

In this essay, I argue that prescription drug laws violate patients' rights to self-medication. Patients have rights to self-medication for the same reasons they have rights to refuse medical treatment according to the doctrine of informed consent (DIC). Since we should accept the DIC, we ought to reject paternalistic prohibitions of prescription drugs and respect the right of self-medication. In section 1, I frame the puzzle of self-medication; why don't the same considerations that tell in favour of informed consent also justify a right of self-medication? In section 2, I show that the prescription drug system was historically motivated by paternalism. In section 3, I outline the justifications for the DIC in more detail. I show that consequentialist, epistemic, and deontic considerations justify the DIC. In sections 4–6, I argue that these considerations also justify rights of self-medication. I then propose that rights of self-medication require non-prohibitive prescription policies in section 7. I consider two objections in sections 8 and 9: that patients ought not to make medically risky or deadly decisions, and that unrestricted access to prescription-grade pharmaceuticals would result in widespread misuse and abuse. Section 10 concludes.

### Individuals' values and preferences regarding medical cannabis for chronic pain: a descriptive qualitative study [^e2def1c5]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Some participants felt legal status influenced 1) individual decision-making (ie, not being worried about using an illegal substance and potential consequences); 2) the supply of medical cannabis, with improved quality and availability after legalization; and 3) access, by not requiring a prescription. Noted barriers related to the medical system included 1) not having a family doctor; 2) doctors not being educated on medical cannabis use or products, not licensed to authorize medical cannabis, or unwilling to authorize or refer; 3) medical cannabis not being integrated or accepted within the medical system; and 4) medical cannabis licenses being expensive and onerous to obtain. Facilitators within the medical system included 1) doctors, other health professionals or Veterans Affairs Canada caseworkers recommending or being willing to authorize or refer for authorization; 2) doctors supporting discontinuation/tapering of opioids with medical cannabis; and 3) having medical cannabis clinics as resources. Currently, in Canada, there are medical cannabis clinics that do not require referrals and offer services virtually or in-person.

I was kind of blessed or I was lucky enough that I did have a family doctor that was open to providing me with access to medical cannabis. Whereas I do know, unfortunately, a lot of people don't have a family doctor that would prescribe that, or much less – I'm in [Province] – so, or much less have a family doctor. – 1708047 (Current user)

It's more widely accepted by the medical community, at least in my experience, versus having to go and have a refill on any opioid medication versus just renewing your medical marijuana license for the year. – 1308044 (Current user)

I never became a licensed medical user because my wife got her license and I saw how expensive and onerous the process was… you know, the fact that it's not covered by any, any benefits program or even the [Provincial program] is a bit of a disadvantage because, you know, I treat it as a medicine, as much as anything. And you know, if everybody had to get their pain meds the way medical cannabis users used to have to get theirs, there would have been riots in the streets - 2509052 (Current user)

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^d79f0302]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care.

Participants

309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention

Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results

Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Behavioral economics interventions to improve outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^9c778153]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Behavioral economics interventions have been shown to effectively reduce the rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (ARIs).

Objective

To determine the cost-effectiveness of three behavioral economic interventions designed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs.

Design

Thirty-year Markov model from the US societal perspective with inputs derived from the literature and CDC surveillance data.

Subjects

Forty-five-year-old adults with signs and symptoms of ARI presenting to a healthcare provider.

Interventions

(1) Provider education on guidelines for the appropriate treatment of ARIs; (2) Suggested Alternatives, which utilizes computerized clinical decision support to suggest non-antibiotic treatment choices in lieu of antibiotics; (3) Accountable Justification, which mandates free-text justification into the patient's electronic health record when antibiotics are prescribed; and (4) Peer Comparison, which sends a periodic email to prescribers about his/her rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing relative to clinician colleagues.

Main Measures

Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

Key Results

Each intervention has lower costs but higher QALYs compared to provider education. Total costs for each intervention were $178.21, $173.22, $172.82, and $172.52, and total QALYs were 14.68, 14.73, 14.74, and 14.74 for the control, Suggested Alternatives, Accountable Justification, and Peer Comparison groups, respectively. Results were most sensitive to the quality-of-life of the uninfected state, and the likelihood and costs for antibiotic-associated adverse events.

Conclusions

Behavioral economics interventions can be cost-effective strategies for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions by reducing healthcare resource utilization.

### Clinical update: telepsychiatry with children and adolescents [^36f79449]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Telepsychiatry prescribing and regulations — Procedures for prescribing noncontrolled medications include e-prescribing, calling prescriptions to the pharmacy, or sending hard copies to the family or pharmacy, and some programs prefer that prescriptions be sent to the patient site for their distribution to the family. Controlled medications, including Schedule II stimulants, have additional regulations under the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, and psychiatrists should become familiar with this federal legislation and state guidelines while awaiting clarification from the DEA.

### Telemedicine companies providing prescription-only medications: pros, cons, and proposed guidelines [^8f1e8f7c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of direct-to-consumer telehealth companies offering prescription medications to women. Leveraging technology, these companies have the potential to improve access to care and ensure that women have access to prescription-only medications in a convenient fashion. However, it is important to ensure that they are doing so in a safe, patient-centered way that observes evidence-based prescribing guidelines. In this article, we discuss the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer telehealth companies offering prescription medicine and suggest several guidelines to ensure that women are being cared for in an appropriate way.

### Challenges to evidence-based prescribing in clinical practice [^8311ebf3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although there appears to be widespread support of evidence-based medicine as a basis for rational prescribing, the challenges to it are significant and often justified. A multitude of factors other than evidence drive clinical decision-making, including patient preferences and social circumstances, presence of disease-drug and drug-drug interactions, clinical experience, competing demands from more pressing clinical conditions, marketing and promotional activity, and system-level drug policies.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^18e95ad5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

While the majority of the 80 guidelines included in this scoping review presented one or more recommendations about for whom, what medicines and when or why to deprescribe, treatment guidelines did not routinely contain clear and actionable recommendations on how to deprescribe. Producing comprehensive deprescribing recommendations may be achieved by co-designing a template, reporting standard, or best practice guide, containing information on aspects of deprescribing recommendations that are essential, or preferred, to enable consistency of content (eg, details of how to taper) and format (terminology and presentation). Such guidance may help ensure that the intended meaning of deprescribing recommendations are adequately conveyed and that recommendations are actionable for end-users, to ultimately reduce inappropriate medicine use and improve patient care.

American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) expert consensus statement on prescribing exercise and designing physical activity programs for people with disabilities reports that "participating in physical activity and meeting physical activity guidelines are far more challenging for persons with disabilities than for the general population," and provides an evidence-based overview of "the impact of physiological factors, physical activity guidelines, and personal, environmental, and policy barriers on physical activity participation and prescription for individuals with disabilities." It outlines "three consensus statements derived from research evidence" and "five practical recommendations for prescribing and designing physical activity programs tailored to adults with disabilities," and "highlights the need for exercise prescriptions and physical activity programs for persons with disabilities to be individualized."

### Evaluation of the impact of letters to GP practices to promote asthma prescription uptake in school-age children during summer (TRAINS study): a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial [^fcf497a9]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations peak in school-aged children after the return to school in September. Previous studies have shown a decline in collections of asthma prescriptions during August. The PLEASANT trial demonstrated that sending a reminder letter to parents increased prescription uptake; reduced unscheduled care, and was cost saving to the health service. We aimed to assess whether informing general practitioner (GP) practices about the PLEASANT trial and its results could lead to its implementation in routine practice.

Methods

The trial to assess implementation of new research in a primary care setting (TRAINS) was a pragmatic cluster-randomised (1:1) trial conducted in England involving GP practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The intervention was a letter informing the GP practice of the PLEASANT trial results with recommendations for implementation. GP practices in the control group continued with usual care without receiving any letters about PLEASANT trial. The intervention was distributed via CPRD by both mail and email in June 2021. The trial received both University of Sheffield Ethics approval and Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) approval. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with asthma (aged 4–15 years) who had a prescription for a preventer between Aug 1 and Sept 30, 2021. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05226091.

Findings

A total of 1326 GP practices, including 90583 children with asthma, were included in the study. These practices were randomly allocated to the intervention group (664 practices, 44708 children) or the control group (662 practices, 45875 children). In assessing the impact of the intervention on the proportion of children collecting a preventer prescription, 15716 (35·3%) of 44708 children from the intervention group and 16001 (35·1%) of 45559 children from the control group picked up a prescription. There was no statistically significant difference observed (odds ratio [OR] 1·01, 95% CI 0·97–1·05), indicating that the intervention had no effect.

Interpretation

The study findings suggest that passive intervention of providing a letter to GPs did not achieve the intended outcomes. To bridge the gap between evidence and practice, alternative, more proactive strategies could be explored to address the identified issues.

### Eflornithine hydrochloride (Vaniqa) [^3bdd92c8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Patient Information Leaflet for

VANIQA

(eflornithine hydrochloride) Cream, 13.9%

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

This section contains important information about VANIQA that you should read before you begin treatment. This section does not list all the benefits and risks of VANIQA and does not take the place of discussions with your doctor or healthcare professional about your condition or your treatment. If you have questions, talk with your healthcare professional. The medicine described here can only be prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional. Only your healthcare professional can determine if VANIQA is right for you.

What is VANIQA? VANIQA (pronounced "VAN-i-ka") is a prescription medication applied to the skin for the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women.

The active ingredient in VANIQA is eflornithine hydrochloride. VANIQA also contains ceteareth-20, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, methylparaben, mineral oil, PEG-100 stearate, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, stearyl alcohol and water.

How does VANIQA work? VANIQA interferes with an enzyme found in the hair follicle of the skin needed for hair growth. This results in slower hair growth and improved appearance where VANIQA is applied.

### Community pharmacists' contribution to medication reviews for older adults: a systematic review [^e42f320b]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify medication review interventions for older adults that involve community pharmacists and evidence of outcomes of these interventions.

Design

Systematic review.

Measurements

Cinahl, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 2000 and February 2016. Articles involving community pharmacists in medication reviews for outpatients aged 65 and older were included. Evidence of economic, clinical, and humanistic outcomes of interventions was summarized.

Results

Sixteen articles were found that described 12 medication review interventions, of which 6 were compliance and concordance reviews, 4 were clinical medication reviews, and 2 were prescription reviews according to a previously developed typology. Community pharmacists' contributions to reviewing medications varied from sending the dispensing history to other healthcare providers to comprehensive involvement in medication management. The most commonly assessed outcomes of the interventions were medication changes leading to reduction in actual or potential drug-related problems (n = 12) and improved adherence (n = 5).

Conclusion

Regardless of community pharmacists' contributions to interventions, medication review interventions seem to reduce drug-related problems and increase medication adherence. More well-designed, rigorous studies with more sensitive and specific outcomes measures need to be conducted to assess the effect of community pharmacists' contributions to reviewing medications and improving the health of older adults.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^efcdcd78]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Use of midstream urine analysis

There was no evidence that either using midstream urine analysis as an initial strategy to guide antibiotic prescribing or the use of midstream urine samples by doctors as part of their overall clinical management made any difference to ordering analysis during follow-up or other outcomes. As with antibiotic prescribing, as perceptions change among patients and doctors regarding the need for midstream urine analysis in clinical management of uncomplicated infections, use of laboratory resources for such an unnecessary investigation could be significantly reduced.

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples, and patients who delay waiting for results of such analysis by more than 48 hours might have poor symptom control. Antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription help reduce antibiotic use.

### Management of respiratory tract infections in young children – A qualitative study of primary care providers' perspectives [^3331795f]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Theme 5: Factors influencing GPs' advice regarding antibiotic prescribing

In terms of antibiotic prescribing, GPs were mostly reluctant to prescribe unnecessarily — i.e. in situations where they believed the illness was viral and uncomplicated. However, extra-clinical factors such as perception of what they thought parents wanted, parental pressure, and concerns that parents would seek antibiotics elsewhere influenced antibiotic prescribing.

GPs also commented that they were sometimes guided by parents in prescribing antibiotics. Some GPs had the perception that parents expected antibiotics as a treatment for RTI even before coming in for the consultation. Some GPs succumbed to parental pressure if parents were absolutely insistent, concerned that if they didnot prescribe, parents would go elsewhere to obtain a prescription from another doctor. As they want to ''please'' the parents, it was ''easier to write a script'.

"… if they say ''I do want antibiotics'', unless it's really late in the day, and I'm really tired and I've had enough, I will try and explain why… " GP2

"Sometimes they are quite demanding for antibiotics. Then probably you've got less threshold… cos you've got to make them happy… you try and explain to them the pros and cons of antibiotics, but in the end, you just have to please them… " GP8

"… if they are absolutely insistent and I know they are pretty much going to walk out of the door and request for another doctor, I'd give them a script… " GP13

Delayed prescribing was often mentioned as a strategy for GPs to deal with demanding parents who wanted antibiotics for viral RTIs. Of the 20 GPs interviewed, 18 said they have previously provided antibiotic scripts to anxious parents but cautioned the parents not to start until it was necessary.

### ACMT position statement: off-label prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic [^61142644]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). High credibility.

Off-label prescribing during COVID-19 — diversion, hoarding, and allocation — notes that off-label prescription and use can also be associated with additional problematic implications including diversion of medications, hoarding, and hindering clinical research. Off-label prescription for treating COVID-19 may also inappropriately divert medication from patients who currently need them, and currently, patients with autoimmune conditions are experiencing difficulty obtaining hydroxychloroquine. Medical evidence as well as medication availability should be considered when recommending off-label administration for unproven indications, and in general, patients with conditions with established benefit from a drug should be prioritized to receive scarce medications over those with conditions (or potential conditions) with unclear benefit. "Hoarding" medications is the practice of inappropriately securing a supply of a medication among those who are not yet ill, such as for prescribers or their family members, and as a result, hoarding can make medications unavailable for those who need it for the potential benefit of people who currently do not and who may never need it. Prescribers should eschew the practice of off-label prescribing for unproven use, because it unjustly encourages allocation of a limited resource without consideration for need.

### Cefotaxime injection (cefotaxime) [^8c7aba85]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The barcode on the imported product label may not register accurately on the U.S. scanning systems. Institutions should manually input the imported product information into their systems and confirm that the barcode, if scanned, provides correct information. Alternative procedures should be followed to assure that the correct drug product is being used and administered to individual patients.

In addition, the packaging of the imported product does not include serialization information. SteriMax's Cefotaxime for Injection does not meet the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) requirements for the Interoperable Exchange of Information for Tracing of Human, Finished Prescription Drugs.

The vial and carton labels will display the text used and approved for marketing the products in Canada with both English and French translations. It is important to note that there are differences in the format and content of the labeling between the US approved product and SteriMax's Cefotaxime for Injection. Please see the product comparison tables at the end of this letter.

### ACMT position statement: off-label prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic [^54ff4ca8]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position on off-label prescribing during COVID-19 — There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications proven to treat coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and unproven medications should be administered as part of rigorous clinical research when feasible and appropriate; when this is not possible, expanded access (formerly "compassionate use") and medications with an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) may be employed for patients without other good therapeutic options who cannot be enrolled in conventional clinical trials, and off-label use of medications for treatment may be indicated when the likely benefits of prescribing to the individual patient outweigh the potential harms, the intervention is not being evaluated in an appropriate clinical trial and expanded access is not an option; off-label prescribing is the least favorable way to use unproven medications for COVID-19 and provides the least regulatory oversight and the least opportunity to learn from their administration.

### Direct-to-consumer drug advertisement and prescribing practices: evidence review and practical guidance for clinicians [^c712bc12]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Direct to consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs has increased dramatically in the past two decades. The effect of this increase in advertising on the frequency of inappropriate prescribing is poorly understood, as are the factors that may underly inappropriate prescribing. A review of existing observational and experimental studies that address advertising-related prescription requests and contain some measure of prescription appropriateness demonstrate that DTCA increases prescription requests, increases the likelihood of prescription, and increases both appropriate and inappropriate prescribing. Patient expectations, insufficient information sharing, and patient satisfaction surveys are proposed contributors to potentially inappropriate prescribing in response to DTCA.

### Bayesian strategy selection identifies optimal solutions to complex problems using an example from GP prescribing [^8f9dd0dc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Proposed interventions

Participants prioritised eight potential interventions to increase GPs recommending PA as a preventative health measure in Geelong:
Physical activity coaching mentors. Under this strategy GPs received coaching and mentoring on discussing PA with patients from an accredited exercise physiologist.
Physical activity recommendation tools. As part of a routine consultation, GPs briefly asked each patient about their level of PA. Based on this discussion the GPs recommended an appropriate level of PA using a "physical activity prescription," guided participants through the completion of a SMART goal sheet relating to their PA objectives, and gave the patient a pamphlet outlining the Australian PA recommendations and associated health benefits.
Physical activity information given to patient by receptionist at check-in. Reception staff handed patients a small pack of information about physical activity, including printed copies of publicly available fliers from Australian health organisations (for example see heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/I_can_be_active_today.pdf). The pack of information could then be used to prompt discussion in consultation with the patient.
Physical activity information given to patient by GP during consultation. GPs will hand patients a small pack of information about physical activity, including printed copies of publicly available fliers from Australian health organisations (for example see heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/I_can_be_active_today.pdf). The pack of information could then be used to prompt discussion in consultation with the patient.
Posters promoting physical activity on display around the GPs clinic, and in consultation rooms. Reception staff placed publicly available posters from an Australian health organisation (livelighter.com.au/Assets/resource-vic/poster/AP1300_LL_Poster-A3_Stairs_FA_online_v2.pdf, livelighter.com.au/Assets/resource-vic/poster/AP1300_LL_Poster-A3_Walk-to-shops_FA_online_v2.pdf) around the clinic. During consultations, GPs could either begin a conversation around PA if the patient noticed the posters and asked a related question, otherwise they could start a conversation by asking patients if they noticed the posters as a talking point to begin a conversation.
Integration of physical activity information into Health Pathways. Health Pathways (westvicphn.com.au/health-professionals/healthpathways) is an on-line source of information on assessment, management and local referral options for GPs and other primary health care providers. Through partnership with local administrators of the system, information was added to help GPs connect quickly with information and resources relating to PA during the consultation, to support conversation with the patient.
Administration of a physical activity assessment completed by the patient in the waiting room. At check in, reception staff handed patients a questionnaire (assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/192450/GPPAQ_-_pdf_version.pdf) to complete while they sit in the waiting room. Discussion about PA could then be prompted either by the patient if they ask directly about the survey, or by the GP asking the patient about their results.
GP supported/recommended physical activity groups. For this strategy, GPs showed patients information available online about local opportunities to participate in social physical activity groups, centred around walking clubs in the local area.

### NHS prescription charges [^5948338a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

In 2009, DTB published an editorial calling for the abolition of the NHS prescription charge.1 The article highlighted that from April 2011, England would be the only UK country that would tax patients for medicines through levying a prescription charge. In addition, it noted that the categorisation of medical and other exemptions is illogical and that the prescription charge is a poorly conceived, manifestly unfair tax. Of particular concern is the impact of the prescription charge on patients with chronic conditions that do not fall into the exemption categories. For many years the Prescription Charges Coalition, an alliance of more than 30 organisations concerned with the impact of prescription charges on people with long-term conditions, has campaigned to extend exemption from prescription charges to all those with long-term conditions.2 A subsequent DTB editorial, published in 2014, discussed anomalies associated with the prescription charge, including the cost of administering the bureaucracy needed to underpin the collection and checking of exemptions, and management of pre-payment certification.3 The editorial repeated the call for prescription charges to be abolished. Revisiting these themes, here we present an overview of the results of a survey conducted to explore the views of healthcare professionals on the NHS prescription charge.

### Personalized prescription feedback using routinely collected data to reduce antibiotic use in primary care: a randomized clinical trial [^05fe9e21]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Feedback interventions using routinely collected health data might reduce antibiotic use nationwide without requiring the substantial resources and structural efforts of other antibiotic stewardship programs.

Objective

To determine if quarterly antibiotic prescription feedback over 2 years reduces antibiotic use when implemented in a complex health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Pragmatic randomized trial using routinely collected claims data on 2900 primary care physicians with the highest antibiotic prescription rates in Switzerland.

Interventions

Physicians were randomized to quarterly updated personalized antibiotic prescription feedback over 2 years (n = 1450) or usual care (n = 1450). Feedback was provided both by mail and online from October 2013 to October 2015 and was supported by an initial 1-time provision of evidence-based guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the prescribed defined daily doses (DDD) of any antibiotic to any patient per 100 consultations in the first year analyzed by intention-to-treat. We further analyzed prescriptions of specific antibiotics, age groups, and sex for the first and second year to investigate persistency of effects over time.

Results

The 2900 physicians had 10 660 124 consultations over 2 years of follow-up, prescribed 1 175 780 packages of antibiotics with 10 290 182 DDD. Physicians receiving feedback prescribed the same amount of antibiotics to all patients in the first year (between-group difference, 0.81%; 95% CI, -2.56% to 4.30%; P = 0.64) and second year (between-group difference, -1.73%; 95% CI, -5.07% to 1.72%; P = 0.32) compared with the control group. Prescribing to children aged 6 to 18 years was -8.61% lower in the feedback than in the control group in the first year (95% CI, -14.87% to -1.90%; P = 0.01). This difference diminished in the second year (between-group difference, -4.10%; 95% CI, -10.78% to 3.07%; P = 0.25). Physicians receiving feedback prescribed fewer antibiotics to adults aged 19 to 65 years in the second year (between-group difference, -4.59%; 95% CI, -7.91% to -1.16%; P < .01). Prescribing to other patient groups or of specific antibiotic types was not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

This nationwide antibiotic stewardship program with routine feedback on antibiotic prescribing was not associated with a change of antibiotic use. In older children, adolescents, and younger adults less antibiotics were prescribed, but not consistently over the entire intervention period.

### Translating research into clinical practice: quality improvement to halve non-adherence to methotrexate [^f8ad0e01]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Process map: process mapping was undertaken to understand the pathway from the clinical decision to prescribe MTX to the patient being established on therapy. From this, points in the pathway that were potential barriers to adherence were identified.
Motivational interviewing (MI): training was organized for all permanent members of staff with refresher You-tube training commissioned. MI is a patient-centred consultation technique designed to elicit the patient's own goals and plans for behaviour change.
Personalized approach to tackling MTX concerns: at the point of decision about starting MTX, clinicians could flag on the drug education referral form if they had initial concerns regarding non-adherence specific to the patient. This allowed addressing the appropriate raised issues in more detail during the 1:1 drug education consultation. Clinicians were given the following choices on the form: Patient seems anxious (not taking in information/conversation jumping around) Not convinced patient believes this is the right treatment Patient concerned about side effects I have no concerns and am sure that this patient will have no issues with non-adherence
A theory informed 'agenda-setting' tool was developed, following three PDSA cycles, in order to focus consultations and ensure that adherence was addressed directly.
'What happens next' sheet: a flowchart for patients was developed following three rounds of PDSA to provided clearer information about progression through the prescribing pathway once MTX was commenced. It included contact numbers in case of difficulty obtaining MTX prescriptions, as these are prescribed from the hospital until patients are established on a stable dose of MTX according to shared care protocols.
Drug education: MTX patient education slides were extensively revised to include positive messages about the benefits of treatments, information on absolute risks of adverse events as well as strategies to improve adherence through identified barriers to taking MTX regularly. Six PDSA cycles were undertaken before a final slide set was agreed.
Points to remember for MTX: six education points were agreed within the core and wider clinical team, as being imperative for patients to remember about MTX. A summary bookmark containing the main points to remember about MTX was developed following three PDSA cycles to be handed to patients at the time they received their MTX drug education from the nursing team. These points were also included on laminated sheets in clinic rooms and in the junior doctors' office to re-inforce the consistent messaging. Additionally, a banner was made with these points in the waiting area, to promote a culture for openly talking about adherence and any concerns about MTX.
Maintaining long-term momentum: a series of regular meetings with all consultant, nursing and pharmacy colleagues were held, during which consensus was reached on information to be provided to patients to ensure consistency of messages by all clinical team members. The core team met on a weekly basis to discuss monthly data, patient feedback, plan/revise strategies as required and keep up the momentum of introducing a culture of improving adherence to medicines in the department.

### Bridging the gap between clinicians and fitness professionals: a challenge to implementing exercise as medicine [^45f037e3]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite the limitations and given the burgeoning market of the health and fitness industry, the observed disconnect in this study between the clinical and fitness practitioner domains is somewhat alarming. The former president of the American College of Sports Medicine recently called for the establishment of a 'pharmacy' for exercise prescription, staffed by patient support people with backgrounds in health, fitness and/or nutrition. Our results, however, suggest that there is a gap of communication and referral between physicians and HC, with a particular breach regarding PT. Given that physical activity programming has been recommended to be personalised, based on individual habits, preferences, motivation and tolerance, and presented in such a way that will '… fit more seamlessly into the context of… daily routines', this divide could be seen as problematic for implementation. By dismissing HC, and PT in particular, as viable options for personalised exercise care, physicians may be limiting their patients' exposure to a critical component of healthy lifestyle behaviour. Moreover, this partnership may attenuate physician uncertainty about the effectiveness of written PA prescription, as recently reported.

### A three-part intervention to change the use of hormone replacement therapy in response to new evidence [^3dc4519e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Slow adaptation of new information by providers may result in suboptimal care.

Objective

To evaluate changes in prescriptions for combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after a multicomponent intervention to deliver new information to patients and providers.

Design

Quasi-experimental study with multiple baselines.

Setting

Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (VA-TVHS).

Patients

Female veterans age 50 to 79 years who had a prescription filled at the VA-TVHS for combination HRT between 1 January 2002 and 1 July 2002.

Measurements

Discontinuation of HRT.

Intervention

A 3-part intervention consisted of 1) notifying patients who were using combination HRT of the results of the Women's Health Initiative study (patient education component), 2) sending all providers an e-mail with the Women's Health Initiative study results (provider education component), and 3) placing an electronic alert in each eligible patient's chart (provider care component). The alert asked providers to reevaluate the need for combination HRT. The intervention was implemented at different VA-TVHS sites in a stepwise fashion to differentiate intervention effect from media effect. Study follow-up continued through 31 December 2002.

Results

The total rate of discontinuation of combination HRT was 70.3% in 2002. The proportion of discontinuation from time of media release until intervention was 23.3%. After initiation of the intervention, an additional 43% of the original cohort discontinued use of HRT; this percentage represents a 59% relative decrease in HRT use among patients. After adjustment for time, the discontinuation rate per day was 4.9 times higher after the multifacted intervention than after the media release (95% CI, 1.8 to 13.1).

Limitations

A true control group is lacking.

Conclusion

A multifaceted approach in an integrated health care system with standardized methods of communication is an effective way to implement patient-centered, effective, and timely care with changing medical knowledge.

### Personalised performance feedback reduces narcotic prescription errors in a NICU [^aa31ca5e]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Implementation

The implementation team educated frontline fellows, nurse practitioners and physician assistants on the intent and content of the feedback programme using emails and in-person meetings, and encouraged responses regarding system vulnerabilities. Many frontline members were already familiar with the feedback programme, having been involved with its development. The system was implemented in March 2010. Every 2 weeks, the team reviewed prescribing errors, looked for common error themes, and sent out the feedback communications. Table 1 contains examples of prescription errors and the feedback provided.

Table 1
Sample prescription errors

Evaluation and analysis

The primary outcome was number of days between narcotic errors and antibiotic prescribing errors. This outcome was represented over time in a time-to-event chart (t-chart), where the y-axis displayed the number of days between consecutive errors arranged in chronological order. The t-chart was chosen over a u-chart (i.e., error rates) for 2 reasons: (1) we were unable to consistently estimate the number of prescriptions (denominator) every 2 weeks and (2) the t-chart is designed to track rare events such as prescribing errors (approximately 0.5% to 1% of prescriptions in the NICU). T-chart control limits were calculated and Shewhart rules for special-cause signals were applied to identify significant shifts in the mean and trends of days between errors. Interventions were directly annotated onto the charts.

To assess whether emails were read (ie, process metric), our team utilised the 'Read Reply' function in the email system. The percentage of responses was measured over time by calculating the number of responses over the total number of prescribers who received the email. The email was re-sent to those who did not respond. As a balancing metric, we also tracked the time required to (1) identify and discuss errors and (2) construct and send the emails.

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^6dc9f222]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Overview

This pilot study was set within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare system in the northwestern United States with about 710,000 members and about 6000 births per year. Our study team conducted two focus groups with a total of twenty women who had filled at least one prescription for an anti-nausea medication during pregnancy. Our reporting of participant sampling, data collection, and data analysis follows the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines.

Sampling/recruitment

We used purposive sampling that focused on recruiting women living in the Seattle/Tacoma metropolitan area who were 18 years and older, who delivered a liveborn infant in 2015 or 2016, and who had filled at least one prescription for an anti-nausea medication during pregnancy (Table 1). Filling at least one prescription indicated to us that women experienced enough of a burden from nausea that they communicated with their provider about their symptoms and were likely to have actively considered the pros and cons of taking anti-nausea medication. Purposive sampling involves identifying individuals that have knowledge or experience with a phenomenon of interest and are willing to participate in research. We excluded women with other serious health conditions during pregnancy (pregestational diabetes, cardiac disease, renal disease, liver disease, autoimmune disease, HIV, or a major psychiatric disorder) or adverse pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirth or major birth defects. KPWA electronic health records were used to identify women meeting these inclusion and exclusion criteria.

We then mailed a recruitment letter to a random sample of 700 women from the eligible population. Women could call in to volunteer for focus groups. Within a week of sending the recruitment letters we began reaching out to potential participants by phone to invite them to participate and continued these calls until focus groups had been filled. In all, 20 women attended the focus groups.

### Association of advisory committee votes with US food and drug administration decision-making on prescription drugs, 2010–2021 [^e0fde7b2]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often relies on independent advisory committees when making decisions about the approval of prescription drugs or their withdrawal from the market. These committees provide the FDA with valuable insight and an opportunity to build public trust through transparent deliberation, but recent controversies have raised questions about the optimal use of FDA advisory committees.

Objective

To assess the frequency, purposes, and voting outcomes of human drug advisory committees convened from 2010 to 2021 and the FDA's corresponding actions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This qualitative study used a manual review of meeting summaries prepared by FDA staff for the 18 human drug advisory committees active at any time from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, as well as FDA announcements and press releases, drug labels and approval data, industry publications, and company press releases.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes of votes on regulatory questions were recorded using meeting minutes. Alignment of FDA action with advisory votes for new drugs and indications was judged as of 1 year after the vote was held and as of November 30, 2022.

Results

The FDA held 409 human drug advisory committee meetings from 2010 to 2021. Committees were convened less frequently over time, from a high of 50 in 2012 to a low of 18 in 2020 and 2021. Much of this decrease occurred at committee meetings involving votes on initial approvals, which declined from a high of 26 in 2012 to a low of 8 in 2021. Overall, FDA regulatory actions aligned with 262 of 298 advisory committee votes on initial approvals, supplemental approvals, withdrawals of approval, and safety actions (88%). Approval followed 142 of 147 positive votes for initial approvals (97%) and 33 of 36 positive votes for supplemental indications (92%), while nonapproval followed 40 of 60 negative votes on initial approvals (67%) and 18 of 21 negative votes on supplemental indications (86%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this qualitative study, there was consistent alignment between advisory votes and FDA action across years and subject areas, but the number of meetings decreased over time. Discordance between FDA actions and advisory committee votes was most frequently an approval after a negative vote. This study demonstrated that these committees have played a key role in the FDA's decision-making process but that the FDA sought independent expert advice less frequently over time even as it continued to follow it. The role of advisory committees in the current regulatory landscape should be more clearly and publicly defined.

### ACMT position statement: off-label prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic [^2f33e308]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). High credibility.

Off-label use during COVID-19 — practice scope and clinician obligations — states that off-label use, the practice of prescribing FDA-approved medications outside of their approved indications, is another option for using unproven medications, and off-label prescribing is common in everyday clinical practice because it is not practical to obtain formal FDA approval for every condition and population where a medication may be helpful. The practice may be appropriate when the clinician judges there is enough evidence to suggest the use of the medication is in the patient's best interest; however, off-label prescribing is the least rigorous way to attempt to treat COVID-19 because this pathway has the least ethical and regulatory oversight and offers the least opportunity to learn from the administration of unproven medications. A medication should never be prescribed with the intent of experimentation or research outside of a protocol formally approved by an IRB, and off-label use should be supported by evidence. In keeping with shared medical decision making, clinicians should disclose the risks of unproven medications to patients and ensure that such a use comports with patients' preferences, and disclosure of the off-label status of medication should be part of this discussion.

### Patient and family perceptions of the provision of medicines as part of virtual outpatient consultations for children during COVID-19 pandemic [^b8de7fa4]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate (1) views and perceptions of patients/parents/carers and healthcare professionals on the medicines optimisation (MO) process following virtual outpatient clinic (VOC) during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) the processes introduced at this time, identifying areas for improvements and suggest potential solutions.

Design

A mixed-methods service evaluation using qualitative and quantitative methods of the MO pathway in children aged 0–18 years following VOC across three specialist children's units. Semi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone with the participants exploring their experiences and categorised into themes. Process mapping sessions with the multidisciplinary team identified areas for improvement and an ease impact framework developed for potential solutions. Outcome measures included: (1) themes from interviews, (2) patients satisfaction rates, (3) process maps and (4) development of a simplified future process.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients' families were contacted: 71 families consented to participate and their views were categorised into four main themes: (1) patient experience, (2) communication, (3) need for virtual video consultations for patient education by hospital pharmacists and (4) need for electronic processes to send prescriptions to local pharmacies. Median patient satisfaction rate was 96% (range 67%-100%). The convenience of receiving medications directly to patient's homes; access to medicines information helplines and education provided by pharmacists were regarded as valuable. Communication between care providers, development of virtual video consultations by hospital pharmacists and electronic transfer of some prescriptions directly to community pharmacies were identified as areas of improvement.

Conclusions

Participants appreciated the pharmacy processes adopted during the pandemic, however, challenges and recommendations for improvement in delivering MO VOC were identified. As digital innovations evolve within the NHS, future research should focus on integrated care and improved communication between care providers with selected medications prescribed directly to community pharmacies using electronic prescription service, with clinical screening and education provided by hospital pharmacists.

### Safety profile of orlistat: results of a prescription-event monitoring study [^312db75a]. International Journal of Obesity (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Orlistat, the first of a new class of drugs for the treatment of obesity, was launched in the UK in December 1998. The prescribing information recommends that treatment with orlistat should be discontinued after 12 weeks if the patient has not achieved a specified loss of weight.

Objective

To monitor the safety of orlistat prescribed in the primary care setting in England using prescription-event monitoring (PEM).

Methods

A postmarketing surveillance study using the observational cohort technique of PEM. Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions issued by primary care physicians for orlistat between December 1998 and November 1999. The outcome data were event reports obtained by sending questionnaires (green forms) to the prescribing doctor at least 6 months after the first prescription for an individual patient. Incidence densities, expressed as number of first reports of an event/1000 patient-months of exposure, were calculated. Significant differences between incidence densities (IDs) for events reported in the 1st month (ID(1)) and months 2 and 3 (ID(2–3)) of exposure were regarded as potential signals. Reasons for stopping orlistat were analysed. Follow-up information was requested for selected events and used to assess the causal association with orlistat.

Results

Green forms containing clinically useful information on 16 021 patients (median age 45 years (interquartile range 35–54); 80.1% females) were received. The events reported most frequently during the 1st month of treatment were 'not effective' (639; 4.0% of cohort), diarrhoea (371; 2.3%) and weight loss (230; 1.4%). Twelve clinical adverse events were identified for which ID(1) was significantly greater than ID(2–3). These included non-specific events (e.g. intolerance, malaise/lassitude, unspecified side effects), weight loss and vaginitis/vulvitis. The remaining events were gastrointestinal in nature and included diarrhoea, pain abdomen, flatulence, nausea/vomiting, rectal discharge, faecal incontinence and 'gastrointestinal unspecified' events. A similar pattern of predominately gastrointestinal events was seen for reasons for stopping and suspected adverse drug reactions. Review of selected events for causality revealed 45 events which were assessed as possibly or probably related to orlistat.

Conclusions

This study shows that orlistat is fairly well tolerated. The safety profile of orlistat was similar to the prescribing information and experience reported in the literature.

### Health care issues for children and adolescents in foster care and kinship care [^17b18683]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

The foster care–friendly office — practice features that support children in foster and kinship care include that a foster care–friendly office is a trauma-informed office. Pediatricians can welcome foster and kinship caregivers, caseworkers, and birth parents, when appropriate, to health visits and educate them about the effects of childhood trauma and adversity on a child's emotional and developmental health. The medical home staff can provide information about managing health problems and emotional, behavioral, and developmental concerns; identify resources; and coordinate referrals. Pediatricians can be advocates for children in their care to ensure that each child's health needs are met, screen for signs of abuse and neglect at every health encounter, remain alert to the quality of the caregiver–child relationship, and share any concerns with the child's caseworker. The medical home can create a foster care–friendly environment by obtaining a copy of signed consents from the foster care agency and maintaining them as a part of the child's health record, having contact information for the child's caseworker in the child's chart, and sending a summary of the health visit that includes immunizations and other recommendations to the child's caseworker after each health care encounter. Child welfare professionals can assist with determining who has the authority to consent for health care services on behalf of the child and can familiarize pediatricians with specific consent guidelines, including those regarding the prescription of psychotropic medications, when applicable. Adolescents in foster care have the same rights to confidential services as other teenagers.

### Prescription adaptation services: a regulatory and practice perspective [^17111d30]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

"Prescription adaptation services" refers to the ability of a pharmacist to autonomously "adapt" an existing prescription when the action is intended to optimize the therapeutic outcome. Adaptation services typically fall into 2 categories: (1) renewals and (2) changes. Renewals ensure continuity of care for patients and may be emergency renewals (typically 72 hours) or continuation-of-therapy renewals (typically 90 or more days). Changes include therapeutic substitutions or changes to quantity, formulation, route of administration, dose/interval, and completing missing information. With an appropriate framework in place, adaptation services can safely optimize medication therapy outcomes while promoting efficiencies.

### ABC of prescribing exercise as medicine: a narrative review of the experiences of general practitioners and patients [^fc62c86d]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Synthesis

Synthesising the findings from the studies under review in the context of the research question, the authors propose the ABC approach to EP, illustrated in figure 1. The process commences with an assessment that could be carried out by a trained physician or practice nurse. This initial 'assessment' includes risk stratification in relation to undertaking the EP, assessment of readiness to change and self-efficacy, as well as exercise preference. The second step is delivering the 'brief intervention' by a trained GP or practice nurse. This should be tailored to the daily life of the individualand should include written instructions on the frequency, intensity, type, timing and progression the EP. It should be accompanied by clear explanations, as well as practical strategies such as goal setting and motivational interviewing. Each step should be deliverable in a 15-minute appointment. The third step, 'continued support', involves a regular process conducted in-person or via telephone. The support involves adjusting or 'renewing' the prescriptionand offering motivationand counselling, and could be implemented by a physiotherapist, other exercise professionalor the GP or nurse.

The ABC (assessment, brief intervention and continued support) approach to exercise prescribing.

The process is enabled by practice-based supports, including: the availability of validated training and resources; tools for assessment and prescription; and the use of mHealth, including pedometers. It involves a shift in thinking, including collaboration with exercise professionalsand re-orientating the general practice environment towards a culture of exercise promotion. At a societal level, supports include developing infrastructure and peer networks.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^6c7088d6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Guidelines have the potential to support deprescribing, yet historically, they have included limited deprescribing recommendations. Over the last decade, medication-class-specific deprescribing guidelines have been developed, but their recommendations have not yet been integrated into treatment guidelines. Additionally, despite language being recognised as a core determinant of guideline implementability, there is limited evidence on whether the language of deprescribing recommendations is clear and actionable, facilitating safe and effective deprescribing in practice. This review aimed to identify guidelines containing deprescribing recommendations, qualitatively explore the content and format of deprescribing recommendations and estimate the proportion of guidelines that contain deprescribing recommendations.

### Association of advisory committee votes with US food and drug administration decision-making on prescription drugs, 2010–2021 [^d9c10c49]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Meeting Characteristics

Meeting minutes were reviewed, and meetings were categorized by whether the committee voted on an initial approval, a supplemental indication, the withdrawal of a drug or indication granted accelerated approval, a safety action, or a different regulatory action or did not vote on a regulatory action. This categorization was consistent with methods used in prior studies, and did not require double-coding, as it involved minimal subjective judgment.

Initial approval was defined as a question that directly considered approval of a new drug, using language such as "safety and efficacy" or "risk-benefit profile" or questions such as, "Does the evidence support approval?" or "Should approval be delayed?" The initial approval category included all New Drug Applications and Biologics License Applications.

Supplemental indication was defined as a question that directly considered approval of an additional indication for an approved drug, using language such as "favorable risk-benefit profile." This category included all supplemental New Drug Applications and supplemental Biologics License Applications, as well as questions considering whether to grant an over-the-counter indication for an already approved drug.

Safety action was defined as a question that directly considered an affirmative safety action for an approved drug, including withdrawal of a drug or indication, addition of a contraindication or warning to the drug label, or implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), using language such as "Should a REMS be imposed?" or "Should the product be removed?"

Recommendations and Corresponding FDA Action

Outcomes of votes on regulatory questions were recorded using meeting minutes. The majority outcome of the vote was recorded as the recommendation of the committee. Corresponding FDA actions were determined using FDA announcements and press releases, drug labels and approvals at Drugs@FDA, the REMS database, and internet searches for industry publications and company press releases.

For meetings considering initial approval, overall approval questions using language such as "risk-benefit" or questions such as "Should it be approved?" were prioritized if available over questions asking about safety or efficacy separately. In meetings with multiple votes, a single question for which the committee voted in favor of an indication, approval for any use, or safety action was considered sufficient to be considered a positive vote.

### Prescription and dispensing duration of medicines for hypertension and other chronic conditions: a review of international policies and evidence to inform the Australian setting [^0165c67b]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We searched the PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles since January 1st, 1990, up to September 1st, 2023, using the search terms 'prescription duration'[title], 'duration prescriptions'[title], 'prescription length'[title], 'prescription period'[title], 'extended prescription'[title], 'repeat prescription'[title], 'repeat prescribing'[title], and 'dispensing duration'[title]. In addition, for a selection of countries, we also searched for and asked national health care authorities or local experts via e-mail regarding dispensing and prescription duration limitations based on legislation, health service guidelines, and subsidy programme regulations. To achieve a representative sample, we included the world's 5 most populous countries, as well as the most populous country from each continent. We also included at least 10 countries with comparable healthcare systems with subsidised access to medicines, as in Australia. Other countries were included based on accessibility of information online, responsiveness by national health care authorities, or connections with local experts.

In this paper we define 'prescription duration' as the entire period of treatment, based on the quantity of medication, for which a healthcare provider may prescribe a medication (which may or may not include several repeat dispensings), and 'dispensing duration' as the period of treatment for which a pharmacist may dispense the medication at a single time point (Fig. 1). Although these time periods are varyingly defined in days, weeks, months, or years, we will specify prescription durations in the approximate number of months, and dispensing durations in the approximate number of days, as these are the most used units of time in regulatory frameworks. Duration limitations of various countries and regions described in this paper are based on legislation, guidelines, subsidy programmes, and/or in some cases customs, and thus are not always comparable, but rather intended as an overview of the global heterogeneity. Finally, limitations on maximum dispensing or prescription durations may differ from the most used durations because of factors such as culture, customs, local clinical practice and financial or medication supply related constraints, which may result in shorter durations; and medicines package sizes, which may result in either shorter or longer durations.

### Indication documentation and indication-based prescribing within electronic prescribing systems: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^b2355ea5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Indication documentation and indication-based prescribing interventions are being implemented and evaluated across numerous healthcare settings. For some outcomes, studies report a mostly positive impact, particularly for appropriateness of prescribing and prescribing errors. Improvements are required to better integrate indication documentation into prescribing workflows in a way that is acceptable to prescribers and enables accurate indication documentation. In turn, this should facilitate safer prescribing and onward use of indication information to aid communication, decision-making and education for healthcare professionals and patients.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 2 travelers with additional considerations [^5859fe6b]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Pre-travel preparation for travelers with chronic conditions — clinical advising and logistics emphasize that having 1 or more chronic health conditions does not usually mean "do not travel," and healthcare professionals should advise patients with chronic conditions to seek pre-travel consultation before paying for non-refundable trips and to do so at least 4–6 weeks before departure. Adequate preparation requires the active participation of the traveler, their primary healthcare professional, and their disease-related specialists, in addition to their travel medicine specialist, and together they should take into consideration the destination, duration, and modes of travel, planned activities, time of year of the planned travel, and airline- and cruise-specific specifications. Assist the traveler with chronic conditions to prepare up to 4–6 weeks in advance of travel, ensure that the traveler has medications for the entire trip plus extra in case of unexpected delays, discuss when to take medications if travel involves changes in time zones, and note that all medications should be carried in hand luggage rather than in checked baggage; discuss vaccine and medication/prescription side effects and possible interactions with their current daily medication regimens and recommend medication or dosing schedule modifications as needed.

### Difference in medication adherence between patients prescribed a 30-day versus 90-day supply after acute myocardial infarction [^50fe9a84]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Provider prescribing practices and concerns for medication switching, dose titration, and prescription waste may be one of the reasons why so few patients who are post‐MI and treated with PCI received 90‐day prescription fills. Interestingly, we found that among those patients filling 30‐day prescriptions, > 9 of 10 patients did not have a medication or dose change within the first month, and generally 2 of 3 patients did not have a change in their EBM class during the year following their index MI discharge. If there were medication or dosing changes, the majority of patients just had 1 change, and these changes typically occurred early after discharge. In addition, prior studies have demonstrated that 90‐day fills of medications, such as statins, antihypertensives, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and oral hypoglycemics, are associated with comparable prescription waste but overall cost savings when compared with 30‐day fills. 13 Even if the discharge provider is hesitant to send patients out with 90‐day fills of the recommended EBMs, the follow‐up outpatient providers should feel reassured in converting patients who are on stable regimens of post‐MI EBMs from 30‐day to 90‐day fills. As most of these medications are recommended by the current guidelines for at least 1 year, 1 discharging providers and postdischarge outpatient providers should consider prescribing 90‐day fills or converting 30‐day to 90‐day fills to potentially mitigate the risks of hospital readmission and cardiovascular mortality.
