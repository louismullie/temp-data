## Question

Treatment for UTI in pregnant patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of urinary tract infections in pregnancy, including asymptomatic bacteriuria, symptomatic cystitis, and pyelonephritis, with attention to screening, antibiotic selection, duration, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and maternal–fetal risks to frame why we treat. Then, I should verify screening recommendations and diagnostic thresholds. Next, I will examine treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, followed by symptomatic cystitis, and then pyelonephritis. After that, I need to check antibiotic safety in pregnancy and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will review follow-up, test-of-cure, and prophylaxis for recurrent infection, and I will reconcile areas of evolving evidence and guideline differences before summarizing practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. UTIs are common in pregnancy, with asymptomatic bacteriuria in roughly 2–7% and symptomatic infections in about 8% of pregnancies, and untreated bacteriuria carries a substantial risk of progression to pyelonephritis, historically up to 20–30%, though contemporary risk appears lower in some settings, which still justifies screening and treatment given the maternal and fetal morbidity associated with pyelonephritis, including sepsis, preterm birth, and low birth weight [^115ycTny] [^113y76kv] [^113R6hZ5].

> Wait, let me verify screening recommendations before jumping to treatment. The USPSTF gives a Grade B recommendation for universal screening of pregnant persons once with urine culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12–16 weeks, and IDSA similarly recommends screening and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, reflecting moderate net benefit in reducing pyelonephritis and possibly low birth weight, despite the evidence being older and largely indirect [^116cc9Lu] [^113rbwQY] [^116pPSDe]. I should confirm diagnostic thresholds: a single uropathogen at ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL is positive, and for group B Streptococcus, ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL is commonly used as a treatment threshold in pregnancy, with culture as the gold standard and midstream clean-catch technique recommended [^117CjqAr] [^113rbwQY].

> Hold on, let's not conflate screening with treatment effects. I need to check the magnitude of benefit from treating screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria. Pooled randomized and observational data suggest about a 76% reduction in pyelonephritis and a smaller reduction in low birth weight with treatment, though much of the trial evidence is old and at high risk of bias, and contemporary cohorts show lower baseline pyelonephritis risk, which tempers the absolute benefit but still supports screening and treatment given the potential severity of pyelonephritis in pregnancy [^116zsERV] [^11186Wzo] [^115ycTny].

> Next, I should review treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. IDSA suggests 4–7 days of antimicrobial therapy rather than shorter courses, and comparative data indicate that short-course therapy outperforms single-dose regimens for microbiologic cure, with a notable signal that 7 days of nitrofurantoin reduced low birth weight compared with single-dose therapy, supporting a 5–7 day approach as standard in pregnancy [^116pPSDe] [^116aPaVB] [^114Wk6bV]. Let me consider agents: nitrofurantoin, beta-lactams such as cephalexin or amoxicillin, and fosfomycin are acceptable choices guided by local resistance and culture results, with nitrofurantoin and beta-lactams favored for their safety profile in pregnancy [^114Wk6bV] [^113R6hZ5].

> I will now examine symptomatic cystitis. For acute uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy, I should confirm that empiric therapy should be guided by local resistance patterns and culture when feasible, with nitrofurantoin, beta-lactams, and fosfomycin as reasonable options, and I should avoid agents contraindicated in pregnancy such as fluoroquinolones and be cautious with TMP-SMX in the first trimester unless alternatives are unsuitable [^113R6hZ5] [^113y76kv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 3-day course might suffice based on nonpregnant data, but I should double-check pregnancy-specific guidance; in pregnancy, 5–7 days is generally preferred for cystitis to optimize bacteriologic cure, even though symptomatic outcomes with 3 days can be similar in nonpregnant populations, so I should correct toward 5–7 days in pregnancy unless compelling reasons dictate otherwise [^114RLvXD] [^113y76kv].

> Let me consider pyelonephritis carefully because maternal–fetal risk is highest here. I should confirm that most patients require hospitalization and initial parenteral therapy, with third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone as a common first choice, and that combination therapy with an aminoglycoside may be added in severe cases or when resistance is suspected, followed by step-down to oral beta-lactams to complete a total of 10–14 days, with close monitoring for sepsis, preterm labor, and clinical deterioration [^113R6hZ5] [^113y76kv]. Hold on, I should verify imaging indications; if there is poor response or concern for obstruction or abscess, renal ultrasound is appropriate in pregnancy, while CT is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary, aligning with radiology appropriateness guidance [^113GGCdL].

> I need to ensure antibiotic safety in pregnancy is front and center. Fluoroquinolones should be avoided due to fetal cartilage toxicity risk, TMP-SMX is generally avoided in the first trimester because of associations with congenital malformations in some cohorts, and nitrofurantoin is acceptable except near term due to theoretical neonatal hemolysis risk, with beta-lactams and fosfomycin remaining preferred options when appropriate, and stewardship principles emphasizing narrow-spectrum therapy once susceptibilities return [^114Wk6bV] [^1125XBvn] [^113R6hZ5]. But wait, what if resistance is high locally for nitrofurantoin or beta-lactams? In that case, I should tailor empiric choices to local antibiograms and promptly de-escalate based on culture results to minimize collateral damage and resistance selection [^114Wk6bV].

> Next, I should review follow-up and test-of-cure. I should confirm that a urine culture is recommended 1–2 weeks after completing therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis in pregnancy to document eradication, given recurrence rates up to one third in some series, and that any recurrence warrants repeat culture and evaluation for anatomic or behavioral contributors, with consideration of suppressive prophylaxis in select high-risk patients after a single UTI in pregnancy [^113y76kv] [^111Zt4nH]. Hold on, I should verify that routine test-of-cure is not universally mandated for every symptomatic cystitis if the patient is clinically well, but in pregnancy many clinicians obtain a follow-up culture given the stakes of recurrence and progression, which is reasonable and consistent with obstetric practice patterns [^113y76kv].

> I will now examine prevention of recurrent UTIs in pregnancy. Evidence for non-antibiotic measures is limited and heterogeneous, though hygiene strategies are reasonable and safe, and for patients with recurrent UTIs or high-risk features, low-dose prophylaxis with agents such as nitrofurantoin may be considered after shared decision-making, recognizing that high-quality pregnancy-specific prophylaxis data are sparse and that any prophylaxis should be individualized and time-limited when possible [^115ZwWjB] [^114tYHuA] [^111Zt4nH]. Let me reconsider whether cranberry or probiotics have a role; current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use in pregnancy for UTI prevention, so I should not overstate their benefit [^114tYHuA].

> But wait, what about evolving evidence and dissenting views on screening asymptomatic bacteriuria. Some recent analyses and proposals question the magnitude of benefit in modern low-risk populations with good prenatal care, citing lower baseline pyelonephritis risk and potential harms from antibiotics, yet major guidelines still endorse screening given historical reductions in pyelonephritis and plausible benefits for neonatal outcomes, albeit with moderate certainty and acknowledgment of evidence limitations [^113B37jT] [^114x3fzL] [^116cc9Lu]. I should double-check that this means practice remains aligned with USPSTF and IDSA while we await contemporary trials, and that clinicians should individualize decisions in special populations and document shared decision-making when deviating from guideline-concordant screening [^116cc9Lu] [^116pPSDe].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations to ensure nothing is missed. Screen all pregnant persons once with urine culture at the first prenatal visit or 12–16 weeks, treat asymptomatic bacteriuria for 5–7 days with nitrofurantoin or a beta-lactam guided by culture, treat symptomatic cystitis for 5–7 days with nitrofurantoin, a beta-lactam, or fosfomycin while avoiding fluoroquinolones and being cautious with TMP-SMX in the first trimester, manage pyelonephritis with hospitalization and parenteral ceftriaxone often with an aminoglycoside in severe cases for a total of 10–14 days, obtain a test-of-cure culture 1–2 weeks after therapy for ASB or cystitis, and consider suppressive prophylaxis for recurrent infections or high-risk patients, adjusting all choices to local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^113rbwQY] [^114Wk6bV] [^113R6hZ5] [^113y76kv] [^111Zt4nH].

---

Treat UTIs in pregnancy with **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days** [^113R6hZ5] or **cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 5–7 days** as first-line therapy [^113R6hZ5]. Use **fosfomycin 3 g PO once** if these are unsuitable or resistance is present [^112eW7ZK]. Avoid **fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the first trimester**; use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole only after 20 weeks if no alternatives exist [^notfound]. For pyelonephritis, hospitalize and give IV ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside, then step down to oral therapy to complete 10–14 days [^113R6hZ5]. Always obtain a urine culture before treatment, repeat a culture 1–2 weeks after therapy, and monitor for adverse effects and recurrence [^112BrR2C].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Urine culture**: Obtain a midstream, clean-catch urine culture [^117CjqAr] at the first prenatal visit or 12–16 weeks gestation [^113rbwQY] to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) [^1163edf9].

- **Diagnostic thresholds**: ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen [^117CjqAr] indicates infection; ≥ 10,000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus warrants treatment [^113rbwQY].

- **Follow-up culture**: Repeat culture 1–2 weeks after completing therapy to confirm eradication [^notfound].

## Antibiotic selection and safety considerations

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Safety profile** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | Safe in pregnancy; avoid at term due to neonatal hemolysis risk | First-line for uncomplicated cystitis and ASB [^114Wk6bV] |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg PO QID for 5–7 days | Safe throughout pregnancy | First-line alternative [^113R6hZ5] |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g PO once | Safe; limited pregnancy data | Option for resistant organisms or intolerance [^112eW7ZK] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Avoid in first trimester; use after 20 weeks if necessary | Teratogenic risk in first trimester | Use only if no alternatives [^112ph6V3] |
| Fluoroquinolones | Contraindicated | Cartilage toxicity risk | Avoid during pregnancy [^112mYXUQ] |

## Management of specific UTI types

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB)

For asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), **screening and treatment** are recommended [^113nqUSu] to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm birth [^1144U2MN]. Use **nitrofurantoin or cephalexin for 5–7 days** [^114Wk6bV], and arrange a follow-up culture to confirm eradication [^112BrR2C].

---

### Uncomplicated cystitis

For uncomplicated cystitis, **first-line therapy** is nitrofurantoin or cephalexin for 5–7 days [^notfound]. Fosfomycin is an alternative when first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance is present [^117BsxsL].

---

### Pyelonephritis

For pyelonephritis, **hospitalization and IV therapy** with ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside are indicated [^111cqEBQ]. Transition to oral therapy to complete a total of 10–14 days, and monitor closely for maternal and fetal complications [^116cc9Lu].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include a **test-of-cure culture** 1–2 weeks after therapy [^113nqUSu] and surveillance for adverse effects — including gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare hepatotoxicity with nitrofurantoin. Counsel patients on recurrence risk and hygiene measures to reduce recurrence [^114tYHuA].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **recurrent UTIs**, for which prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. nightly nitrofurantoin) may be considered after individualized risk–benefit assessment [^111Zt4nH]. Antibiotic resistance should guide empiric therapy based on local patterns, with therapy adjusted to culture results [^117H4oaD]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, hydration, and prompt reporting of recurrent symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Screening**: Universal screening for ASB at the first prenatal visit or 12–16 weeks gestation [^113rbwQY].

- **First-line therapy**: Nitrofurantoin or cephalexin for 5–7 days for uncomplicated cystitis and ASB [^notfound].

- **Pyelonephritis**: Hospitalization, IV ceftriaxone or aminoglycoside, then oral therapy to complete 10–14 days [^notfound].

- **Avoid**: Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the first trimester [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Test-of-cure culture 1–2 weeks after therapy [^notfound].

---

UTI management in pregnancy centers on **safe, effective antibiotics** — nitrofurantoin or cephalexin for 5–7 days — with culture-guided therapy and close follow-up to ensure eradication and prevent complications [^114Wk6bV].

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10 2 colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^113uZNBM]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for implementation: urinary tract infection

We recommend temporary discontinuation of SGLT-2 inhibitors when treating acute pyelonephritis or urosepsis (Grade 1C).

Rationale

Randomised data from major trials show the increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) with SGLT-2 inhibitors is small. However, these drugs are being prescribed in people who have a high risk of UTIs and effective prompt management of these infections should be undertaken.

Recommendations for implementation: children, pregnancy and breastfeeding

We suggest that all women of child-bearing potential are counselled, prior to conception, on the risks of SGLT-2 inhibitors during pregnancy (Grade 2D).
We suggest SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy is discontinued upon planning, suspicion or confirmation of pregnancy (Grade 2D).
We suggest SGLT-2 inhibitors are not used in women who are breastfeeding (Grade 2D).

Rationale

There is theoretical evidence to advise against using these drugs in people either planning pregnancy, who become pregnant or who are breastfeeding. Clinical trials in the paediatric setting are suggested.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^111vcB7Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An amount of ≥ 10 5 bacteria per mL of freshly voided urine and the absence of typical symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) is referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). The reported prevalence rates in pregnancy range from 2 to 15%. Generally a benign condition in most adults, in pregnant women ASB has been associated with an increased risk of complications, especially upper UTIs (pyelonephritis) and preterm birth.

While pyelonephritis normally requires hospitalisation and sometimes leads to severe complications such as sepsis and respiratory problems, preterm birth is the main contributor to infant morbidity and mortality. Most clinical practice guidelines therefore recommend screening for and antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnancy. In most health care systems a screening programme for ASB in pregnancy has long been part of routine maternal care.

These recommendations are based on data published in the 1960s to 1980s and summarised in an update of a Cochrane Review on the antibiotic treatment of ASB in August 2015. Our systematic review had an extended scope comprising three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, in case no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

This systematic review is an update of a health technology assessment report of the benefits and harms of screening for ASB in pregnancy conducted by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG).

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^112mYXUQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Whilst antibiotics are vital in eradication of UTIs, antimicrobial resistance due to their use is a global health threat. Antimicrobial resistance means that bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment and cause serious or life threatening infections. Use of antibiotics is strongly associated with increasing emergence of resistant bacteria and subsequent redundancy of antibiotics i.e. previously effective antibiotics are losing their efficacy. Unlike the general population, the choice of safe antibiotics in pregnancy is limited because of teratogenic potential e.g. quinolones should be avoided in pregnancy because of a risk of joint malformations in the foetus. Therefore antibiotics becoming ineffective due to antimicrobial resistance is a particular concern in pregnancy as it further limits the range of drugs available to treat infections safely. An example of this in practice is the replacement of trimethoprim with nitrofurantoin as the first line antibiotic to treat UTIs because of an increase in resistance due to its widespread use in the UK. Use of antibiotics can also result in carriage of resistant bacteria by individuals for a period of several months to a year after completing a course of antibiotics. The resistant bacteria can transfer to close physical contacts and may colonise and infect subsequent hosts. This is especially of concern in pregnancy as women can pass on resistant bacteria to the neonate during birth, which is when they are most vulnerable to infection. An example of resistance specific to obstetric practice is the increase in ampicillin resistant neonatal infections due to maternal use of ampicillin.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections-United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. † For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available, though the current estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The current estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study that examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999 found that the antibiotics most commonly dispensed within 3 days of a nonrecurrent episode of cystitis were fluoroquinolones (32%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (37%), and nitrofurantoin (16%). A recent study using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to examine > 7,000 outpatient visits for UTIs among women aged ≥ 18 years from 2002 to 2011 found that 80% were prescribed antibiotics within 7 days of diagnosis; the most commonly prescribed medications were fluoroquinolones (39%), sulfonamides (22%), and nitrofurantoin (15%). By comparison, in the current analysis, women with UTIs during the 3 months before LMP were most often dispensed ciprofloxacin (25.5%), nitrofurantoin (24.0%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (18.7%).

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I² = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I² = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I² = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I² = 0%).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113GFY7m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

### Single-dose antibiotic therapy for urinary infections during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112eW7ZK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, urinary infections are an important cause of maternofetal morbidity and mortality and may lead to several complications.

Objective

To verify whether the use of antibiotic therapy in a single dose when compared with multiple doses in lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy is effective to obtain microbiologic cure.

Search Strategy

Online databases were searched. Keywords used were "single-drug dose", "antibiotic", "fosfomycin", "amoxicillin", "trimethoprim", "pregnancy", and "urinary tract infection".

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials, the population was pregnant woman, microbiologic cure was attained, and one of the treatment groups received single-dose antibiotic therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Preselected studies have been independently read by pairs, and data were extracted according to a predetermined sheet. The Cochrane tool was used for the risk of bias.

Main Results

A total of 1063 women from nine studies were included. The primary outcome was the microbiologic cure attested by urine culture. When compared with the multiple-day use of antibiotics, the single-dose treatment has shown statistically similar results in reaching culture cure (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.44).

Conclusion

The current study has shown that the use of single-dose treatment for lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy can be recommended, especially using fosfomycin.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113k9V86]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

ASB — general management and indications for screening/treatment: A recent systematic review concluded that antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) does not appear to improve microbiologic outcomes, morbidity, or mortality, and current evidence indicates that screening/treatment of ASB does not reduce urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, morbidity, or mortality in patients with complicating factors. In a large cohort of hospitalized patients with ASB and no systemic signs of infections, female patients without vital sign abnormalities or leukocytosis had a predicted probability of bacteremia of 2% or less. The only clearly recognized indications for screening/treatment of ASB are 1) pregnant women, and 2) patients undergoing elective urologic surgery, and symptoms such as malodorous and/or cloudy urine, although associated with bacteriuria, do not warrant treatment.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116cc9Lu]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among the general adult population, women (across all ages) have the highest prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with age among both men and women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women. Among pregnant persons, pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth.

Objective

To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults, including pregnant persons.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications. There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment and changes in the microbiome) to be at least small in magnitude. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no net benefit. The known harms associated with treatment include adverse effects of antibiotic use and changes to the microbiome. Based on these known harms, the USPSTF determined the overall harms to be at least small in this group.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening pregnant persons for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. (D recommendation).

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115Zs6K2]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

### First-trimester antibiotic use for urinary tract infection and risk of congenital malformations [^1125XBvn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clinical guidelines recommend screening and treating bacteriuria in early pregnancy given that urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause serious maternal and neonatal consequences. Evidence regarding antibiotic exposure during early pregnancy and risk of congenital malformations is limited and inconsistent.

Objective

To compare the risk of congenital malformations following first-trimester exposure to different antibiotic agents used to treat UTI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included commercially insured pregnant individuals aged 15 to 49 years who were treated for UTI and linked liveborn infants in the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database (2006–2022).

Exposure

First-trimester antibiotic prescription fill of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin), and β-lactams to treat UTI.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Congenital malformations (any and by organ system) were identified using validated algorithms based on diagnosis codes up to 365 days after birth. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate propensity score-weighted risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences.

Results

The cohort of 71 604 eligible pregnancies (median maternal [IQR] age, 30 [27–34] years) included 42 402 (59.2%) nitrofurantoin-exposed, 3494 (4.9%) TMP-SMX-exposed, 3663 (5.1%) fluoroquinolone-exposed, and 22 045 (30.8%) β-lactam-exposed individuals. Median (IQR) gestational age differed by antibiotic (nitrofurantoin, 62 [45–77] days; TMP-SMX, 26 [13–59] days; fluoroquinolones, 18 [9–27] days; β-lactams, 63 [48–77] days). The absolute risk of any malformation was 19.8 (95% CI, 18.0–21.8) per 1000 infants for β-lactams, 21.2 (95% CI, 19.9–22.7) per 1000 infants for nitrofurantoin, 23.5 (95% CI, 18.8–28.9) per 1000 infants for fluoroquinolones, and 26.9 (95% CI, 21.8–32.8) per 1000 infants for TMP-SMX. After accounting for confounding, risk of any congenital malformation was higher for TMP-SMX (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.75) but similar for nitrofurantoin (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00–1.26) and fluoroquinolones (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.87–1.60) compared with β-lactams. TMP-SMX was associated with increased risk of severe cardiac malformations (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.09–3.99), other cardiac malformations (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02–2.25), and cleft lip and palate (RR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.44–7.22) compared with β-lactams; however, for these specific malformations, the corresponding risk difference estimates included the null. Risk of other malformation types did not differ by agent, although some estimates were imprecise. Results were generally consistent across sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of first-trimester antibiotic exposure, the risk of any malformation, severe cardiac malformation, other cardiac malformation, and cleft lip and palate was higher for infants exposed to TMP-SMX vs β-lactam antibiotics. No elevated risk was observed for nitrofurantoin.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112BrR2C]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others on asymptomatic bacteriuria screening — positions across organizations — note support for screening in pregnancy by infectious disease and obstetric groups, mixed guidance on timing, and broad recommendations against screening in nonpregnant adults. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America's recommendations for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and treatment for those who screen positive. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening in pregnant women with urine culture once during the first trimester, although this was issued as a "weak" recommendation and the quality of evidence was considered "low". The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has no specific recommendation to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons; however, the AAP recommends that clinicians treat pregnant persons and perform a test of cure if asymptomatic bacteriuria is found to be present on a urine culture. In 2008, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended screening in pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit, whichever comes first. The AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence all recommend against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant, premenopausal women.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Three-day vs longer duration of antibiotic treatment for cystitis in women: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UPGpc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We performed a meta-analysis to ascertain the efficacy and safety of the currently practiced 3-day antibiotic therapy for cystitis versus prolonged therapy (5 days or longer) to relieve symptoms and to achieve bacteriological cure.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing 3-day oral antibiotic therapy with prolonged therapy (5 days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in adult non-pregnant women. Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data. Relative risks (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated; a fixed effect model was used. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed whenever possible.

Results

Thirty-two trials and 9605 patients met inclusion criteria. For symptomatic failure rates no difference between 3-day and prolonged antibiotic regimens was found at short term (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.96–1.41) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.99–1.38). Three-day treatment was less effective than prolonged therapy in preventing bacteriological failure, relative risk 1.37 (95% CI: 1.07–1.74) for short-term follow-up, and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.22–1.77) for long-term follow-up. Adverse effects were more common in the prolonged therapy group (RR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79–0.91). The results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

Antibiotic therapy for 3 days is similar to prolonged therapy in achieving symptomatic cure for cystitis, while the prolonged treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure.

### Advances in the treatment of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in pregnancy [^117BnNhJ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy is important, given the prevalence of these conditions, associated risks to the mother and fetus /newborn, and potential requirement for antibiotic treatment. Screening for ASB with a urine culture is required during pregnancy, and a positive culture is treated for 5 to 7 days with culture-specific antibiotics. Recent research on non-antibiotic prevention and shortened duration of antibiotic treatment may offer a slightly different approach to ASB and UTI in pregnancy.

### Common bacterial and viral infections: review of management in the pregnant patient [^1145Evi9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the treatment of common bacterial and viral infections occurring in the pregnant patient.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE was performed (inception to October 2018). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website was utilized for additional information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant English-language studies and those conducted in humans were considered.

Data Synthesis

β-Lactams alone or in combination are the preferred treatment for many common infections in pregnancy, such as urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), gonococcal infections, syphilis, chancroid, upper- and lower-respiratory-tract infections, certain gastrointestinal infections, Group B Streptococcus, listeriosis, and intrauterine inflammation or infection. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, are also utilized for the treatment of PID, chlamydia, gonococcal infections, chancroid, community-acquired pneumonia, and certain gastrointestinal infections. Other antibiotics or antivirals such as vancomycin, aminoglycosides, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, acyclovir, valacyclovir, and oseltamivir are included in the preferred therapy for some common bacterial and viral infections in pregnant patients as well. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review synthesizes available evidence of treatments of common infections in pregnancy and provides a concise summary to guide clinicians on empirical treatment during pregnancy.

Conclusions

There are limited data on clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with common bacterial and viral infections. Empirical management decisions require balance of benefit and risk to both mother and infant. Although few clinical practice guidelines have quality evidence for strong recommendations in this population, clinicians should weigh antimicrobial dosing, pharmacokinetics, safety, and established effectiveness to optimize antimicrobial therapy in pregnancy.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113rbwQY]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinician summary for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults — For pregnant persons, Grade B: Screen persons who are pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture, and for nonpregnant adults, Grade D: Do not screen adults who are not pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening in pregnancy is implemented using a midstream, clean-catch urine culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation, whichever is earlier; a urine culture showing > 100 000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen or > 10 000 CFU/mL if the pathogen is group B Streptococcus indicates treatment. This applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. It does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions or are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^113HpXJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies and, if not treated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (19 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Fourteen studies, involving almost 2000 women, were included. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment reduced the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 11 studies, 1932 women; very low quality evidence). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; six studies, 1437 babies; low quality evidence) and preterm birth (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; two studies, 242 women; low quality evidence). A reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery was seen (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; four studies; 596 women). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, all 14 studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias. While many studies lacked an adequate description of methods and the risk of bias could only be assessed as unclear, in almost all studies there was at least one domain where the risk of bias was judged as high. The three primary outcomes were assessed with GRADE software and given a quality rating. Evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth and birthweight less than 2500 g was assessed as of low or very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

While antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, the estimate of the effect is very uncertain because of the very low quality of the evidence. The reduction in low birthweight and preterm birth with antibiotic treatment is consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this association should be interpreted with caution given the very poor quality of the included studies.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113BjkNG]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — pregnant persons versus nonpregnant adults: Urine culture is the established method for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria. In pregnant persons, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria reduces the incidence of pyelonephritis, the overall benefits can be bounded as no greater than moderate in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has a moderate net benefit. In nonpregnant adults, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria has no benefit, overall harms can be bounded as at least small in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no benefit and may be harmful.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1163edf9]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and update of recommendation — pregnancy and nonpregnant adults: Pregnant persons with asymptomatic bacteriuria usually receive antibiotic therapy, based on urine culture results and follow-up monitoring. In this update, the USPSTF continues to recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons with urine culture and recommends against screening in nonpregnant adults; the USPSTF changed the grade for pregnant persons from an "A" to a "B". Since 1996, the USPSTF has maintained an "A" recommendation for 1-time screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant persons between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1157Pdfw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, and screening for this condition in pregnant women is a well-established, evidence-based standard of current medical practice. Screening other groups of adults has not been shown to improve outcomes.

Purpose

To review new and substantial evidence on screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, to support the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

English-language studies of adults (age > 18 years) indexed in PubMed and the Cochrane Library and published from 1 January 2002 through 30 April 2007.

Study Selection

For benefits of screening or treatment for screened populations, systematic reviews; meta-analyses; and randomized, controlled trials were included. For harms of screening, systematic reviews; meta-analyses; randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; and case series of large multisite databases were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full articles for inclusion.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data from studies on benefits of screening and treatment (including decreases in the incidence of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, symptomatic urinary tract infections, hypertension, and renal function decline).

Data Synthesis

An updated Cochrane systematic review of 14 randomized, controlled trials of treatment supports screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. A randomized, controlled trial and a prospective cohort study show that screening nonpregnant women with diabetes for asymptomatic bacteriuria is unlikely to produce benefits. No new evidence on screening men for asymptomatic bacteriuria or on harms of screening was found.

Limitation

The focused search strategy may have missed some smaller studies on the benefits and harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Conclusion

The available evidence continues to support screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women, but not in other groups of adults.

### Urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114ECUNE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are relatively common in pregnancy and may result in significant morbidity for the pregnant woman and fetus. The authors recommend that all pregnant women be screened for the presence of bacteriuria at their first prenatal visit. Failure to treat bacteriuria during pregnancy may result in as many as 25% of women experiencing acute pyelonephritis. Women with acute pyelonephritis may sustain significant complications, such as preterm labor, transient renal failure, ARDS, sepsis and shock, and hematologic abnormalities. Pregnant women with urinary tract infections should be followed up closely after treatment because as many as one third will experience a recurrence.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^116w1MMp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

No studies were identified on the primary research question, the benefit of screening for ASB versus no screening.

Four RCTs, of which three had a high risk of bias, included data on 454 patients and provided limited information on the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment for women with ASB. Data collected more than 50 years ago indicate a reduction in the risk of UTIs and pyelonephritis for women receiving antibiotic treatment, whereas recent results of a high-quality RCT failed to show any statistically significant difference.

The inconsistent results and the fact that three studies were conducted more than 50 years earlier than the most recent study raise the question of the applicability of their findings.

Applicability

As the screening tests used in Mulla were not described, it is not known how women who benefited from treatment were identified. In Williams et al. the above-mentioned interventions preceding the relevant trial caused urinary concentration, an increase in the risk of nosocomial infections, and a delay in treatment. The setting created differs considerably from current routine maternity care and may interact with the UTI outcomes described below. This means that, although both trials suggest a preventive effect of treatment of ASB with regard to upper and lower UTI, the results do not allow conclusions to be drawn about today's pregnant women in current health care settings. This is also reflected in the results of the study by Kazemier et al. Consequently, the benefit of treatment of ASB to prevent upper and lower UTI is regarded as not proven.

Besides, further aspects challenge the applicability of the three studies from the 1960s. None of them contained details on age, parity, previous and concomitant diseases, and sociodemographic data of the study population. It was thus difficult to judge comparability with today's pregnant women. Factors that have undergone considerable changes since the 1960s and may influence the effects of treatment of ASB include the content and scope of routine maternal care services, the general health status and demographic characteristics of pregnant women, as well as the further development of diagnostic procedures. In summary, these factors have resulted in a lower baseline risk of pyelonephritis.

The study medication in the three studies from the 1960s consisted primarily of sulphonamides, while only the recent Dutch study used nitrofurantoin, a drug currently used as a first-line treatment option for ASB.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114swyqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which agent is the most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (November 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered all trials where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 10 studies, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between the treatments under study with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. When cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, there were better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and fewer recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group. There was only one other statistically significant difference when comparing outpatient versus inpatient treatment. Gestational age at birth was greater in women from the outpatient group (38.86 versus 37.21), while birthweight was on average greater in the inpatient group (3120 versus 2659).

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117CjqAr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy-qualitative analysis of online forum content [^111iwEA9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy can increase the susceptibility of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women because of physiological changes. The vast majority of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK are for UTIs which suggests a high prevalence. Evidence from studies shows that asymptomatic infection alone can affect 2–12% of women. The current management of UTIs in pregnancy is with a short course of antibiotics whether or not the infection is symptomatic. Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is diagnosed and treated through routine screening during the first trimester which is in contrast to non-pregnant women where asymptomatic infections are not treated with antibiotics. ASB is treated in pregnancy because studies have shown that bacterial colonisation of the urinary tract in pregnancy can cause adverse health outcomes e.g. there are risks of kidney infection, intra-uterine growth retardation and pre-term birth. The authors of a recent randomised control trial however have questioned the benefit of routine screening for ASB in the first trimester of pregnancy. Kazemier et al. (2015) found no association between ASB and growth retardation or pre-term birth and although an association was observed between ASB and kidney infection, the absolute risk was found to be low.

Excessive and unnecessary use of antibiotics is strongly associated with a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is the ability of bacteria to survive in spite of antibiotic treatment leading to life threatening infections. There is evidence from the UK and internationally which suggests that antibiotics to treat UTIs are overprescribed in pregnant women. Although AMR is a global public health threat to everyone, in pregnancy it can be particularly concerning due to the risk of resistant bacteria passing on to the neonate during birth which can be a vulnerable stage of life with regards to contracting infections. In addition to this, antibiotic use in pregnancy may also carry the risk of potentially teratogenic effects including spontaneous abortion. Therefore, in light of AMR and the risk of adverse effects from the use of antibiotics, it is important that maternal antibiotic use is appropriate without compromising the health of women if they experience a UTI.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies and, if not treated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm delivery.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on persistent bacteriuria during pregnancy, the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm delivery.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Overall the study quality was poor. Antibiotic treatment compared to placebo or no treatment was effective in clearing asymptomatic bacteriuria (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.48). The incidence of pyelonephritis was reduced (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.41). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight babies (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89) but a difference in preterm delivery was not seen.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. A reduction in low birthweight is consistent with current theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this association should be interpreted with caution given the poor quality of the included studies.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^115pNEnk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 30% of mothers develop acute pyelonephritis if asymptomatic bacteriuria is untreated. Asymptomatic bacteriuria may have a role in preterm birth or it may be a marker for low socioeconomic status which is associated with low birth weight.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on persistent bacteriuria during pregnancy, the risk of preterm delivery, and the development of pyelonephritis.

Search Strategy

I searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. Date of last search: December 2000.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed.

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Overall the study quality was not strong. Antibiotic treatment compared to placebo or no treatment was effective in clearing asymptomatic bacteriuria (odds ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.10). The incidence of pyelonephritis was reduced (odds ratio 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.32). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery or low birth weight babies (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.80).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. An apparent reduction in preterm delivery is consistent with current theories about the role of infection in preterm birth, but this association should be interpreted with caution.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^11186Wzo]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria can identify patients for whom treatment might be beneficial for preventing symptomatic infection and other health outcomes.

Objective

To systematically review benefits and harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment in adults, including during pregnancy, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher-supplied records), and Cochrane Collaboration Central Registry of Controlled Trials; surveillance through May 24, 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies on benefits and harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria; RCTs on benefits and harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment. Eligible populations included unselected, asymptomatic individuals without known urinary tract conditions.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate benefits of the interventions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Symptomatic infection; function, morbidity, mortality; pregnancy complications and birth outcomes.

Results

Nineteen studies (N = 8443) meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Two cohort studies (n = 5289) found fewer cases of pyelonephritis in the cohorts of screened pregnant women (0.5%) than within retrospective comparisons of unscreened cohorts (2.2% and 1.8%); the larger study estimated a statistically significant relative risk of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.15–0.60). No studies examined screening in nonpregnant populations. Among 12 trials of asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment during pregnancy (n = 2377; 1 conducted within past 30 years), there were reduced rates of pyelonephritis (range, 0%-16.5% for the intervention group and 2.2%-36.4% for the control group; pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14–0.40]; 12 trials) and low birth weight (range, 2.5%-14.8% for the intervention group and 6.7%-21.4% for the control group; pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46–0.90]; 7 trials). There was no significant difference in infant mortality (pooled RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.29–3.26]; 6 trials). Five RCTs of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment in nonpregnant adults (n = 777) did not report any significant differences in risk of infection, mobility, or mortality. Limited evidence on harms of screening or treatment was available, and no statistically significant differences were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy was associated with reduced rates of pyelonephritis and low birth weights, but the available evidence was not current, with only 1 study conducted in the past 30 years. Benefits of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment in nonpregnant adult populations were not found. Trial evidence on harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria antibiotic treatment was limited.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113nqUSu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnant women — screening and treatment are advised, with culture timing and therapy duration specified. In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and we suggest a urine culture collected at 1 of the initial visits early in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against repeat screening during the pregnancy after an initial negative culture or after treatment of an initial episode. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Interventions for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection during pregnancy [^115ZwWjB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) are common in women who are pregnant and may cause serious adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child including preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age babies. Interventions used to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non-pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for preventing RUTI in pregnant women. The primary maternal outcomes were RUTI before birth (variously defined) and preterm birth (before 37 weeks). The primary infant outcomes were small-for-gestational age and total mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, clustered-randomised trials and abstracts of any intervention (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for preventing RUTI during pregnancy (compared with another intervention, placebo or with usual care).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias. The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) -113.00, 95% CI -327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five-minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 10³ colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small-for-gestational-age babies were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

A daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance has not been shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone. A significant reduction of ASB was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate and who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. There was limited reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes for both women and infants. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are necessary to investigate potentially effective interventions to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^1123zsv2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

We have to reject the hypothesis of non-inferiority of initial symptomatic treatment, and we cannot generally recommend the ibuprofen first approach. This treatment option, however, can be discussed with women with mild to moderate symptoms in a shared decision making approach or within a strategy of delayed prescription. Future research is needed to identify patients for whom symptomatic treatment is sufficient as it has the potential to considerably reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for women with mild to moderate symptoms of urinary tract infection, in particular those with negative results on culture.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cn9bG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116zsERV]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF asymptomatic bacteriuria — pregnant persons, benefits of screening and treatment: Twelve randomized trials (n = 2,377) in pregnant women were included, and pooled analysis demonstrated a 76% reduction in pyelonephritis among intervention groups (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.40]; 12 studies; n = 2068), with a sensitivity analysis showing a similar reduction (pooled RR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.11–0.34]; 7 studies; n = 1184). Low birth weight incidence was reduced (pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46–0.90]; 7 studies; n = 1522), while for preterm birth and perinatal mortality, results were mixed and pooled estimates did not demonstrate statistical significance. Control-group pyelonephritis rates were higher in older vs more recent trials (7% to 36% vs 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively).

### Urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in pregnancy [^115ngXcq]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bacteriuria during pregnancy may be classified as asymptomatic bacteriuria, infections of the lower urinary tract (cystitis), or infections of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis). Lower tract bacteriuria is associated with an increased risk of developing pyelonephritis in pregnancy, which is itself associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be screened for the presence of bacteriuria early in pregnancy. All bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated, and antimicrobial choice in pregnancy should reflect safety for both the mother and the fetus. After treatment of bacteriuria, patients should be followed closely due to risk of recurrent bacteriuria.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1175EGec]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — prevalence and evidence assessment: Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, which in pregnant persons is linked to perinatal complications; the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications, and treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons, whereas in nonpregnant adults screening for and treatment has no net benefit and the harms associated with treatment (including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment and changes in the microbiome) are at least small in magnitude, with overall harms in this group determined to be at least small.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113kBEib]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research needs and gaps for asymptomatic bacteriuria — priority evidence deficits — highlight the absence of harm studies in nonpregnant adults, limited data on serious outcomes in modern pregnancy, and the need to understand microbiome and antibiotic effects. No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (eg, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been lower in recent decades and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy, and clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments where screening and treatment are not the standard of care or guidelines are changing would be useful. Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies, and for pregnant and nonpregnant populations research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The role of current patterns of antibiotic use is unclear; antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome, and more research is needed to understand potential harms and effects on newborn, child, and longer-term health.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^111cqEBQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult women [^1152Doak]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Almost half of all women will have at least one symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime. Although usually self-remitting, 74% of women contacting a health professional are prescribed an antibiotic, and in rare instances, they may progress to more severe infections. Therefore, the standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs is oral antibiotic therapy, which aims to achieve symptom resolution and prevent the development of complications such as pyelonephritis. Given that a number of UTIs are self-remitting, non-antibiotic treatments that may help reduce the severity or duration of symptoms or reduce the need for antibiotics may be of benefit.

Objectives

This review aims to investigate the benefits and risks associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 18 November 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated UTIs in non-pregnant adult women. The outcomes of interest were: 1) short-term resolution of symptoms (days 1 to 4); 2) medium-term resolution of symptoms (days 5 to 10); and 3) incidence of adverse events (including progression to sepsis or complicated UTI, hospitalisation or need for intravenous antibiotics, gastrointestinal complications, or death) up to 30 days from randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, abstract selection, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors, and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Six studies (1646 randomised women) published between 2010 and 2019 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 28 to 50 years; previous UTIs were reported in 7.2% to 77% of participants. There were five multicentre studies, and studies were carried out in Denmark, Germany, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. Compared to antibiotics, NSAIDs probably result in less short-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1144 participants: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91; I² = 75%; moderate certainty) and may also result in less medium-term resolution of symptoms (4 studies, 1140 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I² = 78%; low certainty). NSAIDs probably make little or no difference to the number of adverse events by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.33; I² = 64%; moderate certainty). NSAIDs may result in longer duration of symptoms (2 studies, 553 participants: MD 1.00 day, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39; I² = 0%; low certainty). NSAIDs may result in a lower proportion of women experiencing microbiological resolution by day 10 compared to antibiotics (2 studies, 322 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty) and probably result in more women using rescue antibiotic treatment by day 30 (4 studies, 1165 participants: RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.42; I² = 49%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, NSAIDs may reduce the use of rescue antibiotic treatment (1 study, 183 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to adverse events at day 30. Compared to the herbal product Uva-Ursi, NSAIDs may make little or no difference to adverse events by day 30.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of NSAIDs for symptomatic management of uncomplicated UTIs probably results in less short-term resolution of symptoms and greater use of rescue antibiotics by day 30 compared to primary antibiotic treatment. Future studies should consider the various confounders such as degree of symptoms, microbiology, type and resistance patterns of bacteria involved and number of UTI episodes in the months prior to commencement of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111Zt4nH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.5.1

We suggest women with reflux nephropathy, congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT), women with CKD taking immunosuppression, and women with a history of recurrent UTI should be offered antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy after a single UTI in pregnancy, including asymptomatic bacteriuria (2D).

Guideline 5.5.2

We recommend pre-pregnancy UTI prophylaxis be continued in pregnancy using agents known to be safe (1D).

Rationale

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is estimated to occur in 2 to 7% of pregnancies with a risk of progression to acute pyelonephritis if untreated. A meta-analysis of studies to 2015 showed that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria reduced the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy from 21 to 5% (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13–0.41), with some poor quality evidence that antibiotic use also reduced the incidence of low birth weight babies and preterm delivery. Screening of all pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria is therefore recommended. There are no data describing outcomes for women with CKD and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections-United States, 2014 [^112uqGPw]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in about 8% of pregnant women, and untreated UTIs can have serious consequences, including pyelonephritis, preterm labor, low birth weight, and sepsis (1). Pregnant women are typically screened for UTIs during early pregnancy, and those with bacteriuria are treated with antibiotics (1,2). Antibiotic stewardship is critical to improving patient safety and to combating antibiotic resistance. Because of the potential risk for birth defects, including anencephaly, heart defects, and orofacial clefts, associated with use of sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin during pregnancy (3), a 2011 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed in the first trimester of pregnancy only when other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate (4). To assess the effects of these recommendations, CDC analyzed the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database* to examine antibiotic prescriptions filled by pregnant women with UTIs. Among 482,917 pregnancies in 2014, 7.2% of women had an outpatient UTI diagnosis during the 90 days before the date of last menstrual period (LMP) or during pregnancy. Among pregnant women with UTIs, the most frequently prescribed antibiotics during the first trimester were nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Given the potential risks associated with use of some of these antibiotics in early pregnancy and the potential for unrecognized pregnancy, women's health care providers should be familiar with the ACOG recommendations and consider the possibility of early pregnancy when treating women of reproductive age.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — screening and treatment recommendations: In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest a urine culture collected at one of the initial visits early in pregnancy. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks note that the optimal duration of therapy will vary depending on the antimicrobial given; the shortest effective course should be used.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1135gTkJ]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — pre-initiation step, postcoital and continuous strategies, efficacy, and duration: both the European Association of Urology and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend ensuring a negative urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics; postcoital prophylaxis should be offered to women who have UTIs temporarily related to sexual intercourse, and these women will take a single dose of an antimicrobial agent immediately after intercourse; postcoital therapy decreased recurrence rates compared with placebo (0.3 vs 3.6 patient-years, P = 0.001) and was equally as efficacious as continuous daily therapy; with continuous prophylaxis, a patient takes a single, daily antibiotic dose, and compared with placebo, continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95%; the duration of these regimens ranges from 6 months to at least 2 years, with regimens extended to 5 years in some reports; a Cochrane review in nonpregnant women found that antibiotics given continuously for 6 to 12 months were considerably more effective than placebo in preventing rUTI (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08–0.28); several studies have found that 50% to 60% of women become reinfected within 3 months of discontinuing prophylaxis; this document supports reevaluation of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis at 3 months, and antibiotic prophylaxis is rarely continued beyond 6 months, although it may have to be restarted if UTIs recur.

### Should low-risk pregnant patients be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria? [^113B37jT]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractScreening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is generally not recommended due to a lack of clinical benefit and potential harm. A notable exception is the recommendation for routine screening during pregnancy. In this Tomorrow's Trial, the authors review the relevant evidence and propose a trial to address the question, "should low-risk pregnant patients be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria?"

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^113X7c1U]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common complications of pregnancy; upper tract infections in particular may lead to significant morbidity for both the mother and fetus. Bacteriuria is a significant risk factor for developing pyelonephritis in pregnant women. Therefore, proper screening and treatment of bacteriuria during pregnancy is necessary to prevent complications. All women should be screened for bacteriuria in the first trimester, and women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections or anomalies should have repeat bacteriuria screening throughout pregnancy. Treatment of bacteriuria should include 3-day therapy with appropriate antimicrobials, and women should be followed closely after treatment because recurrence may occur in up to one third of patients.

### Development of quality indicators for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in general practice: a RAND appropriateness method [^113HPL3G]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Methods

A Research and Development (RAND)/University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) appropriateness method was used for the development of the indicators. This method was established in the 1980s by the RAND health organisationin corporation with UCLA. It is a consensus method described as the only thoroughly tested systematic method combining evidence with expert opinion. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method is widely used for the development of QIs in healthcare systems, and comprises four steps:

Development of preliminary QIs based on scientific evidence and guidelines.
First assessment of proposed QIs by a panel of experts using an emailed fact sheet (round 1).
Consensus meeting in which the panellists discuss the indicators.
Second assessment of QIs during the meeting (round 2).

Preparatory phase

A national research team comprising four researchers/physicians (including three of the authors) was established. The assignment of the research team was to generate a set of proposed QIs as well as to prepare and lead the consensus process.

The team identified all evidence-based Danish guidelines for the management of patients with suspected UTI in general practice. Only guidelines available online were included. Several main themes for quality measurement were identified from the guidelines. Whenever guidelines presented conflicting recommendations the most recent recommendation was used. The recommendations were operationalised as preliminary QIs with accompanying standards. Further evidence-based literature was sought whenever needed to complete the development of each of the preliminary QIs. This set of indicators was divided into three quality domains focusing on either; the diagnostic process (eg, the assessment of specific symptoms, signs and test results), the treatment decision (eg, to prescribe or withhold antibiotics) or the choice of antibiotics prescribed (eg, pivmecillinam, sulfamethizole, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin). The indicators comprised both lower and upper UTI for patients aged ≥ 18 years. Some QIs concerned only specific patient groups, such as catheter users and pregnant women. Each proposed QI was developed with an accompanying standard (acceptable range) to encompass the optimal performance addressed by that indicator. Standards were based on most recent national guidelines. Low quality of the care provided is indicated if a performance falls outside the standard range. Furthermore, a registration chart (online supplemental appendix 1) to collect data for quality investigation was developed to match the proposed indicators.

### Benefits and harms of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: a systematic review and meta-analysis by the European Association of Urology urological infection guidelines panel [^111iJPVR]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

People with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) are often unnecessarily treated with antibiotics risking adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. We performed a systematic review to determine any benefits and harms of treating ABU in particular patient groups. Relevant databases were searched and eligible trials were assessed for risk-of-bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Education quality. Where possible, a meta-analysis of extracted data was performed or a narrative synthesis of the evidence was presented. After screening 3626 articles, 50 studies involving 7088 patients were included. Overall, quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. There was no evidence of benefit for patients with no risk factors, patients with diabetes mellitus, postmenopausal women, elderly institutionalised patients, patients with renal transplants, or patients prior to joint replacement, and treatment was harmful for patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Treatment of ABU resulted in a lower risk of postoperative UTI after transurethral resection surgery. In pregnant women, we found evidence that treatment of ABU decreased risk of symptomatic UTI, low birthweight, and preterm delivery. ABU should be treated prior to transurethral resection surgery. In addition, current evidence also suggests that ABU treatment is required in pregnant women, although the results of a recent trial have challenged this view.

Patient Summary

We reviewed available scientific studies to see if people with bacteria in their urine but without symptoms of urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics to eliminate bacteria. For most people, treatment was not beneficial and may be harmful. Antibiotic treatment did appear to benefit women in pregnancy and those about to undergo urological surgery.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1135sj3d]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy — biological understanding and antibiotic considerations — links pregnancy-related factors to infection risk and potential benefits and harms of treatment. The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse pregnancy outcomes is related to a combination of factors, and pregnancy further increases the risk because of changes in urine pH, bladder compression, and urethral dilation; pyelonephritis in pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons could prevent cases of pyelonephritis and associated negative pregnancy outcomes. Antibiotics are the mainstay treatment for urinary tract infections, but the use of antibiotics is known to lead to antimicrobial resistance, there is emerging evidence that bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts plays a protective role, and antibiotic use can disrupt these effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115ycTny]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence and maternal–fetal outcomes: ASB occurs in 2%–7% of pregnant women. Prospective randomized studies from the 1960s to 1980s uniformly reported that antimicrobial treatment decreased the incidence of pyelonephritis from 20%–35% to 1%–4%, with some studies also reporting decreased low birth weight (< 2500 g) and premature labor. A 2015 Cochrane review included 14 RCTs and, based on 11 RCTs (1932 women), antimicrobials probably reduce the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnant women with ASB. Based on 2 RCTs, antimicrobials may reduce the risk of preterm birth (low quality), with the baseline risk of preterm birth in women with untreated ASB about 53 per 1000 and antibiotics probably lowering the chance of very low birth weight from approximately 137 per 1000 to 88 per 1000 (RD, −49 [95% CI, −75 to −10]; moderate quality). In the Netherlands, the frequency of pyelonephritis in women with untreated ASB was substantially lower (2.4%) than reported in earlier studies.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^113y76kv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the more common perinatal complications, affecting approximately 8% of pregnancies (1, 2). These infections represent a spectrum, from asymptomatic bacteriuria, to symptomatic acute cystitis, to the most serious, pyelonephritis. The presence of UTIs has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including increased rates of preterm delivery and low birth weight. Screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria have been shown in multiple studies to reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy (3–5). Given the frequency at which UTIs are encountered in pregnancy, the ability to recognize, diagnose, and treat them is essential for those providing care to pregnant individuals. This Clinical Consensus document was developed using an established protocol in conjunction with the authors listed.

### Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy [^1156yCBw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A Cochrane systematic review has shown that drug treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women substantially decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, it is not clear whether single-dose therapy is as effective as longer conventional antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different durations of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2011) and reference lists of identified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing antimicrobial therapeutic regimens that differed in duration (particularly comparing single dose with longer duration regimens) in pregnant women diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 1622 women. All were comparisons of single-dose treatment with four- to seven-day treatments. The trials were generally of limited quality. The 'no cure rate' for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women was slightly higher for the single-dose than for the short-course treatment; however, these results were not statistically significant and showed heterogeneity. When comparing the trials that used the same antibiotic in both treatment and control groups with the trials that used different antibiotics in both groups, the 'no cure rate' risk ratio was similar. There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria rate between treatment and control groups. Slight differences were detected for preterm births and pyelonephritis although, apart from one trial, the sample size of the trials was inadequate. Single-dose treatment was associated with a decrease in reports of 'any side-effects'.

Authors' Conclusions

Single-dose regimen of antibiotics may be less effective than the seven-day regimen. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated by the standard regimen of antibiotics until more data become available testing seven-day compared with three- or five-day regimens.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^114tYHuA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in pregnancy and account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. It is well known that antibiotic use is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and therefore measures to minimise antibiotic use for UTI prevention have been studied. The efficacy and safety of these measures in pregnancy have not been addressed and therefore the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify and evaluate potential measures to prevent UTIs in pregnant women.

Methods

Ten databases (EMBASE, AMED, BNI, CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Trials, Scopus and Science Direct) were systematically searched in July 2017 for studies reporting non-antibiotic measures to prevent UTIs in pregnancy. The terms ("urinary tract infection" or UTI or bacteriuria or cystitis) AND (prevention) AND (pregnan*) were used. The quality of the publications was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists for cohort study, case-control study and randomised controlled trial. The results were synthesised using a textual narrative approach.

Results

Search results yielded 3276 publications and after reviewing titles and removing duplicates, 57 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and eight were included in the review. Five different approaches (hygiene measures, cranberry juice, immunisation, ascorbic acid and Canephron® N) have been identified, all of which are reported to be safe in pregnancy.

Conclusion

The quality of the evidence varied considerably and only hygiene measures were supported by evidence to be recommended in practice. Future work needs to concentrate on strengthening the evidence base through improved design and reporting of studies with a focus on immunisation, ascorbic acid and Canephron® N.

### Pharmaceutical agents and pregnancy in urology practice [^111HMpJg]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Urologic medical conditions are not frequently encountered during pregnancy. Still, urologists often are asked to treat pregnant patients for conditions that require prescriptions. In the generally healthy population of pregnant women, the use of pharmaceutical agents is usually reserved for women who have either infections or necessary surgical procedures. This article addresses the implications for pregnancy of common urologic conditions in generally healthy pregnant women, namely simple urinary tract infections that demand nitrofurantoin and complex urinary tract infections that necessitate fluoroquinolones treatment. It also examines the implications of nonobstetric surgical intervention.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^1144U2MN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection, and occurs in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 4 November 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening. Trials using a cluster-RCT design and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross-over studies were not.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 15 studies, involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 12 studies, 2017 women; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic treatment may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; 3 studies, 327 women; low-certainty evidence), and low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; 6 studies, 1437 babies; low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; 4 studies; 596 women), but the results were inconclusive for serious adverse neonatal outcomes (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.79, 3 studies; 549 babies). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes, and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias across all domains; the other 14 studies were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. Many studies lacked an adequate description of methods, and we could only judge the risk of bias as unclear, but in most studies, we assessed at least one domain at high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the three primary outcomes with GRADE software, and found low-certainty evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment may be effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, but our confidence in the effect estimate is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. There may be a reduction in preterm birth and low birthweight with antibiotic treatment, consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but again, the confidence in the effect is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. Research implications identified in this review include the need for an up-to-date cost-effectiveness evaluation of diagnostic algorithms, and more evidence to learn whether there is a low-risk group of women who are unlikely to benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1151tNtE]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Pregnancy benefit–harm assessment for screening asymptomatic bacteriuria — There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. However, evidence shows that the incidence of pyelonephritis among pregnant women with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria has been low in recent decades, which may reduce the potential benefit from screening asymptomatic bacteriuria. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms; therefore, the USPSTF bounds the benefits of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons as no greater than moderate and bounds the overall magnitude of harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons to be at least small. The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons, although these harms are thought to be no greater than small in magnitude, and found adequate evidence on the harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment; it also considered the potential effects of changes in the microbiome resulting from antibiotic use.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^1114HNHo]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 3% of pregnant women in high-income countries, (Piccoli et al. 2018, #13860) which equates to between 15,000–20,000 pregnancies per year in England. The prevalence of CKD in pregnancy is predicted to rise in the future due to increasing maternal age and obesity.

Although CKD is not a barrier to reproduction in most women, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is increased in women with CKD including pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery and accelerated loss of maternal renal function. CKD impacts on communication, decision-making, and the surveillance and management of women before, during, and after pregnancy.

Existing guidance on the management of CKD in pregnancy includes the UK Consensus Group on Pregnancy in Renal Disease (ISBN 978–1,107,124,073) and expert review.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^1133WNzH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

A total of ten databases were searched and search terms were mutually agreed by the authors and an independent colleague to ensure a comprehensive process. The studies included in the review were assessed independently by the authors using CASP checklists. Any disagreement was resolved by meeting and discussing the relevant studies. A limitation of this review is that only English language publications were included therefore there might be options which have not been identified. The results of this review have been discussed using a narrative synthesis approach due to the heterogeneous design of the included studies and the differing nature of the interventions identified.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^113UXyyY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to UTIs because of physiological changes. The growing uterus can result in urinary retention which predisposes the woman to infection. In addition, hormonal fluctuations relax the ureteral muscle and cause accumulation of urine in the bladder which also increases the chance of developing a UTI.

Treatment of UTIs is recommended in pregnancy if bacteria are detected in the urine even if there are no accompanying symptoms i.e. in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Both ASB and symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis which can result in severe maternal morbidity. It is estimated that 20–30% of women with bacteriuria in the first trimester go on to develop pyelonephritis in later trimesters. Therefore, although ASB on its own is not treated in the general population, guidelines published by the European Urological Association (EAU) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend screening and treating bacteriuria with or without symptoms. The current management strategy according to these guidelines is to use a short course of antibiotics.

### Urinary tract infection in women [^115N3SyA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Urinary tract bacterial infections are common in women. Moreover, they tend to recur throughout life and in the same relatively small group of women. In most cases, bladder and renal infections are asymptomatic and manifest by demonstrating coincidental bacteriuria. In some instances, however, especially with frequent sexual activity, pregnancy, stone disease, or diabetes, symptomatic cystitis or pyelonephritis develops and antimicrobial therapy is indicated. In most cases, cystitis is easily managed with minimal morbidity. When acute pyelonephritis develops in an otherwise healthy woman, however, consideration for ureteral obstruction is entertained. If her clinical response to proper therapy is not optimal, then imaging studies are indicated. Pregnancy is a common cause of obstructive uropathy, and severe renal infections are relatively common. Because they usually arise from preexisting covert bacteriuria, experts recommend screening and eradication of these silent infections as a routine prenatal practice.

### Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy [^116aPaVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A previous Cochrane systematic review has shown that antibiotic drug treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women substantially decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, it is not clear whether single-dose therapy is as effective as longer conventional antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different durations of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2015) and reference lists of identified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing antimicrobial therapeutic regimens that differed in duration (particularly comparing single dose with longer duration regimens) in pregnant women diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 1622 women. All were comparisons of single-dose treatment with short-course (four- to seven-day) treatments. The risk of bias of trials included in this review was largely unclear, and most trials were at high risk of performance bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. When the any antibiotic agent was used, the 'no cure' rate for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women was slightly lower for the short-course treatment over the single-dose treatment, although there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity (average risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.88; women = 1502, studies = 13; I² = 56%; very low quality evidence). Data from only good quality trials also showed better cure rates with short (four- to seven-day) regimens of the same microbial agent (average RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.33; women = 803, studies = two; I² = 0%; high quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the recurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria rate between treatment and control groups, whether the same or different microbial agents were used (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66; 445 women studies = eight; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Differences were detected for low birthweight babies, favoring a short course (four- to seven-day treatment) of the same microbial agent, although the data come from a single trial (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.57; 714 women; high quality evidence), but no differences were observed for preterm delivery (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; women = 804; studies = three; I² = 23%; moderate quality) or pyelonephritis (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.54 to 17.55; women = 102; studies = two; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Finally, single-dose treatment of any microbial agent was associated with a decrease in reports of 'any side effects' (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 1460 women, studies = 12; I² = 9%; low quality evidence). Evidence was downgraded for risk of bias concerns in trials contributing data and for imprecise effect estimates (wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and in some cases, small studies with few events).

Authors' Conclusions

A single-dose regimen of antibiotics may be less effective than a short-course (four- to seven-day) regimen, but more evidence is needed from large trials measuring important outcomes, such as cure rate. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated by the standard regimen of antibiotics until more data become available testing seven-day treatment compared with shorter courses of three- or five-day regimens.

### The etiology and prevalence of urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women in iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116htS8]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

UTI and ASB are highly common in pregnant women in Iran and the most common type of UTI is ASB. Therefore, it is recommended that urine culture be conducted as a part of routine tests for pregnant women. Moreover, pregnant women need to be provided with complete information about UTI complications during their pregnancy. The most common microorganisms involved in the etiology of ASB and UTI in pregnant women in Iran are E.coli and Staphylococcus. Since women and mothers' health is the foundation of the family and the public health, making better management decisions for prevention, screening and treatment of this problem is recommended.

### Treatment and prevention of recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women: a rapid review with practice recommendations [^116LonYk]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women are a highly prevalent and burdensome condition for which best practice guidelines for treatment and prevention that minimize harm and optimize well-being are greatly needed. To inform development of practice recommendations, a rapid literature review of original research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and practice guidelines was conducted.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Embase®, Opus, Scopus®, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library and the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse electronic databases were searched from inception to September 22, 2017. Articles and practice guidelines were included if they were in English, were peer reviewed, included women, involved treatment or prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection and reported an outcome related to recurrence rates of urinary tract infection. Critical appraisal of original studies was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR 2 tool.

Results

Of 1,582 citations identified 74 met our study inclusion criteria. These comprised 49 randomized controlled trials, 23 systematic reviews (16 with meta-analyses) and 2 practice guidelines. No study reported a multi-targeted treatment approach. There was a lack of high quality studies and systematic reviews evaluating prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

We recommend an algorithmic approach to care that includes education on lifestyle and behavioral modifications, and addresses specific populations of women with antimicrobial based and nonantibiotic alternatives. This approach includes the use of vaginal estrogen with or without lactobacillus containing probiotics in postmenopausal women, low dose post-coital antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infection associated with sexual activity in premenopausal women, low dose daily antibiotic prophylaxis in premenopausal women with infections unrelated to sexual activity, and methenamine hippurate and/or lactobacillus containing probiotics as nonantibiotic alternatives. Future research should involve consistent use of terminology, validated instruments to assess response to interventions and patient perspectives on care. Our treatment algorithm is based on the best available evidence, and fills a gap in the literature and practice regarding effective strategies to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in women.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^113GGCdL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Wk6bV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^116uCXSG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison with previous research

Due to differing inclusion and exclusion criteria, the above-mentioned Cochrane Review included far more studies than our review (14 randomised and quasi-randomised trials). The Cochrane Review considered the primary outcomes pyelonephritis, low birth weight, and preterm birth. A meta-analysis of 11 of the 14 studies showed a statistically significant decline in pyelonephritis rates under antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment (RR [relative risk] = 0.23, 95% CI 0.13–0.41, p < 0.001).

The authors of the Cochrane Review conclude that antibiotics are effective in preventing pyelonephritis, but also state that the methodological shortcomings of the trials included affect the strength of their conclusions.

However, our review comprises results of the first trial in this field that has been conducted since the 1980s, which leads to considerable changes in the judgement of the benefits of screening and treating ASB.

Strengths and limitations (study and review level)

As we anticipated publications of varying quality and age, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study population were applied rather strictly in order to obtain sufficiently conclusive data. We placed particular emphasis on the requirement that the population should consist solely of asymptomatic women. When we could not rule out that symptomatic women were included, the study was not considered. This resulted in a study pool of only four eligible studies.

The existing evidence derived from RCTs refers only to the treatment of ASB. RCTs investigating the overarching question, that is, whether a screening programme for detection of ASB is beneficial, have still not been conducted. However, the results of the Dutch ASB cohort study show that, with access to high-quality health care and generally good maternal health status, a routine ASB screen-and-treat policy may not result in a considerable gain in health outcomes.

Eligibility criteria

Study characteristics

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If insufficient evidence was available from RCTs, we also planned to include non-randomised interventional prospective trials (referred to as controlled clinical trials: CCTs).

The eligibility criteria for the population, study and control interventions, and outcomes are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Eligibility criteria

ASB asymptomatic bacteriuria, UTI urinary tract infection

We searched for studies investigating at least one predefined patient-relevant outcome. In this context, the term 'patient-relevant' refers to how a person (in this case, a mother or child) feels, functions, or survives. In addition, we planned to analyse data on the following additional predefined non-patient-relevant outcomes if they were reported in the studies included: preterm birth > 32 − < 37 weeks of gestation, birth weight 1500 − < 2500 g, and pre-eclampsia with unknown symptom status.

Document characteristics

We included both published and unpublished studies if a full-text document (e.g. journal article or clinical study report) was available. We did not apply language or publication date restrictions. We excluded multiple publications not providing additional relevant information.

Data extraction

The individual steps of the data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by one author and checked by another; disagreements were resolved by consensus. We extracted details of the studies using standardised tables developed and routinely used by IQWiG.

We extracted information from each included study on:
Study characteristics, including study design, length of follow-up, sample size, location, and period in which the study was conducted.
Characteristics of the study participants, including age, parity, present diabetes mellitus, history of UTI, sociodemographic data, and dropout rate.
Characteristics of interventions, including treatment regimen and adjunct treatments.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria, including method of urine collection, diagnostic procedure(s), and cut-offs used to identify study participants.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy has, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to try to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. Only when cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, were there better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and less recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group, but the sample size is insufficient to ensure that differences found in the effect of the drugs were real.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific treatment regimen for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of outcomes measured. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to try to detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114noHCa]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive review of urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy. All aspects of UTIs, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, resistance, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, were reviewed.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-August 2003) and Cochrane Library searches were performed using the key search terms urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and resistance.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All article abstracts were evaluated for relevance. Only articles pertaining to pregnancy were included. The majority of published literature were review articles; the number of original clinical studies was limited.

Data Synthesis

UTIs are the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy. They are characterized by the presence of significant bacteria anywhere along the urinary tract. Pyelonephritis is the most common severe bacterial infection that can lead to perinatal and maternal complications including premature delivery, infants with low birth weight, fetal mortality, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and transient renal insufficiency. Enterobacteriaceae account for 90% of UTIs. The common antibiotics used are nitrofurantoin, cefazolin, cephalexin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin.

Conclusions

Therapeutic management of UTIs in pregnancy requires proper diagnostic workup and thorough understanding of antimicrobial agents to optimize maternal outcome, ensure safety to the fetus, and prevent complications that lead to significant morbidity and mortality in both the fetus and the mother.

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^114UacDQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria (most often Escherichia coli) from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in non-pregnant women with uncomplicated infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (intravenous), antibiotics (oral), and antibiotics (switch therapy).

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^113R6hZ5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection among pregnant women and have been associated with maternal and foetal complications. Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy is not without risk. International guidelines recommend a single screen-and-treat approach to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB); however, this approach has been questioned by recent studies.

Objectives

The aim of this narrative review was to assess the pathophysiology, current risk factors and management of UTI during pregnancy, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and to develop recommendations on the best use of antimicrobials.

Sources

PubMed, Cochrane database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Content

Owing to the physiological changes related to pregnancy, pregnant women are at higher risk of UTI. All types of UTIs combined have been estimated to affect approximately 2% to 15% of women. ASB affects 2% to 7% of pregnant women. Recent studies do not provide good-quality evidence for an association between ASB and acute pyelonephritis if ASB is untreated. There is low-to-moderate-quality evidence that treatment of ASB results in a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth, which justifies screening practices for ASB with only a single urine culture in the first trimester. If the clinician opts for treatment, a short course of β-lactams, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin should be favoured. Studies on cystitis during pregnancy are limited. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be associated with increased maternal complications and in some studies has also been associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight. Preferred antimicrobials for the management of pyelonephritis are amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Studies on recurrent UTIs during pregnancy are limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding prophylactic measures.

Implications

Further research is required to understand the true incidence of ASB-related complications and the benefit and modalities of screening for ASB and to further explore prophylactic measures.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11183VFt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections-United States, 2014 [^112UThM6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in about 8% of pregnant women, and untreated UTIs can have serious consequences, including pyelonephritis, preterm labor, low birth weight, and sepsis. Pregnant women are typically screened for UTIs during early pregnancy, and those with bacteriuria are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic stewardship is critical to improving patient safety and to combating antibiotic resistance. Because of the potential risk for birth defects, including anencephaly, heart defects, and orofacial clefts, associated with use of sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin during pregnancy, a 2011 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed in the first trimester of pregnancy only when other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. To assess the effects of these recommendations, CDC analyzed the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database * to examine antibiotic prescriptions filled by pregnant women with UTIs. Among 482,917 pregnancies in 2014, 7.2% of women had an outpatient UTI diagnosis during the 90 days before the date of last menstrual period (LMP) or during pregnancy. Among pregnant women with UTIs, the most frequently prescribed antibiotics during the first trimester were nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Given the potential risks associated with use of some of these antibiotics in early pregnancy and the potential for unrecognized pregnancy, women's health care providers should be familiar with the ACOG recommendations and consider the possibility of early pregnancy when treating women of reproductive age.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^1135Vqiz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, to screen or not to screen-and when to treat? [^111D5ira]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. The purpose of this review is to outline and evaluate the most recent literature on the management of ABU.

Recent Findings

The role of ABU management has been evaluated in several patient subgroups: healthy patients without identified risk factors, pregnant women, postmenopausal women, women with recurrent UTI, patients with diabetes, elderly institutionalized patients, patients with renal transplants, patients with indwelling catheters and prior to surgery. Available evidence only supports the need for screening and treatment of ABU in pregnant women and prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa. In all the other conditions the treatment of ABU is not only useless but also harmful. A short course treatment in pregnant women is recommended; in patients with ABU prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa the treatment should be given in line with antibiogram and in line with the recommendations of European Association of Urology guidelines.

Summary

The approach to patients with ABU has changed completely during recent years. Today, screening and treatment of ABU is recommended only in pregnant women and in all patients who are candidates for urological procedures breaching the mucosa.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^114x3fzL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Most European and North American clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) as a routine pregnancy test. Antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnant women is supposed to reduce maternal upper urinary tract infections (upper UTIs) and preterm labour. However, most studies supporting the treatment of ASB were conducted in the 1950s to 1980s. Because of subsequent changes in treatment options for ASB and UTI, the applicability of findings from these studies has come into question. Our systematic review had three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, in case no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

Methods

We systematically searched several bibliographic databases, trial registries, and other sources (up to 02/2016) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomised trials. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and assessed the risk of bias of the studies included. As meta-analyses were not possible, we summarised the results qualitatively.

Results

We did not identify any eligible studies that investigated the benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening or that compared different screening strategies. We identified four RCTs comparing antibiotics with no treatment or placebo in 454 pregnant women with ASB. The results of 2 studies published in the 1960s showed a statistically significant reduction in rates of pyelonephritis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.59) and lower UTI (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.35) in women treated with antibiotics. By contrast, event rates reported by a recent study were not statistically significantly different, neither regarding pyelonephritis (0% vs. 2.2%; OR = 0.37, CI 0.01–9.25, p = 0.515) nor regarding lower UTI during pregnancy (10% vs. 18%; Peto odds ratio [POR] = 0.53, CI 0.16–1.79, p = 0.357). Data were insufficient to determine the risk of harms. As three of the four studies were conducted several decades ago and have serious methodological shortcomings, the applicability of their findings to current health care settings is likely to be low. The recent high-quality RCT was stopped early due to a very low number of primary outcome events, a composite of preterm delivery and pyelonephritis. Therefore, the results did not show a benefit of treating ASB.

Conclusions

To date, no reliable evidence supports routine screening for ASB in pregnant women.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^113dwDbX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Interpretation of results

To date, no RCTs are available that assess the benefits and harms of screening for ASB. The available evidence is limited to four treatment trials: three with serious methodological shortcomings and questionable applicability to current medical practice and one low-risk-of-bias trial that was stopped due to a very low number of pyelonephritis events in both the treatment and control group. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn on whether the benefits of screening for ASB outweigh the potential harms. However, no reliable evidence supports routine screening for ASB in pregnant women.

Implications for future research

Due to the low number of women randomised (n = 85), the randomised part of the study by Kazemier et al. provides little additional information on the question as to whether treatment of ASB is beneficial. However, the low absolute risk of pyelonephritis in low-risk pregnancies questions current practice. Taking this low risk into account, future trials have to be planned on a larger scale to achieve sufficient statistical power to either confirm or adjust current recommendations on screening for and treatment of ASB. However, as long as there are no new studies indicating the need to screen and treat ASB in pregnancy, screening is not supported by clinical evidence.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112fFzSm]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF asymptomatic bacteriuria — pregnant persons, harms of screening and treatment: One cohort study (n = 186) comparing screened vs unscreened pregnant women reported on congenital abnormalities with no meaningful differences. Seven treatment studies reported harms; five (n = 961) reported congenital malformations, with all but one study showing fewer cases in the intervention group, although numbers were small and pooled estimates were not statistically significant. Other infant or fetal harms (jaundice, respiratory distress, neonatal sepsis) were sparsely reported with low event rates; medication adverse reactions included vaginitis and diarrhea with ampicillin, and nausea and rashes with nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin; pregnancy and delivery complications were inconsistently and sparsely reported, limiting conclusions.
