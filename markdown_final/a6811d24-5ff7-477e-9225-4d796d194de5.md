## Question

first line management for oppositional defiant disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line management for oppositional defiant disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether behavioral or pharmacologic treatments are first-line. Then, I should identify which behavioral components are most effective, including validated parent training programs. Next, I will consider developmental stage and intervention format, including family-based delivery and the importance of early intervention. After that, I need to account for common comorbidities, especially ADHD, and how that modifies management. Finally, I will plan for monitoring durability of effect and when to layer adjunctive psychosocial or pharmacologic treatments if indicated, making sure each step aligns with current evidence and guidelines [^1166LgaN] [^115W6SNJ].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle so I don't jump to conclusions: behavioral interventions are first-line for ODD, not medications, and relatively brief, structured parenting programs can produce large treatment effects in early childhood; medications are reserved for treating comorbid conditions and are not recommended as first-line for ODD itself [^1166LgaN] [^115W6SNJ].

> I need to check which components within psychosocial care drive outcomes; the comparative meta-analysis shows that interventions with a parent component — either parent-only or multicomponent — achieve the largest effects (median about a 1.2 SD reduction), whereas child-only approaches still help but are somewhat smaller in effect (about 1.0 SD), so parent-mediated strategies should anchor first-line management; wait, I initially thought child-only programs might be ineffective, but the data show they do work, just less robustly than parent-involved formats [^115pwAca].

> Next, I should review specific, evidence-based parent training programs so recommendations are actionable; let me verify that Incredible Years, Triple P, and Tuning In To Kids have consistent support across reviews and real-world settings, including feasibility and benefit in primary care delivery, which they do, with improvements in parenting strategies and reductions in disruptive behaviors demonstrated in randomized trials [^117JiyVN] [^115FuBCk].

> Hold on, I should verify the optimal intervention format and developmental targets; family-format delivery is common and effective in adolescents, but effects can wane at follow-up without continued support, reinforcing the value of early initiation of parent training because preschool-onset ODD shows longitudinal stability and preschool diagnostic validity distinguishes typical from atypical disruptive behaviors, so intervening early in a family-based frame is prudent [^111mDfrR] [^112f4hxv] [^116J4c9T].

> But wait, what if ADHD is comorbid — which is frequent and clinically consequential; I need to ensure the plan integrates ADHD best practice: treating ADHD with stimulants can reduce both ADHD and ODD symptoms when they co-occur, and AAP guidelines support combining evidence-based behavioral intervention with FDA-approved ADHD medications for school-aged youth; importantly, this complements rather than replaces parent-mediated behavioral first-line care for ODD [^111kJKKo] [^113V75nV] [^115W6SNJ].

> I will now examine what to add beyond core parent training; the ODD practice parameter recommends a multimodal plan tailored to family context, potentially adding child-focused CBT or collaborative problem solving, especially when family dysfunction or specific anger/skills deficits are prominent, but I should confirm these are adjuncts rather than substitutes for parent training, which the evidence hierarchy supports [^114VLfwb] [^116BQhUx] [^111kJKKo].

> Next, I should review how to monitor outcomes and ensure durability; effects in adolescents are large acutely but may diminish at follow-up, so booster sessions, continued practice of skills, and periodic reassessment of impairment and externalizing symptoms are warranted; let me also consider that behavioral treatments can confer a protective effect against symptom worsening in higher-risk profiles, underscoring the value of sustained engagement [^111mDfrR] [^116CL42s].

> Finalizing the synthesis, I should double-check the core message: first-line management for ODD is evidence-based parent training delivered in a family format, initiated as early as feasible; medications are not first-line for ODD itself, but if ADHD is comorbid, stimulant therapy may be added alongside behavioral strategies; longitudinal monitoring with potential boosters and targeted adjunctive psychosocial components maintains gains and addresses residual impairments [^1166LgaN] [^115W6SNJ] [^117JiyVN] [^113V75nV].

The first-line management for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) [^1166LgaN] is **parent management training (PMT)** — for example, Incredible Years or Triple P — which reduces oppositional behaviors [^115pwAca] and improves family functioning. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (**CBT**) is added for older children and adolescents [^111mDfrR] to build emotion regulation and problem-solving skills [^116t5nTv]. Medications are not first-line [^115W6SNJ]; they are reserved for severe cases or when comorbidities such as ADHD or anxiety are present. Early intervention with PMT and CBT is essential [^115pwAca] to prevent progression to conduct disorder [^113jRp2a] and other adverse outcomes.

---

## Parent management training (PMT)

PMT is the cornerstone of **ODD treatment** [^1166LgaN], teaching parents to use consistent, positive discipline and effective communication [^115pwAca], and it has large, sustained effects on oppositional behaviors and family functioning.

- **Incredible Years**: Group-based PMT [^115pwAca] with strong evidence for reducing oppositional behaviors and improving parenting [^115FuBCk].
- **Triple P (Positive Parenting Program)**: Tiered PMT [^115pwAca] with robust evidence for reducing oppositional behaviors and improving family functioning.
- **Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)**: Live coaching to improve parent-child interactions and reduce oppositional behaviors.

---

## Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT is effective for **older children and adolescents** [^111mDfrR], targeting emotion regulation, problem-solving, and social skills, and it reduces oppositional behaviors and improves functioning [^116t5nTv].

- **Anger management**: Teaches emotion regulation and coping skills [^1166LgaN].
- **Problem-solving skills training**: Builds effective problem-solving and reduces oppositional behaviors [^111mDfrR].
- **Social skills training**: Improves peer relationships and reduces oppositional behaviors [^116t5nTv].

---

## School-based interventions

School-based interventions complement PMT and CBT by providing consistent structure and support in educational settings [^1166LgaN]. Core elements include classroom-management strategies with clear rules, consistent consequences, and positive reinforcement; individualized education plans (IEPs) tailored to academic and behavioral needs; and teacher training to equip educators with effective classroom-management skills [^115oYhSW].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Medications are **not first-line** [^115W6SNJ] for ODD; they are reserved for severe cases or when comorbidities are present [^1166LgaN].

- **Stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate)**: For comorbid ADHD, reducing ADHD and ODD symptoms [^111kJKKo].
- **Atomoxetine**: For comorbid ADHD, reducing ADHD and ODD symptoms [^117N4goC].
- **Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone)**: For severe aggression or irritability, with careful monitoring for side effects.

---

## Early intervention and prevention

Early intervention with PMT and CBT is critical [^115pwAca] to prevent progression to conduct disorder [^113jRp2a] and other adverse outcomes, with key steps including **early identification** using standardized screening tools (e.g. PSC-17) to detect ODD symptoms early and **preventive interventions** [^115FuBCk] such as PMT and CBT to reduce oppositional behaviors and improve family functioning.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess progress, adjust treatment, and prevent relapse [^1166LgaN], with key elements including **regular assessments** using standardized tools to track symptoms and functioning, and **ongoing support** for families and schools to maintain gains [^111mDfrR].

---

Parent management training is the **first-line treatment** [^115pwAca] for ODD, with CBT and school-based interventions as adjuncts; medications are reserved for severe cases or comorbidities. Early intervention and regular monitoring are essential for effective management [^1166LgaN].

### Psychosocial interventions for child disruptive behaviors: A meta-analysis [^115pwAca]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Disruptive behavior disorders are among the most common child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, associated with significant impairment.

- **Objective**: Systematically review studies of psychosocial interventions for children with disruptive behavior disorders.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers assessed studies against predetermined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by one team member and reviewed by a second. We categorized interventions as having only a child component, only a parent component, or as multicomponent interventions.

- **Results**: Sixty-six studies were included. Twenty-eight met criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis. The effect size for the multicomponent interventions and interventions with only a parent component had the same estimated value, with a median of -1.2 SD reduction in outcome score (95% credible interval, -1.6 to -0.9). The estimate for interventions with only a child component was -1.0 SD (95% credible interval, -1.6 to -0.4).

- **Limitations**: Methodologic limitations of the available evidence (e.g. inconsistent or incomplete outcome reporting, inadequate blinding or allocation concealment) may compromise the strength of the evidence. Population and intervention inclusion criteria and selected outcome measures eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis may limit applicability of the results.

- **Conclusions**: The three intervention categories were more effective than the control conditions. Interventions with a parent component, either alone or in combination with other components, were likely to be more effective.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Psychosocial treatments for disruptive behavior symptoms and disorders in adolescence [^111mDfrR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) represent a common motive for referral among youths. This meta-analysis aimed at estimating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for adolescents with DBDs.

A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant systematic review of MEDLINE/PubMED/PsycINFO/Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) administering psychosocial interventions to adolescents with DBD, published before April 5, 2020. From the initial set of 6,006 records, 17 RCTs involving 18 cohorts (16 publications) were subjected to a random-effect meta-analysis, involving sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses. Primary and secondary outcomes were externalizing symptoms at RCT endpoint, i.e. standardized mean difference (SMD) and acceptability (drop-out odds ratio [OR]), respectively. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool.

A total of 17 RCTs, involving 1,954 adolescents, were included. The mean age was 14.09 years (SD = 1.33); 61% were male. The mean RCT duration was 12 weeks, with a mean follow-up of 8 months (SD = 3.98). Concern over risk of bias emerged in 12 studies, with high concern in 6. Psychosocial interventions had a large effect size at RCT endpoint (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI = -0.55 to -1.38, k = 18) and were acceptable (drop-out OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.62–2.70, k = 13). However, this beneficial effect did not persist at follow-up (SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = 0.06 to -0.78, k = 10). Family format was the most common intervention strategy.

### Common questions about oppositional defiant disorder [^115W6SNJ]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by a pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting for at least six months. Children and adolescents with ODD may have trouble controlling their temper and are often disobedient and defiant toward others.

There are no tools specifically designed for diagnosing ODD; however, multiple questionnaires can aid in diagnosis while assessing for other psychiatric conditions. ODD is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. Behavioral therapy for the child and family members improves symptoms of ODD.

Medications are not recommended as first-line treatment for ODD; however, treatment of comorbid mental health conditions with medications often improves ODD symptoms. Adults and adolescents with a history of ODD have a greater than 90% chance of being diagnosed with another mental illness in their lifetime. They are at high risk of developing social and emotional problems as adults, including suicide and substance use disorders.

Early intervention seeks to prevent the development of conduct disorder, substance abuse, and delinquency, which can cause lifelong social, occupational, and academic impairments.

### Oppositional defiant and conduct disorder: A review of the past 10 years, part I [^113jRp2a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2000). High credibility.

The objective of this paper was to review empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).

- **Method**: Selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented.

- **Results**: Evidence supports a distinction between the symptoms of ODD and many symptoms of CD, but there is controversy about whether aggressive symptoms should be considered part of ODD or CD. CD is clearly heterogeneous, but further research is needed regarding the most useful subtypes. Some progress has been made in documenting sex differences. Symptoms that are more serious, more atypical for the child's sex, or more age-atypical appear to be prognostic of serious dysfunction. Progress has been made in the methods for assessment of ODD and CD, but some critical issues, such as combined information from different informants, remain to be addressed. A proportion of children with ODD later develop CD, and a proportion of those with CD later meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. ODD and CD frequently co-occur with other psychiatric conditions.

- **Conclusions**: Although major advances in the study of the prevalence and course of ODD and CD have occurred in the past decade, some key issues remain unanswered.

### Off-label, but on-evidence? A review of the level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy [^114Nzv5e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Many advocate that off‐label drug use is only justified when supported by a high level of evidence, even in pediatrics. Our data show that including this prerequisite in treatment guidelines or reimbursement schemes will seriously jeopardize drug treatment of children, as denying off‐label drug use may be more deleterious than the potentially increased risk of ADRs and lack of efficacy. It is reassuring, though, that drugs listed on the WHO essential medicines list are more often licensed for children, and the percentage of off‐label drugs supported by low‐quality evidence only seems lower compared with all drugs in the DPF, thus better satisfying the priority healthcare needs of the global pediatric population. Yet, drugs on the WHO list are selected with due regard to evidence of efficacy and safety, leading to overall better available evidence.

At the same time, our data clearly call for action to close the identified information gaps to improve pediatric pharmacotherapy. In this evaluation, we have focused on the traditional evidence‐based medicine approach, with systematic reviews or meta‐analyses of RCTs as the highest level of evidence, to evaluate the scientific strength pertaining to off‐label prescribing. This approach has traditionally guided the development and market authorization of drugs and is still widely used to support pediatric treatment guidelines and thus rational prescribing. It is obvious that performing multiple high-quality RCTs for the more than 2,000 off‐label records we have identified would not be feasible for obvious financial, ethical, and practical reasons.

### Clearing up the smoke: Physical and mental health considerations regarding cannabis use in adolescents with cystic fibrosis [^113QwKNa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

The risk of developing substance use disorders is higher in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. Therefore, comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with cannabis use should be explored and addressed while discussing cannabis use and screening. The International Committee on Mental Health recommends annual screening of adolescents for anxiety and depression in all CF care centers globally using the 9‐question patient health questionnaire and 7‐item generalized anxiety disorder scale.

For comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, or subsyndromal symptoms like poor self‐worth or maladaptive coping, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy should be recommended. Psychopharmacological interventions can also be considered. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline, are typically used first-line for anxiety and depression in youth. When deciding whether to start a psychotropic medication in patients with CF, providers should consider the patient's clinical status, severity of symptom presentation, past experience with psychotropic medications, family history, proposed medication delivery method, and patient/family preference.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^113B8dNC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although there have been extensive reviews of the literature on the clinical treatment of individual developmental and psychiatric disorders, there is much less information on the approach to patients with combined intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) and psychiatric syndromes (PS). Despite the limited literature on combined presentations, individuals with IDD are at a disproportionately high risk of developing PS. The high level of unmet clinical needs of individuals with such comorbidities is compounded by the fragmentation of the municipal systems designated for their care, which are commonly divided into separate and nonoverlapping bureaucracies — one for developmental disability and another for behavioral health services. Since patients with dual diagnoses may have severe and persistent impairments in adaptive function, they are often heavily reliant on governmental systems of care. A glossary for definitions of this and other selected terms is provided below:

- **Glossary of Terms**:
	- This glossary includes definitions that help understand the terminology used in this study.

Lack of knowledge, experience, and insufficient clinical infrastructure for patients with multiple disabilities results in less effective services and interventions that too often fail to meet the needs of individuals with co-occurring IDD and PS. Understanding the causal origins of neuropsychiatric disorders reinforces epidemiologic evidence that comorbidity of PS occurs disproportionately among patients with IDD and that these two domains of neuropsychiatric impairment often overlap with respect to traceable molecular genetic causes.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116PXDqP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for opioid use disorder, particularly in the initial clinical assessment, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive assessment for treatment planning. The initiation of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (OUD) should not be delayed or precluded by the completion of all assessments. If not completed beforehand, assessments should be completed soon after initiating pharmacotherapy.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112TaqDX]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options when selecting treatments:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Rather than using antidepressant medication alone.
- **Cognitive therapy plus antidepressant medication**: This approach improves the likelihood of full recovery when considering combined treatment.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116XBR6j]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins. It is characterized by pervasive behavioral symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity that have been present for at least six months and adversely impact daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent, with research combining data from multiple sources and analyzed using meta-regression reporting a worldwide-pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults, and 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals and may change over the course of development; for example, hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in the DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta (ICD-11). While the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterize the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms was relaxed for adults older than 17 years, who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least six months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as six, respectively.

### The efficacy of parent training interventions for disruptive behavior disorders in treating untargeted comorbid internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents: A systematic review [^117JiyVN]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

The findings of the systematic review overall confirm the robust efficacy of the Incredible Years, Triple P, and Tuning In To Kids parent training behavior interventions in reducing externalizing behavior difficulties in children and adolescents presenting with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) or elevated behavior problem scores that are within the clinical range. Although findings for comorbid internalizing symptoms were less consistent, internalizing symptom measures were significantly reduced in the majority of the studies assessed. Therefore, parent training programs targeted at the treatment of externalizing behavior problems may also effectively address comorbid internalizing symptoms at the same time.

### An individual participant data meta-analysis: Behavioral treatments for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^116CL42s]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Behavioral interventions are well-established treatments for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, insight into moderators of treatment outcome is limited. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA), including data from randomized controlled behavioral intervention trials for individuals with ADHD under 18 years of age. The outcomes examined were symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and impairment. Moderators investigated included symptoms and impairment severity, medication use, age, IQ, sex, socioeconomic status, and single parenthood.

For raters most proximal to treatment, small- to medium-sized effects of behavioral interventions were found for symptoms of ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), ODD, CD, and impairment. Blinded outcomes were available only for small preschool subsamples with limited measures. CD symptoms and/or diagnosis moderated outcomes on ADHD, HI, ODD, and CD symptoms. Single parenthood moderated ODD outcome, and ADHD severity moderated impairment outcome. Higher baseline CD or ADHD symptoms, a CD diagnosis, and single parenthood were related to the worsening of symptoms in the untreated but not in the treated group, indicating a protective rather than an ameliorative effect of behavioral interventions for these children.

Behavioral treatments are effective for reducing ADHD symptoms, behavioral problems, and impairment as reported by raters most proximal to treatment. Those who have severe CD or ADHD symptoms, a CD diagnosis, and single parenthood show a different response pattern, with behavioral interventions offering protection against worsening symptoms in untreated comparisons.

### Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder with and without oppositional defiant disorder in 3- to 7-year-old children [^111HT2sL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant associated behavioral problems. In order to study the characteristics of ADHD with and without oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in a representative group of young children with clinical impairment in Sweden, 131 children (101 males, 30 females) with ADHD (mean age 5 years, SD 1 year 5 months; range 3 to 7 years) were clinically examined, and their parents interviewed. Independent questionnaire data were collected using the Child Behavior Checklist, ADHD Rating Scale-IV, ODD Rating Scale-IV, and Conners Hyperactivity Index. For comparison, 131 children without ADHD were matched for sex, age, marital status, and socioeconomic status (115 males, 16 females; mean age 4 years 10 months, SD 1 year 5 months; range 3 to 7 years).

Sixty percent of those with ADHD met full DSM-IV criteria for ODD. Only 10 of the 131 children with ADHD exhibited no symptoms of ODD. The rate of children meeting full diagnostic criteria for ODD was similar across all age cohorts. Males were overrepresented in ODD, as were children of divorced parents and those of mothers with low socioeconomic status. The ADHD combined subtype was a stable independent factor influencing the diagnosis of ODD, regardless of psychosocial factors. Those with ADHD and ODD consistently showed higher rates of ADHD symptoms compared to those with ADHD without ODD. The prevalent comorbidity of ADHD with ODD indicates that all children presenting with ADHD or ODD symptoms should be assessed to explore both types of problem behavior.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113V75nV]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

The 2019 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend offering parent training in behavior management and/or behavioral classroom intervention along with U.S. FDA-approved medications, preferably both, for pediatric patients aged 6–12 years (elementary and middle school-aged) diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115cKWxp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

What shall I do if a patient does not respond to psychostimulants?

Following a poor response to two psychostimulants (methylphenidate, MPH, and amphetamines, AMPH — including lisdexamfetamine, LDX), some clinicians would consider second- or third-line approved compounds, unlicensed medications for ADHD, or combinations of different agents. However, a number of factors should be assessed before switching to alternative medications or using polypharmacy. Indeed, it should be highlighted that the majority of patients with ADHD respond to one or both classes of psychostimulants when used properly.

A comparative review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that approximately 41% of children treated with immediate-release stimulants responded equally well to AMPH or MPH, 28% responded better to AMPH, 16% had a better response to MPH, and 15% did not respond to either medication. A more recent review concluded that approximately 91% of individuals with ADHD respond to either or both classes of stimulants. We note that, as RCTs often exclude participants with specific comorbidities that decrease the rate of response, the response rate in patients seen in daily clinical practice may be lower.

Therefore, before considering alternative agents and/or polypharmacy, the following should be considered:

- **Have I titrated properly?** While some patients will respond well to low or moderate doses, others will need higher ones, regardless of their age and weight. Of note, meta-analytic evidence from flexible-dose trials for both MPH and AMPH demonstrated increased efficacy and reduced li…

### Does oppositional defiant disorder have temperament and psychopathological profiles independent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^111as3Hh]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Most studies on the temperamental and behavioral/emotional characteristics of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) did not rule out the effect of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The main objective of this study was to identify the temperamental and psychopathological patterns of ODD independent of comorbid ADHD. We also aimed to compare the patterns of temperament and psychopathology between ODD with and without ADHD.

- **Method**: Parents of 2673 students, randomly selected from 19 representative schools in Seoul, Korea, completed the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV. Among 118 children and adolescents with ODD diagnosed by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV, the parents of 94 subjects (mean age, 10.4 ± 3.0 years) and the parents of a random sample of 94 age- and gender-matched non-ODD/non-ADHD children and adolescents completed the parent's version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory.

- **Results**: Subjects with ODD showed temperament and character profiles of high Novelty Seeking, low Self-directedness, and low Cooperativeness, a distinct pattern on the CBCL, and were at increased risk for anxiety and mood disorders compared to the controls after controlling for the effect of comorbid ADHD. The children and adolescents with both ODD and ADHD showed decreased levels of Persistence and Self-directedness and higher scores on 4 subscales of the CBCL (Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behaviors, and Aggressive Behaviors) compared to those without the disorders.

### Are oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms normative behaviors in preschoolers? A comparison of referred and nonreferred children [^116J4c9T]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The authors' goal was to test the hypothesis that DSM-IV symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder can be validly applied to preschoolers.

- **Method**: Using a semistructured diagnostic interview, they assessed rates of symptoms of DSM-IV oppositional defiant and conduct disorders in 2.5–5.5-year-old children who were referred to a psychiatry clinic and a comparison group of nonreferred children.

- **Results**: Clinically referred preschool children had significantly higher rates of oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms than nonreferred children. Among nonreferred preschoolers, rates of all oppositional defiant and conduct disorder symptoms were at or below 8%.

- **Conclusions**: DSM-IV symptoms of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders distinguish referred from nonreferred preschool children in a pattern consistent with that seen in older children. Preschool children who are not seeking mental health services do not have high rates of disruptive behavior problems. The DSM-IV nosology appears to be a valid diagnostic system for discriminating between typical and atypical disruptive behaviors in preschool children.

### Clinical recommendations in current practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults [^113ABjvw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, with approximately two thirds of patients experiencing impairment into adulthood. While some adults with ADHD were diagnosed as children, many receive their diagnosis during adulthood. This presents particular challenges due to the limited familiarity with ADHD in many adult mental health services. Consequently, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD.

This article reviews these guidelines to examine best practices in adult ADHD. There is considerable consensus among these guidelines, which are essential in transitioning from emerging knowledge to patient care. However, both empirical evaluation and regular updates in response to new knowledge will be crucial for their future development.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^115HniC7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Experts in the fields of ADHD and ASD convened in December 2017 in London, UK, for a meeting hosted by the United Kingdom ADHD Partnership (UKAP). The attendees represented a multidisciplinary group of prescribing and non-prescribing clinical and academic experts with extensive experience working with individuals with ADHD and ASD, covering the fields of psychiatry, paediatrics, general practice, clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, psychotherapy, and clinical academic research. There was also representation from the field of education.

The meeting included presentations summarizing research on the topic. Following the presentations, attendees separated into three sub-groups. Each group was tasked to produce a framework of guidance with specific regard to:

- **Identification and assessment**: of children and adults with both ADHD and ASD.
- **Interventions and treatments**: for children with both ADHD and ASD.
- **Interventions and treatments**: for adults with both ADHD and ASD.

The discussions during the breakout sessions were facilitated by group leaders and summarized by note-takers. The methodological orientation that underpinned the focus of the discussion groups was phenomenological, drawing on the empirical research base and their clinical experience. The sub-group leaders then presented their conclusions to all the meeting attendees for another round of discussion and debate until consensus was agreed upon.

The entire meeting was audio recorded and later transcribed, with sub-group discussions recorded by note-takers.

### Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder: A review of the past 10 years, part II [^113a5rob]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to examine empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).

- **Method**: Selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented.

- **Results**: Research on ODD and CD during the past decade has addressed the complexity involved in identifying the primary risk factors and developmental pathways to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). In some domains, research is entering an entirely new phase because of the availability of new technologies. In others, larger data sets and more complicated methodological and statistical techniques are testing increasingly complex models. Yet questions remain regarding the most useful subtyping systems, the identification of the most significant risk factors, and the relationships between risk factors from multiple domains.

- **Conclusions**: Convincing evidence of causal linkages remains elusive. Research has questioned the notion that CD is intractable, especially when multiple domains of risk and impairment are the targets of intervention. It is apparent that there is not one single causative factor; thus it is not likely that one single modality will suffice to treat CD. Future steps will involve the restructuring of diagnostic criteria to capture adequate subtypes and indicators, clarification of the neurological underpinnings of the disorder, and refinement in the models available to explain the varied pathways to DBD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^111orm8m]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specifically in terms of pharmacotherapy indications, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend offering U.S. FDA-approved medications along with parent training in behavior management and/or behavioral classroom intervention, preferably both, for pediatric patients aged 6–12 years (elementary and middle school-aged) with ADHD.

### Disentangling heterogeneity of childhood disruptive behavior problems into dimensions and subgroups [^1146jH2E]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable and oppositional behaviors are increasingly considered as distinct dimensions of oppositional defiant disorder. However, few studies have explored this multidimensionality across the broader spectrum of disruptive behavior problems (DBPs). This study examined the presence of dimensions and distinct subgroups of childhood DBPs, and the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between these dimensions.

- **Method**: Using factor mixture models (FMMs), the presence of dimensions and subgroups of DBPs was assessed in the Generation R Study at ages 6 (n = 6,209) and 10 (n = 4,724) years. Replications were performed in two population-based cohorts (Netherlands Twin Registry, n = 4,402, and Swedish Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development, n = 1,089) and a clinical sample (n = 1,933). We used cross-lagged modeling in the Generation R Study to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between dimensions. DBPs were assessed using mother-reported responses to the Child Behavior Checklist.

- **Results**: Empirically obtained dimensions of DBPs were oppositional behavior (age 6 years), disobedient behavior, rule-breaking behavior (age 10 years), physical aggression, and irritability (both ages). FMMs suggested that one-class solutions had the best model fit for all dimensions in all three population-based cohorts. Similar results were obtained in the clinical sample. All three dimensions, including irritability, predicted subsequent physical aggression (range, 0.08–0.16).

- **Conclusion**: This study showed that childhood DBPs should be regarded as a multidimensional construct with distinct dimensions and subgroups.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^113QDKAZ]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD is common, and the presence of both conditions exacerbates difficulties beyond those experienced by either condition alone. The identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD are complex due to shared aetiologies, overlapping symptoms, and shared characteristics.

The intervention and management of both conditions are complicated by the core features of both disorders and by co-occurring neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions. These may significantly impact the engagement, effectiveness, and outcomes of both pharmacological and psychological interventions. Neurodevelopmental conditions are often missed in children and adults, especially when they present with high rates of comorbidity that healthcare practitioners are more readily able to recognize, such as anxiety and depression.

This challenge is further complicated by changes in symptom presentation as young people grow up, with a reported decline in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in ADHD and improved social communication in ASD. These "improvements", however, may be offset by the development of additional mental health problems and associated impairments that persist into adulthood.

Hence, the UKAP hosted a meeting of experts in ADHD and ASD from various disciplines to reach a consensus regarding the most appropriate methods of identifying and assessing co-occurring ADHD and ASD. We further sought to agree on the most effective interventions and treatments for ADHD and ASD in children and adults. The consensus recommendations for practice are summarized in Tables 1 and 4.

### The efficacy of parent training interventions for disruptive behavior disorders in treating untargeted comorbid internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents: A systematic review [^113N2MXf]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs) are among the most frequent reasons for child and adolescent referrals to mental health services. DBDs often develop in childhood or adolescence and have been linked to high rates of criminality and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, as well as to poor outcomes in terms of employment and social relations.

Research indicates a high incidence of internalizing problems in those with DBDs, estimated at around 20%. Those with DBDs and co-occurring internalizing problems may have more severe later outcomes. Conversely, it is possible for anxiety disorders to be a protective factor for young people with DBDs, and individual patient meta-analyses suggest that co-occurring emotional problems do not attenuate the impact of group parenting programs for DBDs.

While there is excellent evidence demonstrating the efficacy of behavioral parenting interventions for DBDs, little guidance exists to suggest the optimal treatment for children with DBDs and co-occurring internalizing disorders. Previous evidence suggests that treating co-occurring anxiety disorders with cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety is effective in reducing symptoms of DBDs. However, it remains unknown whether treatment for behavioral disorders is entirely effective in these cases.

### Do some children diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder develop querulous disorder [^111NGhJM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The outcome of children diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) has yet to be clearly established. Oppositional disorder (OD) first appeared in DSM III (1980), and then ODD replaced it in the DSM III-R (1987). At the time of this writing, there were no published articles in the literature on children followed into adulthood who were previously diagnosed with either OD or ODD. Might at least some children with ODD develop a personality disorder in the transition to adulthood? The entire cluster of ODD symptoms is not contained in a solitary personality disorder in the DSM IV-TR or International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10). A personality disorder from pre-DSM and pre-ICD personality nosology that had symptoms meeting ODD diagnostic criteria was found. This personality disorder clearly appeared to be more severe than ODD. Ongoing misperceptions and an uncompromising, argumentative stance are the most prominent characteristics of this more severe disorder. Full DSM-style diagnostic criteria are proposed for it. These can be tested to determine this disorder's validity. However, further research is needed.

### Increasing effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for conduct problems in children and adolescents: What can we learn from neuroimaging studies [^116t5nTv]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

Most psychological interventions for conduct problems that have been proven to be effective are based on operant learning principles, such as positive reinforcement, and cognitive learning principles, such as the use of inner speech. In behavioral parent training, children and adolescents acquire appropriate behaviors and learn to refrain from inappropriate behaviors as a result of parents or caregivers giving positive instructions, praising appropriate behaviors, ignoring minor inappropriate behaviors, and using time-out for severe inappropriate behaviors. Likewise, in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), children and adolescents acquire anger management and problem-solving abilities. The effectiveness of these social-learning-based behavioral therapies may depend on children's and adolescents' impairments in processing of punishment cues, reward cues, and cognitive control.

In the present review, we will focus on conduct problems in the clinical range, either because children and adolescents meet the criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) or Conduct Disorder (CD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association), Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct-Dissocial Disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases (eleventh edition; ICD-11, World Health Association), or because they show symptoms in the clinical range on a standardized measure of psychopathology. Finding ways to improve the effectiveness of psychological treatment of conduct problems remains crucial.

### The preschool attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treatment study (PATS) 6-year follow-up [^11155ijV]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to describe the clinical course of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity and diagnosis from ages 3 to 5 up to 9 to 12 years during a 6-year follow-up after the original Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS).

- **Method**: A total of 207 participants (75% male) from the original PATS were assessed at baseline (mean age of 4.4 years when all met criteria for ADHD) and 3 months later (before medication treatment). They were re-evaluated in three follow-up assessment visits: year 3 (mean age 7.4 years), year 4 (mean age 8.3 years), and year 6 (mean age 10.4 years). Parents and teachers rated symptom severity, and clinicians established psychiatric diagnoses. The analyses examined longitudinal changes in symptom severity and ADHD diagnosis.

- **Results**: Parent- and teacher-rated symptom severity decreased from baseline to year 3 but remained relatively stable and within the moderate-to-severe clinical range through year 6. Girls showed generally steeper decreases in symptom T-scores. At year 6, 89% (160 out of 180) of remaining participants met ADHD symptom and impairment diagnostic criteria. The comorbidity of oppositional defiant disorder and/or conduct disorder was associated with a 30% higher risk of having an ADHD diagnosis at year 6 in the multiple logistic model. Medication status during follow-up, whether on or off, did not predict symptom severity change from year 3 to year 6 after adjusting for other variables.

- **Conclusions**: ADHD in preschoolers is a relatively stable diagnosis over a 6-year period. The course is generally chronic, with high symptom severity and impairment, in very young children.

### Maternal ratings of ODD symptoms: Subtypes versus severity in a general community sample of children [^116NBQhE]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a common childhood disorder [American Psychiatric Association (APA), 2000; APA, 2013]. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the optimal structure for the ODD symptoms by identifying whether ODD is a qualitatively distinct entity (categorical) or is a continuum, with high levels on this continuum reflecting ODD (quantitative or dimensional view).

- **Methods**: Mothers' ratings of the ODD symptoms of 457 children, aged 3 to 15 years, as presented in the disruptive behavior rating scale, were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), latent class analysis (LCA), and factor mixture modelling (FMM) were applied to determine the best model for ODD symptoms in children.

- **Results**: The findings provided most support for an FMM with 3 classes (unaffected class, at-risk class, and affected class) and 3 factors (oppositional, antagonistic, and negative affect).

- **Conclusion**: The findings are discussed in relation to dimensional, categorical, and hybrid (categorical/dimensional) models of ODD symptoms.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^111mRjyr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental illness that can have devastating long-term consequences if untreated. Studies have shown that untreated individuals have worse outcomes than treated patients in academic, occupational, and social functioning; antisocial behavior; driving; substance use; and use of services. Family functioning is also highly affected by the child's ADHD and should be addressed by physicians. Recognition and management of ADHD in children is important so that their long-term outcomes can be improved. Differential diagnosis should include the possibility of comorbid psychiatric disorders and other developmental disorders. Neuropsychological testing may be valuable for both diagnosis and the assessment of treatment response.

### Improving parenting skills for families of young children in pediatric settings: A randomized clinical trial [^115FuBCk]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). High credibility.

Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, are common and stable throughout childhood. These disorders cause long-term morbidity but benefit from early intervention. While symptoms are often evident before preschool, few children receive appropriate treatment during this period. Group parent training, such as the Incredible Years program, has been shown to be effective in improving parenting strategies and reducing children's disruptive behaviors. Because they already monitor young children's behavior and development, primary care pediatricians are in a good position to intervene early when indicated.

- **Objective**: To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of parent-training groups delivered to parents of toddlers in pediatric primary care settings.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 11 diverse pediatric practices in the Greater Boston area. A total of 273 parents of children between 2 and 4 years old who acknowledged disruptive behaviors on a 20-item checklist were included.

- **Intervention**: A 10-week Incredible Years parent-training group co-led by a research clinician and a pediatric staff member.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Self-reports and structured videotaped observations of parent and child behaviors conducted prior to, immediately after, and 12 months after the intervention.

Results indicated that 150 parents were randomly assigned to the intervention or the waiting-list group. An additional 123 parents were assigned to receive in…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to screening for comorbid conditions, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend assessing for other conditions that might coexist with ADHD, including:

- **Emotional or behavioral conditions**: Anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use.
- **Developmental conditions**: Learning and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders.
- **Physical conditions**: Tics, sleep apnea.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112d9G7J]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, and more specifically with respect to initial therapy, the APA 2019 guidelines indicate there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against certain therapies in adult patients with depression:

- **Cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy**: There is not enough evidence to make a recommendation.

- **Brief problem-solving therapy (≤ 10 sessions) versus usual treatment**: Similarly, evidence is lacking for a definitive recommendation.

### Dimensions of oppositionality in a Brazilian community sample: Testing the DSM-5 proposal and etiological links [^1135K1oZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Investigating dimensions of oppositional symptoms may help to explain the heterogeneity of etiology and outcomes for mental disorders across development. This could provide further empirical justification for the DSM-5-proposed modifications of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). However, dimensions of oppositionality have not previously been tested in samples outside Europe or the United States. In this study, a large Brazilian community sample was used to compare the fit of different models for dimensions of oppositional symptoms, examine the association of psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms with dimensions of oppositionality, and explore the associations between dimensions of oppositionality and parental history of mental disorders.

A Brazilian community sample of 2,512 children, aged 6 through 12 years, was investigated. Confirmatory factorial analyses were performed to compare the fit of alternative models, followed by linear and logistic regression analyses of associations with psychiatric diagnosis and parental history of psychopathology.

- **Results**: A three-factor model with irritable, headstrong, and hurtful dimensions fitted best. The irritable dimension showed a strong association with emotional disorders in the child (p < 0.001), and a history of depression (p < 0.01) and suicidality (p < 0.05) in the mother. The headstrong dimension was uniquely associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the child (p < 0.001) and with maternal history of ADHD symptoms (p < 0.05). The hurtful dimension was specifically associated with conduct-related issues.

### Oppositional defiant disorder with onset in preschool years: Longitudinal stability and pathways to other disorders [^112f4hxv]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine the stability and change in oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) onset among preschool children within a pediatric sample.

A total of 510 children aged 2–5 years were initially enrolled in 1989–1990, with a mean age of 3.42 years. Out of these, 280 participated in five waves of data collection over a period ranging from 48 to 72 months, with the mean age at wave 5 being 8.35 years. Test batteries, which varied by age, comprised the Child Behavior Checklist, developmental evaluation, Rochester Adaptive Behavior Inventory, and a play session for children under 7. A structured interview, the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents, parent and child versions, was used at ages 7 and above. Consensus diagnoses were assigned using best-estimate procedures.

The results showed that wave 1 single-diagnosis ODD had a significant relationship with both single-diagnosis ODD and single-diagnosis attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in subsequent waves, but not with single-diagnosis anxiety or mood disorders. Furthermore, single-diagnosis ODD at wave 1 was linked to later comorbidity with ODD/ADHD, ODD/anxiety, and ODD/mood disorders. Stability across waves 2 through 5 was moderate to high for comorbid ODD/anxiety and ODD/ADHD; low to moderate for single-diagnosis ODD and single-diagnosis mood disorder; and low for mood disorder, single-diagnosis ADHD, and single-diagnosis anxiety disorder.

In conclusion, preschool children diagnosed with ODD are likely to continue exhibiting the disorder, with an increasing likelihood of comorbidity with ADHD, anxiety, or mood disorders.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^111u7xzL]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Many young people and adults struggle with daily demands which challenge their executive functioning, leading to difficulties with punctuality, time management, organising and prioritising work, managing their workload, and meeting deadlines. Helpful supports at work include mentoring, pairing with a more experienced 'buddy' peer, supportive monitoring, and adopting technological aids such as apps and generic software applications. To avoid confusion and/or misguided task prioritisation, it is recommended that expectations and information are explicitly communicated to the employee, both verbally and in writing.

Many occupations involve an interpersonal aspect (e.g. dealing with the public, team working with colleagues, attending meetings, giving presentations, appreciation of and adherence to line-management systems). Individuals with ADHD and ASD may struggle to manage workplace relationships, especially those who actively avoid social communication; lack an appreciation of 'office politics', occupational expectations, and boundaries (which are often not explicit); and/or do not fully understand the need to adhere to established hierarchies. They may become very anxious, irritable, and in some cases, aroused and confrontational. They may need help to resolve differences with colleagues before they escalate to more formal disputes. Workplace disputes (both performance-related and interpersonal-related) may be avoided by coaching to understand (1) the organisational structure of the work setting and (2) the expectations of how to dress and behave at work and how this differs from other contexts.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^115LysWC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Our review identified a number of recent translational advances in the management of specific psychiatric syndromes in individuals with autism — fewer in those with intellectual disability — and very few scientific articles in which comprehensive approaches to symptom identification/interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment of specific combinations of intellectual/developmental disability (IDD) and psychiatric syndromes (PS) were implemented and evaluated. The evidence base summarized here emphasizes the importance of tailoring the management of psychiatric syndromes to the unique context of a given intellectual or developmental disability, considering the widely varying consequences of such conditions on capacity for communication and engagement in intervention, the function of behavioral impairment, and the manner in which psychiatric symptoms manifest.

Table 2 provides a listing of selected clinical trials and systematic reviews, published over the past five years, documenting evidence for specific intervention modalities for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/IDD and aggression, depression, or addictions. Symptom identification must include careful consideration of precipitating factors for psychiatric symptoms that are accentuated in the context of developmental disability and the increased vulnerability to and impact of trauma. Factors that may be less easily communicated by IDD populations must be considered in diagnostic formulation, including traumatic experiences that may be viewed by the community as relatively trivial, medical conditions that incur pain, and the recognition of differences between individuals with IDD and their peers.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^112bdB5M]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Identification and assessment**: A summary of the consensus reached regarding the identification and assessment of ADHD and ASD, particularly when presenting as a comorbid diagnosis, is outlined below. When conducting an assessment for either disorder, or when considering the possibility of both co-occurring, it is essential to apply a multifaceted assessment approach. This may include the use of standardized and semi-standardized measures. As ADHD and ASD are complex neurodevelopmental conditions, a comprehensive assessment should include:

	- Background information (including developmental, clinical, and family history, and a mental state examination)
	- Rating scales
	- A clinical diagnostic interview (including a detailed assessment of symptoms, examples of impairment, and, if required, a risk assessment)
	- Observational data
	- An assessment of intellectual ability.

	- Collectively, the information gained from this approach will guide the diagnostic decision. No single point of evaluation or instrument should be conclusive in making a diagnostic decision. The high rate of co-occurrence between ADHD and ASD indicates that both conditions should be considered when one is present. ASD may confer a greater risk for co-existing ADHD, where the prevalence of the dual diagnoses appears to be somewhat higher. Indeed, young children presenting with an initial diagnosis of ASD should be continually monitored through development for ADHD, particularly.

### A process for developing community consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^117Je7fz]. Pediatrics (2005).

There remain large discrepancies between pediatricians' practice patterns and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the assessment and treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several studies raise additional concerns about access to ADHD treatment for girls, Black individuals, and those from poorer socio-economic backgrounds. Barriers may occur at multiple levels, including identification and referral by school personnel, parents' help-seeking behavior, diagnosis by the medical provider, treatment decisions, and acceptance of treatment. Such findings confirm the importance of establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that children of both genders and all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups receive appropriate assessment and treatment.

Publication of the AAP ADHD toolkit provides resources to assist with implementing the ADHD guidelines in clinical practice. These resources address a number of barriers to office implementation, including unfamiliarity with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, difficulty identifying comorbidities, and inadequate knowledge of effective coding practices.

Also crucial to the success of improved processes within clinical practice is community collaboration in care, particularly collaboration with the educational system. Such collaboration addresses other barriers to good care, such as pressures from parents and schools to prescribe stimulants, cultural biases that may prevent schools from assessing children for ADHD, or may prevent families from seeking health care, and inconsistencies in recognition of ADHD symptoms.

Regarding specific circumstances for autism spectrum disorder, particularly with respect to patients with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, the BAP 2018 guidelines recommend initiating methylphenidate as first-line therapy. Atomoxetine or an α-2A receptor agonist is suggested as second-line therapy in pediatric patients. It is essential to recognize that pediatric patients with ASD may experience more side effects and show less response than non-ASD patients with ADHD.

### Is the right research being done to guide the development of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's practice parameters [^111s1Tkh]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed Practice Parameters (PPs) to provide recommendations regarding the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with mental health disorders. Each recommendation comes with a rating, based on the level of evidence.

In descending order, recommendations are rated as a clinical standard (CS), clinical guideline, or clinical option (CO), as well as recommendations that are "not endorsed" due to ineffectiveness or contraindication. According to the PPs, a recommendation is rated as a CS if it is supported by "rigorous empirical evidence and/or overwhelming clinical consensus", whereas the lower quality recommendations, rated as COs, are founded on "emerging empirical evidence (e.g. uncontrolled trials or case series/reports) or clinical opinion but lack strong evidence and/or strong clinical consensus".

Based on the definition, clinicians may be perpetuating practices that are based on as little as expert opinion. We are aware that AACAP is in the process of transitioning from PPs to Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), which will embody a systematic approach to reconcile recommendations with national guidelines. In accordance with these higher standards, we believe that our evaluation of the research gaps will elucidate the need to encourage resource allocation in deficient areas.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^1151XNdN]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Comorbidity is very common in both conditions, but for those in whom it co-occurs, this may be considerably more marked. Research from a community sample by Simonoff and colleagues found that when ASD was comorbid with ADHD, the risk of receiving a further comorbid diagnosis increased by 14%, from 70% for the ASD group to 84% for the co-occurrence of ASD and ADHD. A prison study of 390 male inmates with ADHD reported that 21.9% screened positive for ASD, and this group with co-occurring ADHD and ASD was at higher risk of developing comorbid psychiatric symptoms than inmates in either group alone.

Thus, the co-occurrence of both conditions may increase the risk of developing further psychiatric conditions; indeed, persisting states of anxiety and dysphoria are common in ASD (alone or with comorbid ADHD), and the risk of suicide in this group is a concern. However, many individuals do not progress to a level of emotional 'disorder' that persists for a substantial period but instead experience mood instability, characterized by extreme fluctuations in mood that change rapidly over the course of a day. This may be perceived by healthcare practitioners as less debilitating and of lower concern, but for the individual (and their families/carers), these extreme fluctuating emotional states are exhausting and deeply distressing.

There are diagnostic challenges for both conditions, especially for those with subtle or 'mild' presentations, when difficulties are 'masked' by other comorbid conditions, 'camouflaged' by compensatory strategies, and/or when there is limited information available.

### Oppositional defiant disorder [^1166LgaN]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by an ongoing pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. The onset typically occurs before 8 years of age, although ODD can be diagnosed in both children and adults. This disorder is associated with a substantial social and economic burden, and childhood ODD is one of the most common precursors of other mental health problems that can arise across the lifespan. The population prevalence of ODD is approximately 3 to 5%, with a higher prevalence in males than females, particularly before adolescence.

No single risk factor accounts for ODD. The development of this disorder seems to result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and mechanisms embedded in social relationships are understood to contribute to its maintenance. The treatment of ODD is often successful, and relatively brief parenting interventions can produce large-sized treatment effects in early childhood. Therefore, ODD represents an important focus for research, practice, and policy concerning early intervention and prevention in mental health.

### Sarcosine treatment for oppositional defiant disorder symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder children [^111wmg6c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate, a stimulant that activates dopaminergic and noradrenergic function, is an important agent in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sarcosine, a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, may also play a role in treating ADHD by modulating the glutamatergic neurotransmission system through activating N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptors. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of sarcosine in treating children with ADHD.

We conducted a six-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The primary outcome measures were those on the Inattention, Hyperactivity/impulsivity, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) subscales of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV scale. Efficacy and safety were measured bi-weekly. A total of 116 children with ADHD were enrolled. Among them, 48 (83%) of the 58 sarcosine recipients and 44 (76%) of the 58 placebo recipients returned for the first post-treatment visit. The missing data values were imputed by the last observation carry forward method.

From a multiple linear regression analysis, using the generalized estimating equation approach, and an intention-to-treat analysis, the efficacy of sarcosine marginally surpassed that of placebo at weeks 2, 4, and 6, with p-values = 0.01, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively, although only for ODD symptoms. Treatment of ADHD by sarcosine (0.03 g/kg/day) was well tolerated. Sarcosine could possibly be a novel agent for managing ODD symptoms in the context of ADHD. However, future larger-scale studies are warranted to optimize its dosage.

### Altered brain morphology in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with and without comorbid conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder [^1125RvLV]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

One of the most commonly diagnosed childhood psychiatric disorders, affecting 3–9% of children and adolescents, is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is defined by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. It is related to academic and work-related difficulties and represents a major public health burden.

Around 48–67% of ADHD patients suffer from comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD). ODD is defined by developmentally inappropriate, negativistic, defiant, and disobedient behavior and is often a precursor for the more severe CD. CD is characterized by aggression, deceitfulness, property destruction, and rules violation. Compared with patients with pure ADHD, those with ADHD and comorbid ODD/CD show an earlier age of onset for ADHD symptoms and have a worse prognosis.

### Parent training for preschool ADHD in routine, specialist care: A randomized controlled trial [^114ZYBtp]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Parent training is recommended for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in preschool children. Evidence-based interventions are crucial as they must produce better outcomes than usual care to be considered effective.

The authors conducted a multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in routine specialist ADHD clinics within the Danish Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The study involved children (N = 164, aged 3–7 years) diagnosed with ADHD, who received either a well-established parent training program (New Forest Parenting Programme; n = 88) or treatment as usual (n = 76). The primary outcome measured was parent ratings of child ADHD symptoms. Secondary outcomes included teacher ratings and direct observations of ADHD symptoms. These outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 36-week follow-up. The representativeness of participants was compared to the total national cohort of children (N = 1,378, aged 3–7 years) diagnosed with ADHD during the same period, using data from the Danish Civil Registration System. The statistical analysis applied a repeated measure model.

Results indicated that after treatment, the parent training program demonstrated superiority over treatment as usual on parent-rated ADHD symptoms (p = .009; effect size d = 0.30) as well as on parenting self-efficacy and family strain. These effects persisted 36 weeks post-treatment. However, there were no noted effects on teacher ratings or direct observations of ADHD, nor on ratings of conduct problems or parenting. The clinical sample was comparable to the national cohort of young children with ADHD.

### Psychiatric comorbidity, family dysfunction, and social impairment in referred youth with oppositional defiant disorder [^116BQhUx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The authors sought to achieve an improved understanding of the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder independent of its association with conduct disorder.

- **Method**: Family interactions, social functioning, and psychiatric comorbidity were compared in clinically referred male and female subjects with oppositional defiant disorder alone (N = 643) or with comorbid conduct disorder (N = 262) and a psychiatric comparison group with neither oppositional defiant disorder nor conduct disorder (N = 695).

- **Results**: Oppositional defiant disorder youth with or without conduct disorder were found to have significantly higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders and significantly greater family and social dysfunction relative to psychiatric comparison subjects. Differences between subjects with oppositional defiant disorder alone and those with comorbid conduct disorder were seen primarily in rates of mood disorders and social impairment. Oppositional defiant disorder was a significant correlate of adverse family and social outcomes when comorbid disorders (including conduct disorder) were controlled.

- **Conclusions**: These results support the validity of the oppositional defiant disorder diagnosis as a meaningful clinical entity independent of conduct disorder and highlight the extremely detrimental effects of oppositional defiant disorder on multiple domains of functioning in children and adolescents.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^111gp1q7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Objective assessments range from direct observation of an individual in a specific setting (e.g. in clinic, at home, or at school), which provides qualitative information about the individual's behavior, to standardized assessments that compare an individual's behavior or performance against norms obtained from general and/or other specific populations. The assessor should be mindful of caveats that may influence outcomes. For example, if the individual is in a novel environment and/or aware of being observed, he may appear more socially able than usual due to 'surface skills' that he is able to apply and manage for a short period of time. In particular, the use of compensatory strategies may minimize deficits in social communication and interaction.

With respect to more formal testing, problems with mobility may limit performance, and/or the individual may perform relatively well on novel tasks, especially when these are delivered via a mode of interest (e.g. computerized tests). Moreover, a test environment is often arranged to be one that optimizes performance (i.e. it is conducted in a quiet room that minimizes distraction by an assessor who provides individual attention to ensure the person understands the test instructions and who provides prompts, encouragement, and feedback). Hence, outcomes may lack ecological validity as they may not reflect performance in the 'real world'.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116jLWLf]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, particularly in relation to behavioral therapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend offering evidence-based parent training in behavior management and/or behavioral classroom interventions as first-line therapy, if available, for pediatric patients aged 4–6 years (preschool-aged) with ADHD.

### The efficacy of parent training interventions for disruptive behavior disorders in treating untargeted comorbid internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents: A systematic review [^115DAF4Q]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) are among the primary reasons for child and youth referrals to mental health services and are linked to poor adult outcomes, including antisocial behavior disorder. Research indicates a high incidence of internalizing problems in those with DBDs, and individuals with DBDs and co-occurring internalizing problems may experience more severe outcomes later in life. Interventions targeted at internalizing symptoms have been found to also reduce comorbid externalizing problems. However, the impact of treatments for DBDs on comorbid internalizing disorders is not known.

Databases PsycINFO, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were systematically searched based on the Cochrane guidelines for systematic reviews. Records were independently reviewed by two reviewers, and 12 papers were deemed eligible. A quality assessment of the selected studies was conducted independently by both reviewers.

The 12 studies included 1,334 young people with a mean age of 5 years. The parent training interventions assessed were the Incredible Years (6 out of 12 studies), Triple-P (5 out of 12), and Tuning In To Kids (1 out of 12). Eleven of the 12 studies reported significant reductions in primary externalizing behavior problems and DBDs. Additionally, 7 studies reported significant reductions in internalizing symptoms.

Mechanisms of change, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed.

### Use of practice guidelines in the primary care of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^112Mfcxu]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Several guidelines have been published for the care of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, few data describe the adoption of practice guidelines. Our study aimed to: 1) describe primary care diagnosis and management of ADHD, 2) determine whether the care aligns with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) practice guidelines, and 3) identify factors associated with guideline adherence.

- **Methods**: We conducted a mail survey of 1,374 primary care physicians in Michigan. Main outcome measures included reported adherence to practices specified in the AAP guidelines, ADHD practice patterns, and other measures, such as attitudes about parent, teacher, and community influences on ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess patient and physician factors associated with adherence to guideline components.

- **Results**: The overall response rate was 60%. The majority (77.4%) of primary care physicians were familiar with AAP guidelines on ADHD, and many (61.1%) reported incorporating the guidelines into their practice. Differences were apparent by specialty: 91.5% of pediatricians were familiar with the guidelines in contrast to 59.8% of family physicians. The majority of clinicians reported practices consistent with individual components of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines. However, when adherence to multiple components was analyzed together, only 25.8% of clinicians reported routine use of all four diagnostic components in the survey. In addition, some physicians continue to use diagnostic practices outside the guidelines.

### Atomoxetine for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder [^117N4goC]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

In this study, we examined the effectiveness of atomoxetine for the treatment of oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

- **Methods**: Patients were aged 6 to 12 years and met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. They had a Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subscale score above age and gender norms, a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale score of ≥ 4, and a Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised oppositional defiant disorder subscale score of ≥ 15. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1.2 mg/kg per day of atomoxetine (n = 156) or placebo (n = 70) for 8 weeks. Treatment effect on oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms was measured using the investigator-rated Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised.

- **Results**: Repeated-measures analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference favoring atomoxetine over placebo in reducing Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised oppositional defiant disorder total scores. There were significant pairwise treatment differences at weeks 2 and 5 but not at week 8 postbaseline. A last-observation-carried-forward analysis showed that Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised scores at endpoint for the atomoxetine and placebo groups were significantly different for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms but not for oppositional defiant disorder symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115oYhSW]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, particularly psychosocial interventions, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend including the following educational interventions and individualized instructional supports in the treatment plan for pediatric patients aged 6–18 years with ADHD:

- **School environment**: Tailor the learning atmosphere to facilitate focus and minimize distractions.
- **Class placement**: Consider optimal class size and peer group for the child.
- **Instructional placement**: Align teaching methods with the child's specific learning needs.
- **Behavioral supports**: Implement practical strategies to enhance behavioral outcomes.
- **Individualized education program (IEP)**: Develop a comprehensive plan with targeted goals.
- **Rehabilitation plan (504 plan)**: Establish accommodations to support educational access and success.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder [^114VLfwb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a common clinical problem in children and adolescents. Oppositionality and associated types of aggressive behavior are among the most common referral problems in child psychiatry. Grouped among the disruptive behavior disorders, ODD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric conditions and often precedes the development of conduct disorder (CD), substance abuse, and severely delinquent behavior. Youth with ODD may also have specific CD behaviors, such as aggression. Although compared with CD there exists a smaller and less sophisticated empirical database for ODD, this parameter draws upon the existing ODD and CD literature to make recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment of ODD. The etiology of ODD is complex and its development is based on a cumulative risk/protective factor model that combines biological, psychological, and social factors. Recommended treatment is multimodal and extensive, involving individual and family psychotherapeutic approaches, medication, and sociotherapy. Methodologically sound controlled clinical trials are lacking.

### Guidelines for adolescent depression in primary care (GLAD-PC): Part I. Practice preparation, identification, assessment, and initial management [^113YsthR]. Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

When addressing major depressive disorder in pediatric and adolescent patients, the 2018 AAP guidelines recommend establishing a safety plan. This includes restricting access to lethal means, engaging a concerned third party, and developing an emergency communication mechanism. These steps are crucial if the patient deteriorates, becomes actively suicidal or dangerous to others, or encounters an acute crisis related to psychosocial stressors, particularly during the initial treatment period when safety concerns are most pronounced. It is advised to develop and implement this safety plan within the home environment.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "dual diagnosis": Principles of assessment and management for co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual/developmental disability [^1142Kdn6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Psychopharmacologic approaches to the management of aggression in individuals with IDD and PS are an important tool in the treatment of many patients but should be prescribed only after considering potential environmental precipitants, preceding or ongoing trauma, needs for functional communication training, and behavior support planning. Typically, pharmacological treatment proceeds similarly to aggression in psychiatric syndromes exclusive of IDD; mood-stabilizing agents such as lithium, atypical neuroleptics, and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are most effective but carry a variety of short- and long-term risks.

Consequently, it may be prudent to consider stimulants and alpha agonists as first approaches, especially in IDD syndromes in which aggression may be attributed to ADHD or unspecified impulse control problems; this is particularly common in autism spectrum disorders and represents a significant opportunity for safe, effective amelioration of disruptive behaviors. Anxiolytics can be considered for patients whose aggressive episodes occur in the context of unresolved anxiety, with the caveat that drugs in this class can be disinhibiting and thereby exacerbate aggression in some patients, requiring appropriate caution.

There is extensive literature, including multiple randomized controlled trials, suggesting that risperidone and aripiprazole have the strongest evidence in reducing aggression and irritability in IDD. These interventions can be combined with parent training and other relevant psychosocial interventions.

### Oppositional defiant disorder [^111kJKKo]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Oppositional defiant disorder is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, as a pattern of developmentally inappropriate, negativistic, defiant, and disobedient behavior toward authority figures. This behavior often appears in the preschool years, but initially, it can be difficult to distinguish from developmentally appropriate, albeit troublesome, behavior.

Children who develop a stable pattern of oppositional behavior during their preschool years are likely to go on to have oppositional defiant disorder during their elementary school years. These children have substantially strained relationships with their parents, teachers, and peers, and exhibit high rates of coexisting conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mood disorders. They are also at greater risk of developing conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder during adulthood.

- **Psychological intervention**: Intervention with both the parents and child can substantially improve short- and long-term outcomes. Research supports the effectiveness of parent training and collaborative problem solving. Collaborative problem solving aims to develop a child's skills in tolerating frustration, being flexible, and avoiding emotional overreaction.
- **Coexistence with ADHD**: When oppositional defiant disorder coexists with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, stimulant therapy can reduce the symptoms of both disorders.
