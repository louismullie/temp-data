## Question

How to treat septic shock

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat septic shock. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and activation. Then, I should verify the timing and choice of antimicrobials. Next, I will review fluid resuscitation strategy and dynamic assessment. After that, I need to check vasopressor selection and escalation. I will then examine source control, corticosteroids, and supportive care including ventilation, transfusion, glucose, DVT/ulcer prophylaxis, and nutrition. Finally, I should consider special populations, goals of care, and performance improvement, and I will double-check areas of controversy and correct any misstatements as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: septic shock is a medical emergency, so I need to activate sepsis protocols, obtain at least two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and start resuscitation immediately, ideally with two large-bore IV lines and early involvement of critical care and infectious diseases teams, because delays worsen outcomes [^30e42e8c] [^bd799e16] [^82b256f2].

> Wait, let me verify antimicrobial timing and spectrum. I initially thought "within 1 hour for all suspected sepsis", but hold on, I should correct that: the 2021 SSC recommends immediate antimicrobials within 1 hour for septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis, and for possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment within 3 hours with antimicrobials if infection remains likely, balancing overtreatment risks and local resistance patterns, and using two gram-negative agents when MDR risk is high while avoiding unnecessary double coverage otherwise [^878fabea] [^8b63d9ba] [^ffba560b] [^923d044c] [^e64a8518].

> I need to ensure dosing is optimized. Beta-lactams should be dosed using PK/PD principles, and when feasible, prolonged or continuous infusion improves exposure and may reduce mortality, so I should adjust for renal function and use extended infusions for time-dependent agents whenever possible [^00a5c7d6] [^066d98ad].

> Next, I should review fluids. Let me think about the initial bolus: 30 mL/kg of crystalloid within the first 3 hours is suggested, but I should confirm that this is a weak recommendation and must be individualized; after that, I should use dynamic measures such as passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography to guide further fluids, and I should avoid starches and be cautious with gelatin, while considering balanced crystalloids over saline and adding albumin when substantial crystalloid has been given and shock persists [^cbec34f1] [^4c1843f5] [^4c181e61] [^2cfa511f] [^5a2c1332] [^09fa9124].

> Hold on, I should verify vasopressor choices. Norepinephrine is first-line to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg; if MAP remains inadequate, I should add vasopressin rather than escalating norepinephrine excessively, and if still refractory, I can add epinephrine; I should avoid dopamine except in select bradycardia scenarios, and I must remember that vasopressor initiation should not be delayed while completing fluids in persistent shock [^9c0292c6] [^74b33430].

> I will now examine source control. I need to identify and intervene as soon as medically and logistically feasible, ideally within 6–12 hours, using the least invasive effective approach; delays worsen outcomes, so I should coordinate early surgical or interventional radiology consultation for abscess drainage, device removal, or debridement as indicated [^981cb496] [^8971a9a0] [^ea663766].

> Let me consider corticosteroids. For adults with septic shock requiring ongoing vasopressors, I should consider IV hydrocortisone 200 mg/day, typically 50 mg every 6 hours or continuous infusion, recognizing this accelerates shock resolution and reduces vasopressor needs without a clear mortality benefit; I should avoid routine steroids if shock resolves with fluids and vasopressors alone [^6dabb9fe] [^15f5d797] [^066d98ad].

> Next, I should review supportive care. For respiratory failure, I will use lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and limit plateau pressures, consider prone positioning for severe ARDS, and prefer high-flow nasal oxygen over NIV when feasible; for transfusion, I will target hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL unless there is tissue hypoperfusion, coronary ischemia, or acute hemorrhage; for glucose, I will start insulin when levels exceed 180 mg/dL and target ≤ 180 mg/dL; I will provide DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis, and start enteral nutrition within 48 hours when tolerated [^9c0292c6] [^066d98ad].

> But wait, what if the patient is pediatric or pregnant? For children, I should use 20 mL/kg crystalloid boluses up to 40–60 mL/kg in the first hour, titrate to perfusion, and use dopamine or epinephrine as first-line vasoactives rather than norepinephrine; for pregnancy, I should maintain higher MAP targets and prioritize left uterine displacement and maternal resuscitation to preserve fetal perfusion, adapting source control to gestational considerations [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I should double-check goals of care and communication. Early discussions with patients and families within 72 hours are recommended, and I should integrate palliative care principles when appropriate, using shared decision-making for escalation and discharge planning, especially in high-risk or refractory cases [^49d10e48] [^4de36fe1] [^b1756127] [^7c456710].

> Next, I should review performance improvement. Implementing sepsis screening, sepsis bundles, and standardized operating procedures improves adherence and outcomes, so I need to ensure audit, feedback, and education are embedded locally, and I should track time-to-antibiotics, fluid administration, lactate measurement, and source control timing as key metrics [^049021e1] [^8577e509].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about controversies. Early goal-directed therapy with central venous oximetry has not shown mortality benefit in modern RCTs, so I should individualize hemodynamic targets and avoid rigid protocols; likewise, while balanced crystalloids may be preferred, the mortality signal is modest and context-dependent, so I should tailor fluid choice to patient factors and availability; and although vitamin C has been explored, current evidence does not support routine use, so I should avoid it outside trials [^41f440f3] [^bf277eff] [^2cfa511f] [^e4501df2].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: immediate recognition and cultures, rapid antimicrobials tailored to risk, 30 mL/kg crystalloid with dynamic assessment, norepinephrine-first vasopressor strategy, urgent source control, selective hydrocortisone, and comprehensive supportive care, all aligned with early goals-of-care discussions and continuous quality improvement to reduce mortality and morbidity in septic shock [^03ca604d] [^30e42e8c] [^878fabea] [^cbec34f1] [^9c0292c6] [^981cb496] [^6dabb9fe].

Treat septic shock with **immediate recognition and resuscitation** [^30e42e8c], **early broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** [^878fabea], and **rapid source control** [^8971a9a0]. Give **30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours** [^cbec34f1] [^4c1843f5], then titrate to dynamic response [^4c181e61]; start norepinephrine if MAP remains < 65 mmHg despite fluids [^9c0292c6]. Add vasopressin or epinephrine if needed [^9c0292c6], and consider hydrocortisone for persistent vasopressor-dependent shock [^6dabb9fe] [^15f5d797]. Support organs with lung-protective ventilation, restrictive transfusion, glucose control, and DVT/stress ulcer prophylaxis [^9c0292c6]. Personalize care with dynamic monitoring [^4c181e61] and reassess frequently to avoid fluid overload and tailor therapy [^f2fc0db5].

---

## Immediate recognition and initial assessment

- **Early recognition**: Identify septic shock promptly using clinical signs (hypotension, altered mentation, oliguria, hyperlactatemia) and initiate sepsis protocols immediately [^30e42e8c] [^bd799e16].

- **Initial assessment**: Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible, but do not delay therapy if unstable [^5894d787]. Perform rapid history, exam, and targeted labs (CBC, lactate, renal/hepatic panels, coagulation profile) [^notfound].

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Use continuous arterial pressure and frequent vital sign checks; consider echocardiography or invasive monitoring in refractory cases [^bf277eff].

---

## Early antimicrobial therapy

- **Timing**: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition [^878fabea] [^186508f4]; delays increase mortality [^2a28f2bc].

- **Empiric coverage**: Tailor to local resistance patterns, risk factors (e.g. MRSA, Pseudomonas), and severity; use two gram-negative agents if MDR risk is high [^923d044c].

- **Source control**: Identify and intervene urgently (drainage, debridement, device removal) within 6–12 hours when possible [^981cb496] [^8971a9a0].

---

## Hemodynamic resuscitation

### Fluid resuscitation

- **Initial fluids**: Give 30 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid within 3 hours [^cbec34f1] [^4c1843f5]; use balanced crystalloids when available [^2cfa511f] [^45f9e586].

- **Dynamic assessment**: Guide further fluids with passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, or echocardiography to avoid overload [^4c181e61] [^cbec34f1].

- **Fluid responsiveness**: Reassess after each bolus; stop if no hemodynamic improvement or signs of overload appear [^9c0292c6].

---

### Vasopressor therapy

Start **norepinephrine** as the first-line vasopressor to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^9c0292c6]. Add **vasopressin** if MAP remains inadequate at norepinephrine doses ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min, and consider **epinephrine** as an alternative or adjunct in refractory cases [^9c0292c6]. Initiate vasopressors early when hypotension persists despite fluids [^9c0292c6].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Corticosteroids**: Use IV hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for persistent vasopressor-dependent shock [^6dabb9fe] [^15f5d797].

- **Blood products**: Transfuse to hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL unless ischemia or active bleeding is present [^9c0292c6].

- **Glucose control**: Target 140–180 mg/dL with insulin [^9c0292c6].

- **DVT/stress ulcer prophylaxis**: Provide standard prophylaxis [^9c0292c6].

---

## Organ support and monitoring

- **Respiratory support**: Use lung-protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg PBW, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O) for ARDS; consider prone positioning for severe hypoxemia [^9c0292c6].

- **Renal support**: Initiate continuous or intermittent renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury with indications [^9c0292c6].

- **Neurologic monitoring**: Assess mental status and sedation needs; avoid oversedation [^9c0292c6].

---

## Individualized and dynamic management

Personalize therapy by adapting to **patient-specific factors** — age, comorbidities, and infection source — and continuously reassess hemodynamics, organ function, and response to interventions [^dea649d1] [^895985ca]. Avoid **fluid overload** by using dynamic measures and de-escalating fluids once perfusion improves [^4c181e61] [^f2fc0db5].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and follow-up

Engage **early involvement** of critical care, infectious diseases, and specialty consultants to optimize source control and organ support [^notfound]. Provide **post-ICU care** with rehabilitation, mental health support, and follow-up for long-term sequelae [^notfound].

### The management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^fdab4945]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is a complex and dynamic process. Newer evidence-based interventions are constantly being developed and implemented with the purpose of improving morbidity and mortality. Current investigations are being performed in hospital environments to determine the change in behaviors and clinical impact with the most recent recommendations. The use of standardized treatment protocols in addition to newer diagnostic and treatment modalities in patients who have severe sepsis and septic shock can continue to improve patient-related outcomes and the damaging effect of these diseases on society.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^97af1a5f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Does early and appropriate antibiotic administration improve mortality in emergency department patients with severe sepsis or septic shock? [^2a28f2bc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock remain significant public health concerns. Appropriate emergency department management includes early recognition, hemodynamic resuscitation, source control, and prompt antibiotic administration. Current international guidelines strongly recommend administration of early and appropriate antibiotics for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Interestingly, a recent Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to provide a similar recommendation on antibiotic administration. The goal of this literature search was to systematically review the available literature on early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy and provide emergency physicians an evidence-based approach to antibiotic therapy for septic patients.

Methods

Four PubMed searches were completed to identify abstracts of relevant interest. We limited studies to those completed in adult humans that were composed in English between 2005 and 2015. Included studies were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective trials, and retrospective cohort studies. These studies were identified by a rigorous search methodology. No review articles, case series, or case reports were included. Predefined criteria were used to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of selected articles as part of a structured review.

Results

A total of 1552 abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. After the review of these studies, 14 were included for formal review. The authors then systematically evaluated each study, which formed the basis for this clinical statement.

Conclusions

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock should receive early and appropriate antibiotics in the emergency department. Patients with septic shock who received appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 1 h of recognition had the greatest benefit in mortality.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^28e13503]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

Design

A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or best practice statement when applicable.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four questions.

Conclusions

Substantial agreement exists among a large cohort of international experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for these critically ill patients with high mortality.

### Surviving sepsis: updated guidelines from the society of… [^066d98ad]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Epinephrine can be considered if goals are not met with norepinephrine and vasopressin. For hypoperfusion with adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, adding dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone are options.

When beta-lactam antibiotics are used, prolonged intravenous infusions after an initial bolus improve antibiotic concentrations over intermittent boluses and reduce short-term mortality. Source Control Controlling the source of infection, including abscess drainage, necrotic tissue debridement, and removing potentially infective devices, is key in management of sepsis. Source control improves survival and is recommended after initial resuscitation. Ventilation INITIAL VENTILATORY SUPPORT In sepsis-induced hypoxic respiratory failure, high-flow nasal oxygen is recommended over noninvasive ventilation because of improved 90-day survival and lower intubation rates. Compared with conventional oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen reduces intubations but not mortality. As long as light sedation can be maintained, intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents appear to be safer than continuous infusions.

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduces mortality in expert centers when mechanical ventilation fails. Additional Therapies CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY In patients with septic shock requiring ongoing vasopressor therapy, intravenous corticosteroids accelerate resolution of shock by 1. 5 days and reduce vasopressor requirements without a clear effect on mortality. Typical dosing is hydrocortisone, 200 mg daily, given after four hours of vasopressor therapy as a continuous infusion or every six hours. Corticosteroid use increases neuromuscular weakness.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^96cf3761]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built upon a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along 5 levels to create recommendation grades from A-E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Participants

Participants included 44 critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations.

Results

A total of 46 recommendations plus pediatric management considerations.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that will hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually, and even more rapidly when some important new knowledge becomes available.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^5894d787]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^a97e8ac4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^5d87c683]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^7663b3e0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

Introduction

Shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues. Septic shock is one of the most common causes of shock in the ICU. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines provide excellent guidance for the management of septic patients, but for several reasons there is room for personalization. First, although these guidelines are supported by evidence, they are based primarily on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the response of large groups of patients to an intervention. These trials are generally negative, i.e. do not reveal differences in mortality. It is important to recognize that individual patient specificities may affect the response or tolerance to a given intervention. Second, many areas of resuscitation are still a matter of debate and research gaps remain. Hence, guidelines often fail to offer strong and precise recommendations in specific areas. Third, there are different phases in the management of shock, each requiring a different approach. Thus, it may be justified to individualize the therapeutic options according to the patient's condition. In this expert opinion paper, we discuss the different options regarding the personalization of hemodynamic monitoring and management of septic shock patients, at the various stages of shock. The general principle of personalized shock management is to measure, interpret, apply therapy, evaluate its effects, and react, in contrast to applying standard measures.

Goals of care in sepsis and septic shock — recommendations 74–76: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families over no such discussion (best practice statement). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest addressing goals of care early (within 72 hours) over late (72 hours or later) (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for any specific standardized criterion to trigger goals of care discussion.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — duration of antibiotics: For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence. As rationale, the guideline states that for adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest a shorter course of antibiotics, as this is less costly, has fewer undesirable effects without impacting adversely on outcomes.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^1c657dea]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^1fedd28a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^9c0292c6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FI O₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^fd42bbf4]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D636) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: 1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; 2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; 3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; 4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; 5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and 6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

Severe sepsis and septic shock have great relevance to Emergency Medicine physicians because of their high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Treatment is time-sensitive, depends on early identification risk stratification, and has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of, and evidence basis for, the emergency department management of severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^e64a8518]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Severe sepsis and septic shock: review of the literature and emergency department management guidelines [^263a1a9a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis and septic shock are as common and lethal as other acute life-threatening conditions that emergency physicians routinely confront such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and trauma. Recent studies have led to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and the development of new or newly applied therapies. These therapies place early and aggressive management of severe sepsis and septic shock as integral to improving outcome. This independent review of the literature examines the recent pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances in severe sepsis and septic shock for adults, with particular relevance to emergency practice. Recommendations are provided for therapies that have been shown to improve outcomes, including early goal-directed therapy, early and appropriate antimicrobials, source control, recombinant human activated protein C, corticosteroids, and low tidal volume mechanical ventilation.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^11954711]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^8ceefb36]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines provide a suitable framework to guide therapy for the majority of patients with septic shock. Appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy, source control if indicated, fluid therapy, and targeted vasopressors remain the backbone of treatment. However, a small proportion of patients fail to respond to these measures and deteriorate precipitously into refractory shock and progressive multi-organ failure. This subgroup of patients is often poorly represented in large randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of interventions in septic shock. As a result, there is little conclusive evidence to guide management in this particular population.

Refractory septic shock is variably defined as the presence of hypotension, with end-organ dysfunction, requiring high-dose vasopressor support often greater than 0.5 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent. Regardless of the precise definition, there is an associated mortality of up to 60%. Furthermore, patients with vasopressor requirements greater than 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent who continue to deteriorate clinically have a reported mortality as high as 80–90%. Microcirculatory failure and associated ischaemic consequences are frequently observed and alternative therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to improve outcomes in this small subgroup of critically ill patients.

In this viewpoint article we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock. The list of interventions described below is drawn from our clinical experience managing patients with confirmed, or suspected, toxin-producing bacteria in a specialist Severe Respiratory Failure centre in the UK. It is recognised that some of these interventions lack a robust evidence base. Our intention is not to rehearse the current evidence for each component of therapy, but merely to describe our institutional approach with brief reference to selected relevant literature.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — biomarkers to discontinue antibiotics: For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control where optimal duration of therapy is unclear, we suggest using procalcitonin AND clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials over clinical evaluation alone.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — source control timing and approach in sepsis and septic shock specifies that source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation. Smaller studies suggest that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous, and studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of the limited number of patients and the heterogeneity of the intervention. Any required source control intervention should ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made, and prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. In general, the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control should be pursued; open surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion; surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists; and logistic factors unique to each institution may also play a role in the decision.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — timing of antimicrobials in pediatric sepsis states that in children with septic shock, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible and ideally within 1 hour of recognition, and despite very low quality of evidence the panel provides a strong recommendation that most clinicians should seek to initiate antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after recognition of septic shock in most situations. For children without clinical signs of shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after sepsis recognition, while allowing up to 3 hours for appropriate diagnostic investigation for patients without clinical signs of shock and for those with an uncertain diagnosis. During evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed expeditiously and, if and when the evaluation supports a likely infection or evidence of septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction becomes manifest, antimicrobial therapy should be immediately administered.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^c3910a51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, patients with sepsis should complete the sepsis bundle within three hours of presentation. 24–27 Vasopressor therapy is initiated if the patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. 21, 28, 29 Infection source control with early surgical consultation should be obtained for suspected infections requiring operative or other interventional treatment. Treatment FLUID RESUSCITATION The priorities in early sepsis management are establishing vascular access and initiating fluid resuscitation. Patients with sepsis should receive an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. 21 Infusing an initial 1-L bolus over the first 30 minutes is an accepted approach. The remainder of fluid resuscitation should be given by repeat bolus infusions.

43 Infusion of intravenous fluids in this manner enhances preload and cardiac output, thereby improving oxygen delivery. However, the hemodynamic effects of fluid boluses in sepsis last only 60 minutes.
44. Several individual trials showed no difference in 28-day mortality benefit between resuscitation using a colloid and a crystalloid; however, a subsequent meta-analysis suggested a marginal mortality benefit with the use of albumin. 26, 45–47 Despite these findings, crystalloids are recommended for fluid resuscitation because of availability and lower cost. 48 Regardless of the fluid used, frequent reassessment of fluid balance beyond initial resuscitation is recommended to avoid under- or overhydration. Dynamic blood pressure response, tissue perfusion, and most importantly urine output can be used to help avoid volume overload, particularly in patients with chronic renal disease, heart failure, or acute lung injury. 49 Fluid administration should be restricted in the latter phases of sepsis management. At 72 hours, the net fluid balance goal should be close to zero or slightly negative. Each 1-L increase in net positive balance at 72 hours is associated with increased risk of death.

Scope and intent — patient population and use of these guidelines: The objective is to provide guidance for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Recommendations are intended to guide "best practice" rather than to establish a treatment algorithm or to define standard of care. These guidelines are appropriate for treating septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in a hospital, emergency, or acute care setting. The panel intended these guidelines to apply to all patients from greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation at birth to 18 years old with severe sepsis or septic shock as defined by the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference or inclusive of severe infection leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction, and practically include all infants, children, and adolescents with septic shock or other sepsis-associated acute organ dysfunction.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — palliative care in adults with sepsis or septic shock states: we recommend integrating principles of palliative care (which may include palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement) into the treatment plan, when appropriate, to address patient and family symptoms and suffering (best practice statement), and we suggest against routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients over palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting rationale notes that palliative care interventions had no significant impact on family satisfaction with care, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, or mortality, and that overall evidence for routine formal ICU palliative care is of low quality with mixed benefit, although one structured intervention reduced anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in family members 90 days after the patient's death. The panel therefore made a best practice statement recommending incorporation of palliative care principles in the care of patients with sepsis and septic shock.

Increased attention has focused recently on the acute management of severe sepsis and septic shock, conditions that represent the end-stage systemic deterioration of overwhelming infection. Clinical trials have identified new therapies and management approaches that, when applied early, appear to reduce mortality. Practice guidelines have been advanced by critical care societies, and many of the proposed interventions involve therapies other than antimicrobials directed at hemodynamic resuscitation or addressing adverse effects of the inflammatory cascade. Although many emergency departments (EDs) are now adopting treatment protocols for sepsis that are based on published treatment guidelines, recent research calls many of the initial recommendations into question, and validation trials of some of these approaches are ongoing. This article reviews the initial evaluation and treatment considerations of sepsis in the ED setting.

### Choice of vasopressor in septic shock: does it matter? [^8c7dbd9c]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Septic shock is a medical emergency that is associated with mortality rates of 40–70%. Prompt recognition and institution of effective therapy is required for optimal outcome. When the shock state persists after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy is required to improve and maintain adequate tissue/organ perfusion in an attempt to improve survival and prevent the development of multiple organ dysfunction and failure. Controversy surrounding the optimum choice of vasopressor strategy to utilize in the management of patients with septic shock continues. A recent randomized study of epinephrine compared to norepinephrine (plus dobutamine when indicated) leads to more questions than answers.

### Septic shock: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^bf277eff]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Septic shock is a clinical emergency that occurs in more than 230,000 US patients each year. OBSERVATIONS AND ADVANCES: In the setting of suspected or documented infection, septic shock is typically defined in a clinical setting by low systolic (≤ 90 mm Hg) or mean arterial blood pressure (≤ 65 mm Hg) accompanied by signs of hypoperfusion (eg, oliguria, hyperlactemia, poor peripheral perfusion, or altered mental status). Focused ultrasonography is recommended for the prompt recognition of complicating physiology (eg, hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock), while invasive hemodynamic monitoring is recommended only for select patients. In septic shock, 3 randomized clinical trials demonstrate that protocolized care offers little advantage compared with management without a protocol. Hydroxyethyl starch is no longer recommended, and debate continues about the role of various crystalloid solutions and albumin.

Conclusions and Relevance

The prompt diagnosis of septic shock begins with obtainment of medical history and performance of a physical examination for signs and symptoms of infection and may require focused ultrasonography to recognize more complex physiologic manifestations of shock. Clinicians should understand the importance of prompt administration of intravenous fluids and vasoactive medications aimed at restoring adequate circulation, and the limitations of protocol-based therapy, as guided by recent evidence.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^a7c1810f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these critically ill patients.

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^41f440f3]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Conventional management that focuses on early antibiotics and targeted resuscitation has contributed to improvements in survival of patients with septic shock over the last decade. New evidence from the ProCESS, ARISE and PRoMISe trials, however, suggests that structured 'early goal-directed resuscitation' with routine placement of a central venous catheter, monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation and aggressive red cell transfusion does not improve outcomes in most patients with septic shock. The nuances of fluid and vasopressor administration in early septic shock remain incompletely defined. Further, development and validation of practical methods for accurately assessing optimal fluid administration is needed. Future studies that seek to address these issues will likely benefit from emerging novel techniques, including molecular diagnostics and adaptive trial designs.

### Management of septic shock: current concepts, with a particular emphasis on the role of source control, and future perspectives [^8aff750c]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Sepsis is an infection-induced syndrome characterized by a generalized inflammatory state. The normal reaction to infection involves a series of complex immunological processes. A potent, complex immunological cascade ensures a prompt protective response to microbial invasion in human beings. Although activation of the immune system during microbial invasion is generally protective, septic shock develops in a number of patients as a consequence of excessive or poorly regulated immune response to the offending organism. This unbalanced reaction may harm the host through a maladaptive release of endogenously generated inflammatory compounds. Early recognition of the syndrome is of key importance to promptly start appropriate management. Timely, aggressive resuscitation to preserve organ function remains a fundamental principle in the care of septic patients. The specific treatment is directed at identifying and treating the underlying disorder. The physician should investigate diligently for the presence of active infection using modern imaging methods and other diagnostic studies to localize the site of infection and to obtain adequate culture specimens from potential infective sources. Early administration of appropriate, effective antibiotic therapy is important in the management of septic patients. Infected fluid collections and/or infected necrotic tissues should be drained or debrided without delay. Adequate nutritional support is indicated in the management of the septic patient. A number of adjuvant therapies, aimed at blunting/downregulating the host immune response to bacterial infection are currently under intensive investigation; however, the complexity of immunological defences and the potential for complementary interaction of the different components of the inflammatory cascade make the development of these pharmacological interventions difficult.

### How we escalate vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock [^74b33430]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is defined by the need for vasopressor agents to correct hypotension and lactic acidosis resulting from infection, with 30%-40% case fatality rates. The care of patients with worsening septic shock involves multiple treatment decisions involving vasopressor choices and adjunctive treatments. In this edition of "How I Do It", we provide a case-based discussion of common clinical decisions regarding choice of first-line vasopressor, BP targets, route of vasopressor delivery, use of secondary vasopressors, and adjunctive medications. We also consider diagnostic approaches, treatment, and monitoring strategies for the patient with worsening shock, as well as approaches to difficult weaning of vasopressors.

### Sepsis bundles: just do it [^8577e509]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients with septic shock appears to be critical in terms of determining outcome; a standardized systematic approach for the management of patients with severe infections appears to consistently improve the delivery of recommended therapies and, as a result, may improve patient outcomes. With minimal-to-no risk or acquisition costs, severe sepsis bundle implementation should become the standard of care for the management of septic shock. A multifaceted approach may aid in the success of implementation of sepsis bundles in teaching and nonteaching institutions. Bundle implementation should change clinical practice by including surveillance, feedback reporting, and staff education to organize the target interventions into packages that must be implemented in strict compliance, for every patient, to ensure uniformity and provide practical applicability. Quality improvement via utilization of protocols can be achieved, regardless of institution size or academic status, and should continue to be promoted in the intensive care unit setting.

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Haemodynamic support for paediatric septic shock: a global perspective [^58ed7b6c]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Septic shock is a leading cause of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality for children worldwide. In 2020, the paediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) issued evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children with septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction based on the evidence available at the time. There are now more trials from multiple settings, including low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), addressing optimal fluid choice and amount, selection and timing of vasoactive infusions, and optimal monitoring and therapeutic endpoints. In response to developments in adult critical care to trial personalised haemodynamic management algorithms, it is timely to critically reassess the current state of applying SSC guidelines in LMIC settings. In this Viewpoint, we briefly outline the challenges to improve sepsis care in LMICs and then discuss three key concepts that are relevant to management of children with septic shock around the world, especially in LMICs. These concepts include uncertainties surrounding the early recognition of paediatric septic shock, choices for initial haemodynamic support, and titration of ongoing resuscitation to therapeutic endpoints. Specifically, given the evolving understanding of clinical phenotypes, we focus on the controversies surrounding the concepts of early fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agent use, including insights gained from experience in LMICs and high-income countries. We outline the key components of sepsis management that are both globally relevant and translatable to low-resource settings, with a view to open the conversation to the large variety of treatment pathways, especially in LMICs. We emphasise the role of simple and easily available monitoring tools to apply the SSC guidelines and to tailor individualised support to the patient's cardiovascular physiology.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^f4f9218a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis remains the most common cause of vasodilatory shock worldwide. International consensus guidelines describe specific recommendations regarding treatment. These include the timing of important interventions comprising blood culture collection, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood glucose targets, use of steroids, and restoration of optimal hemodynamic status. The mainstay of treatment with regard to restoring and maintaining optimal hemodynamic status is rapid and appropriate fluid bolus therapy (FBT) which, if insufficient, is followed by vasopressor therapy to maintain an acceptable mean arterial pressure (MAP). Despite this approach being a cornerstone of therapeutic guidelines, there is a lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating a survival benefit associated with the use of one vasopressor over another. Although current consensus guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor, both selection and timing of second-line therapy in refractory hypotension due to septic shock is highly variable. Indeed, in a recent survey of practice, only 14% of respondents cited a predefined dose of the first agent as the stimulus for additional therapy. Selection of the vasopressor agent is also variable and further complicated by the recent data related to a "new" vasopressor, angiotensin II, which is currently only available in the USA.

For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence); dynamic parameters include response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus, using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography, where available.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^b4da70dd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

### Adjunctive treatments for the management of septic shock-a narrative review of the current evidence [^e4501df2]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The cornerstones of management include prompt identification of sepsis, early initiation of antibiotic therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and organ support. Over the past two decades, there have been considerable improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the host response, including regulation of inflammation, endothelial disruption and impaired immunity. This has offered opportunities for innovative adjunctive treatments such as vitamin C, corticosteroids and beta-blockers. Some of these approaches have shown promising results in early phase trials in humans, while others, such as corticosteroids, have been tested in large, international, multicentre randomised controlled trials. Contemporary guidelines make a weak recommendation for the use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in sepsis and septic shock. Vitamin C, despite showing initial promise in observational studies, has so far not been shown to be clinically effective in randomised trials. Beta-blocker therapy may have beneficial cardiac and non-cardiac effects in septic shock, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use for this condition. The results of ongoing randomised trials are awaited. Crucial to reducing heterogeneity in the trials of new sepsis treatments will be the concept of enrichment, which refers to the purposive selection of patients with clinical and biological characteristics that are likely to be responsive to the intervention being tested.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^f2fc0db5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The first therapeutic measure in septic shock, volume expansion, is seemingly simple: a few hundred millilitres of fluid injected intravenously over a few minutes. However, nothing is simple in the strategy of using fluids in septic patients. Several different types of fluids are available today. The effects of a fluid bolus are inconsistent and transient. Fluids are risky treatments, particularly during septic shock. Then, many questions raise in practice. Which fluid to choose? Should it be infused? How to evaluate its risk and refrain from infusing it? How to predict its effects? How to evaluate them?

To these questions, one can provide a standard and unequivocal answer. This is what the current guidelines do, without distinguishing according to the clinical context and the patient characteristics. The aim is likely to make them general enough to be applied widely, which is undoubtedly laudable. Another reason is that these guidelines are based on existing randomized controlled trials, which have often paid little attention to the particularities of patients they included. So, while these recommendations are of great value, there is probably room for a more personalized fluid management. Contrary to a "universal" strategy, the idea that "one size does not fit all" has been defended for many years about several strategies in critical care medicine. The need for personalization of treatment has emerged as a virtuous goal to pursue, especially in septic shock. This is the case for fluids as for any other treatment.

In this review, we will describe what a personalized fluid strategy in septic shock can be, based not only on the existing publications, but also on the pathophysiological concepts underlying the effects of fluids. From the choice of fluid type to the decision to remove the fluid administered in excess, we will try to show that, at each stage, the choices can reasonably be individualized.

How to customize the choice of fluid type?

Table 2 — implications of the strength of recommendation — Strong recommendation is paired with "Usually high or moderate" quality and implies for patients that "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action", and for policymakers that it "Can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators". Weak recommendation has "Any" quality, with patient implication "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not", clinician implication "Different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances", and policy implication "Policies will likely be variable". A Best practice statement has "Strong" strength but "Ungraded" quality with implications "Same as strong recommendation", while an In our practice statement is "Not a recommendation" with "NA" implications.

Hemodynamic management — fluid management recommendations specify crystalloid preference and colloid avoidance as follows: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids over using crystalloids alone (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend against using starches for resuscitation (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we suggest against using gelatin for resuscitation (Weak recommendation, moderate quality).

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### Antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: an evidence-based review [^458fb45b]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

Since the prompt institution of therapy that is active against the causative pathogen is one of the most important predictors of outcome, clinicians must establish a system for rapid administration of a rationally chosen drug or combination of drugs when sepsis or septic shock is suspected. The expanding number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents available provides opportunities for effective empiric and specific therapy. However, to minimize the promotion of antimicrobial resistance and cost and to maximize efficacy, detailed knowledge of the likely pathogens and the properties of the available drugs is necessary for the intensivist.
