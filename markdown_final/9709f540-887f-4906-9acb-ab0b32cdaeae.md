## Question

Best image to control endometriosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging modality is best to control endometriosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "best" means clinically in terms of diagnostic accuracy, preoperative mapping, and longitudinal surveillance. Then, I should verify the comparative strengths and limitations of transvaginal ultrasound versus MRI across endometriosis phenotypes. Next, I will review high-credibility guideline recommendations to anchor the diagnostic pathway. After that, I should examine the evidence for postoperative surveillance and follow-up imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, scenario-based recommendation that aligns with current standards and evidence quality, while acknowledging areas of uncertainty and operator dependence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "best image to control endometriosis" implies optimizing diagnosis, mapping disease extent for surgery, and enabling surveillance after treatment. I need to ensure I'm not conflating imaging that guides control with imaging that treats the disease, because imaging is diagnostic and does not itself control endometriosis, even though it informs medical and surgical management decisions that do control symptoms and disease progression.

> Next, I should review the two principal modalities. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is first-line because it is widely available, cost-effective, and accurate for ovarian endometriomas and many deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) sites when performed with dedicated protocols and expertise; however, it is operator dependent and can miss superficial peritoneal disease and some extragenital sites, so a negative scan does not exclude endometriosis [^111MguHP] [^114UfQA6] [^117CEkk2]. MRI offers multiplanar soft-tissue contrast, a panoramic view of all pelvic compartments, and superior mapping of deep lesions, ureteral involvement, and pelvic nerves; it is less operator dependent but more resource intensive and still can miss very small or superficial implants, so a negative MRI also does not fully exclude disease [^111Zdafi] [^111fAnkq] [^117CEkk2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify diagnostic performance by phenotype. For endometrioma, TVUS performs excellently and approaches replacement-test characteristics in meta-analytic data, whereas MRI is also highly accurate but may be less necessary when TVUS clearly characterizes a classic endometrioma; for DIE, TVUS has high specificity but moderate sensitivity, while MRI achieves high sensitivity and is particularly strong for rectosigmoid, bladder, ureteral, and lateral compartment disease, including pelvic nerves, which are critical for surgical planning and complication avoidance [^115RTd9k] [^116yNWDM] [^1177vqxD]. I should double-check that these conclusions are consistent with contemporary reviews and consensus statements, which they are, including ESUR and ACR guidance emphasizing MRI for complex or equivocal cases and for preoperative mapping [^117QH7t1] [^111Zdafi].

> I will now examine guideline hierarchies to anchor the pathway. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend TVUS as initial imaging for suspected pelvic endometriosis and MRI as the next study when ultrasound is negative or indeterminate, with MRI also preferred for preoperative planning and for persistent symptoms after surgery. ESHRE similarly recommends ultrasound or MRI in the diagnostic work-up and individualizes follow-up, while SOGC advises TVUS first and MRI when advanced ultrasound is unavailable or suspicion for DIE remains high. ACOG historically endorsed TVUS as the imaging modality of choice in assessment, aligning with this first-line ultrasound approach [^111MguHP] [^111Zdafi] [^115gvVQf] [^117CEkk2] [^114b729A] [^114UfQA6] [^117KFxMB] [^113n66z2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging in postoperative control and surveillance. The ACR specifically recommends contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI as follow-up imaging for established postoperative endometriosis with new or ongoing symptoms, which supports MRI as the preferred modality for detecting residual or recurrent disease and for guiding reintervention. This is echoed by radiology reviews emphasizing MRI's ability to distinguish postoperative changes from recurrence and to map disease for reoperation planning [^115gvVQf] [^111KLk1E]. I should confirm that this does not imply routine MRI for all asymptomatic patients; rather, it is symptom-driven and individualized, consistent with ESHRE's follow-up principles [^114b729A].

> Let me consider special populations and technical nuances. In adolescents or when TVUS is not feasible due to pain, vaginismus, or virginity, MRI or alternative sonographic approaches can be first-line. Bowel-prep TVUS and rectal water-contrast TVUS improve detection of rectosigmoid DIE and can rival MRI in experienced hands, but availability and expertise vary. Conversely, high-quality MRI at 3T with optimized sequences can achieve excellent diagnostic performance even without bowel preparation in some centers, though protocols and local expertise matter greatly [^113SNNUU] [^114G6u8P] [^115ZSUhk]. I need to ensure I emphasize that modality performance is protocol- and operator-dependent, which is repeatedly underscored in comparative reviews and consensus documents [^116yNWDM] [^117QH7t1].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is specifically about bowel or nerve involvement. I should confirm that MRI is particularly advantageous for mapping rectosigmoid DIE, assessing bowel wall invasion, and evaluating ureteral and pelvic nerve disease, where TVUS has blind spots; indeed, MRI consistently outperforms standard TVUS for these extragenital and lateral compartment sites, and structured MR reporting with compartment-based analysis and drawings improves surgical planning and patient counseling, which directly supports "control" of disease through better operative strategy and complication prevention [^111fAnkq] [^1177vqxD] [^113JK8Eh] [^115jc6rB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI might be uniformly "best" across scenarios, but I should correct that. For initial diagnosis of suspected endometriosis, especially to detect endometriomas and common DIE sites cost-effectively, expert TVUS is the appropriate first step, with MRI reserved for inconclusive studies, complex anatomy, suspected extragenital disease, or preoperative mapping. Conversely, for postoperative surveillance of symptoms or for comprehensive mapping where surgical risk is high, MRI is preferred. Thus, the "best" modality is context-dependent rather than universal [^111MguHP] [^111Zdafi] [^115gvVQf].

> Synthesizing this, I should state the practical answer clearly. For initial diagnostic work-up and identification of endometriomas and many DIE lesions, start with high-quality TVUS performed by an experienced sonographer using dedicated endometriosis protocols. If TVUS is negative or indeterminate but clinical suspicion remains, or if you need detailed mapping of deep lesions, ureteral or nerve involvement, or persistent/recurrent disease after surgery, proceed to pelvic MRI with appropriate sequences and, when needed, contrast enhancement. In postoperative patients with new or ongoing symptoms, prioritize contrast-enhanced MRI for surveillance. Throughout, interpret negative imaging cautiously because superficial peritoneal disease can be invisible on both modalities and clinical correlation remains essential [^111MguHP] [^111Zdafi] [^115gvVQf] [^117CEkk2].

> Finally, I should confirm that this approach aligns with current evidence and guidelines and note limitations. No single imaging test replaces laparoscopy in all contexts, and both TVUS and MRI can miss subtle disease; operator expertise and standardized protocols substantially influence performance, and access and cost constraints may modify the sequence in practice; nonetheless, the modern paradigm endorsed by major societies is a noninvasive-first strategy using TVUS followed by MRI as indicated, which reduces diagnostic delay, guides timely therapy, and optimizes surgical control of endometriosis [^117CEkk2] [^111MguHP] [^111Zdafi] [^113qsDGE].

The best imaging modality to control endometriosis is **transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** for initial assessment and monitoring because it is highly accurate for endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) [^115RTd9k], is widely available, and is cost-effective [^113Xahfr]. MRI is the **preferred second-line modality** [^111Zdafi] when TVUS is inconclusive or when detailed mapping is needed for surgical planning, especially for DIE involving bowel, bladder, or ureters [^11225YXw]. No single modality is definitive for all cases [^117CEkk2]; use TVUS first, then MRI as indicated, and tailor follow-up to symptoms and treatment response [^114b729A].

## Comparative accuracy of imaging modalities

| **Attribute** | **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** | **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** | **Computed tomography (CT)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Accuracy for endometriomas | High sensitivity (93%) and specificity (96%) [^115RTd9k] | High sensitivity (95%) and specificity (91%) [^115RTd9k] | Limited accuracy; not recommended [^1148Tdbc] |
| Accuracy for DIE | Moderate sensitivity (79%) and high specificity (94%) [^115RTd9k] | High sensitivity (94%) and moderate specificity (77%) [^115RTd9k] | Limited accuracy; not recommended [^1148Tdbc] |
| Operator dependence | High | Moderate | Low |
| Availability | Widely available | Limited availability | Widely available |
| Cost | Cost-effective | More expensive | More expensive |
| Radiation exposure | None | None | Yes |

---

TVUS is **highly accurate for endometriomas and DIE** [^115RTd9k], with sensitivity and specificity around 79–93% and 94–96%, respectively. MRI provides **superior soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging** [^113prPGB] [^116LPy6R], making it highly effective for detailed mapping of DIE, especially when bowel, bladder, or ureteral involvement is suspected [^113Xahfr]. CT is generally **not recommended** due to limited accuracy and radiation exposure [^1148Tdbc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

ACOG recommends TVUS as the **initial imaging modality** for suspected endometriosis, particularly for evaluating ovarian endometriomas and deep infiltrating lesions [^113n66z2]. ACR recommends **pelvic MRI** as the next imaging modality when TVUS is inconclusive or when detailed mapping is required for surgical planning [^111Zdafi]. ESHRE recommends **individualized follow-up** based on disease severity, symptoms, and treatment response, with imaging tailored to clinical needs [^114b729A].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Patient factors**: TVUS is less suitable for patients with severe pain, vaginismus, or those who cannot tolerate transvaginal examinations. MRI is preferred in these scenarios [^117QH7t1].
- **Resource availability**: TVUS is widely available and cost-effective, making it the preferred initial imaging modality in most settings. MRI availability may be limited in some regions, necessitating the use of TVUS as the primary modality [^112NNk8i].
- **Clinical scenario**: For initial diagnosis and monitoring, TVUS is recommended. For detailed mapping, surgical planning, or complex cases, MRI is preferred [^111pQt4Z].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Operator dependence**: TVUS accuracy is highly dependent on operator expertise, which can lead to variability in results [^111pQt4Z].
- **False negatives**: Both TVUS and MRI can miss small or superficial lesions, particularly in the early stages of endometriosis [^117CEkk2].
- **Cost and accessibility**: MRI is more expensive and less accessible in some settings, limiting its routine use [^115d7CAR].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being explored to **enhance diagnostic accuracy** and reduce operator dependence in both TVUS and MRI [^113qsDGE]. Advanced MRI techniques, including **3D imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging**, are under investigation to improve detection and characterization of endometriotic lesions [^113Rf89L]. Hybrid imaging approaches combining TVUS and MRI may offer **comprehensive assessment and improved accuracy** in complex cases [^113qsDGE].

---

TVUS is the **best initial imaging modality** for controlling endometriosis due to its accuracy, availability, and cost-effectiveness [^1151w7Ab]. MRI is the **preferred second-line modality** for detailed mapping and surgical planning, especially in complex cases [^111Zdafi]. The choice of imaging should be individualized based on patient factors, clinical scenario, and resource availability [^117QH7t1].

Endometriosis is a chronic condition defined by endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, with symptoms including pain, infertility, and fatigue. Despite the high prevalence of disease, diagnosis is frequently delayed, in part due to reliance on invasive procedures such as laparoscopy. Over the past decade, scientific research and international collaborations have focused on the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools to allow earlier detection and reduce the burden of surgical diagnosis. This narrative review summarizes key developments in non-invasive tools over the past decade. These advances include those in the biomarker space, imaging techniques and protocols, and artificial intelligence applications. While no single test has yet replaced laparoscopy, significant strides have been made toward safer, earlier diagnosis. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization of imaging and research protocols, and large-scale validation studies are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice.

### Endometriosis: evaluation and treatment [^115vv2wu]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an inflammatory condition caused by the presence of endometrial tissue in extra-uterine locations and can involve bowel, bladder, and all peritoneal structures. It is one of the most common gynecologic disorders, affecting up to 10% of people of reproductive age. Presentation of endometriosis can vary widely, from infertility in asymptomatic people to debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and period-related gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. Diagnosis of endometriosis in the primary care setting is clinical and often challenging, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although transvaginal ultrasonography is used to evaluate endometriosis of deep pelvic sites to rule out other causes of pelvic pain, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred if deep infiltrating endometriosis is suspected. Laparoscopy with biopsy remains the definitive method for diagnosis, although several gynecologic organizations recommend empiric therapy without immediate surgical diagnosis. Combined hormonal contraceptives with or without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line options in managing symptoms and have a tolerable adverse effect profile. Second-line treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists with add-back therapy, GnRH receptor antagonists, and danazol. Aromatase inhibitors are reserved for severe disease. All of these treatments are effective but may cause additional adverse effects. Referral to gynecology for surgical management is indicated if empiric therapy is ineffective, immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary, or patients desire pregnancy. Alternative treatments have limited benefit in alleviating pain symptoms but may warrant further investigation.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^116SJhqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

Abstract

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition of unknown aetiology that primarily affects women of reproductive age. The accepted first-line imaging modality is pelvic ultrasound. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly performed as an additional investigation in complex cases and for surgical planning. There is currently no international consensus regarding patient preparation, MRI protocols or reporting criteria. Our aim was to develop clinical guidelines for MRI evaluation of pelvic endometriosis based on literature evidence and consensus expert opinion. This work was performed by a group of radiologists from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR), experts in gynaecological imaging and a gynaecologist expert in methodology. The group discussed indications for MRI, technical requirements, patient preparation, MRI protocols and criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis on MRI. The expert panel proposed a final recommendation for each criterion using Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 levels of evidence.

Key Points

- This report provides guidelines for MRI in endometriosis.

- Minimal and optimal MRI acquisition protocols are provided.

- Recommendations are proposed for patient preparation, best MRI sequences and reporting criteria.

### Noninvasive diagnostic imaging for endometriosis part 2: a systematic review of recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine and computed tomography [^115d7CAR]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, taking 6.4 years to diagnose using conventional laparoscopy. Non-invasive imaging enables timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay, risk and expense of surgery. This review updates literature exploring the diagnostic value of specialist endometriosis magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), nuclear medicine (NM) and computed tomography (CT). Searching after the 2016 IDEA consensus, 6192 publications were identified, with 27 studies focused on imaging for endometriosis. eMRI was the subject of 14 papers, NM and CT, 11, and artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing eMRI, 2. eMRI papers describe diagnostic accuracy for endometriosis, methodologies, and innovations. Advantages of eMRI include its: ability to diagnose endometriosis in those unable to tolerate transvaginal endometriosis ultrasound (eTVUS); a panoramic pelvic view, easy translation to surgical fields; identification of hyperintense iron in endometriotic lesions; and ability to identify super-pelvic lesions. Sequence standardization means eMRI is less operator-dependent than eTVUS, but higher costs limit its role to a secondary diagnostic modality. eMRI for deep and ovarian endometriosis has sensitivities of 91–93.5% and specificities of 86–87.5% making it reliable for surgical mapping and diagnosis. Superficial lesions too small for detection in larger capture sequences, means a negative eMRI doesn't exclude endometriosis. Combined with thin sequence capture and improved reader expertise, eMRI is poised for rapid adoption into clinical practice. NM labeling is diagnostically limited in absence of suitable unique marker for endometrial-like tissue. CT studies expose the reproductively aged to radiation. AI diagnostic tools, combining independent eMRI and eTVUS endometriosis markers, may result in powerful capability. Broader eMRI use, will optimize standards and protocols. Reporting systems correlating to surgical anatomy will facilitate interdisciplinary preoperative dialogues. eMRI endometriosis diagnosis should reduce repeat surgeries with mental and physical health benefits for patients. There is potential for early eMRI diagnoses to prevent chronic pain syndromes and protect fertility outcomes.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial cells develop outside the uterine cavity, causing pelvic pain. The most common sites of involvement are ovaries, tubes, and pelvic peritoneum. It is mainly a young women's disease (mean age 25–29 years), but it can also be seen in adolescents as well as older women but rarely in the post-menopausal state.

Endometriosis infiltrates the pelvic peritoneum in three ways: superficial or non-invasive (less than 5 mm depth), ovarian or cystic (endometriomas), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) which is specified by more than 5 mm of invasion. The invasion can lead to fibrosis, adhesion, and ultimately the obliteration of the relevant anatomic part.

Laparoscopy has long been accepted as the main modality to diagnose endometriosis, although it suffers from associated risks, limitations, and costs. One of the serious drawbacks of laparoscopy is the risk of missing cul-de-sac DIE which is unfortunately among the most prevalent involvement sites. MRI, on the other hand, can quickly diagnose and detect DIE in a variety of locations. Furthermore, normal anatomy which is usually distorted in DIE can be better distinguished due to the multi-planar capability of this modality. MRI is extremely efficient in evaluating ovarian endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis; in contrast, the superficial types and loci which are difficult to be evaluated by MRI are usually non-symptomatic ones.

MRI can be used in diagnosis (presence of disease) and evaluating the extension of disease (normal versus abnormal anatomy) as well as its detailed mapping. Considering its multi-focal capabilities, MRI can simultaneously evaluate different regions of the pelvic cavity for endometriosis, a multi-organ disease. As a result, it may be the ideal imaging modality for determining the operation roadmap, particularly in complicated cases involving many organs and requiring a multi-specialty procedure. In the case of imprecise imaging and mapping, the right treatment and surgery could not be done.

Several research have demonstrated the efficacy of MRI in evaluating patients suspected of endometriosis, although detailed statistics are either absent or the datasets for epidemiological studies are small (less than 400 cases). A collection of several studies has been reviewed in a comprehensive study to evaluate the accuracy of MRI in combined 1819 cases. A statistical survey is especially important to identify rare and isolated regions of involvement that can result in a debilitating unknown source of pain for women which can be under-diagnosed.

### MRI technique for the preoperative evaluation of deep infiltrating endometriosis: current status and protocol recommendation [^1114aXBo]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility. It is defined as the occurrence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and can manifest as a peritoneal, ovarian or infiltrating form, the latter being referred to as deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Surgery is essential in the treatment of DIE and depending on the severity of the disease, surgery can be difficult and extensive. Beside clinical examination and ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven its value to provide useful information for planning surgery in patients with suspected DIE. To optimise the quality of MRI examinations, radiologists have to be familiar with the capabilities and also the limitations of this technique with respect to the assessment of DIE. MRI yields morphological information by using mainly T1- and T2-weighted sequences, but can also provide functional information by means of intravenous gadolinium, diffusion-weighted imaging or cine-MRI. In this article, these techniques and also adequate measures of patient preparation, which are indispensable for successful MRI imaging for the preoperative evaluation of DIE, are reviewed and a comprehensive protocol recommendation is provided.

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T2-hypointense lesions [^11775wV9]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the diagnosis of deep pelvic infiltrating endometriosis requires careful consideration of a wide range of differential diagnosis on MRI. It is important to be aware of both pathological and non-pathological conditions that can mimic endometriosis. Among these, injection of gadolinium may be useful to reach precise diagnosis, but must remain justified, as systematic injection is not recommended. While endometriosis is prevalent, it is crucial to appropriately communicate and consider alternative diagnosis. Incorrect diagnosis can result in unnecessary medical and surgical interventions that may have long-term consequences. It is vital to understand the strengths and limitations of MRI in diagnosing endometriosis to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment decisions.

### Comparison of enhanced laparoscopic imaging techniques in endometriosis surgery: a diagnostic accuracy study [^1155rem9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis, characterized by endometrial deposits in the peritoneal cavity, is a benign but chronic and potentially harmful disorder associated with pelvic pain complaints, subfertility, and/or pelvic organ dysfunction. Although endometriosis can be suspected on presenting symptoms, physical examination and imaging [e.g. transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], laparoscopic identification, and histological verification of endometriotic tissue remain the gold standard for the final diagnosis of the disease. Treatment of symptomatic endometriosis, especially when not responding to hormonal treatment, consists of laparoscopic excision or ablation of endometriotic tissue. However, the identification of endometriotic tissue during laparoscopy is not always clear which may partly contribute to the high rates of recurrence reported after surgical treatment (40–50% at 5 years). The polymorphic appearance of endometriotic lesions is supposed to be the origin of this impaired visual diagnosis during laparoscopy, especially non-pigmented endometriotic lesions which are hard to distinguish from healthy peritoneal tissue. Previous studies reported a positive predictive value of 2D white-light laparoscopy of only 66%. Therefore, complete resection of endometriosis is difficult and re-operation, due to symptomatic recurrence, occurs in more than 50% of the patients. The high costs of re-operation and the associated morbidity emphasize the importance of a more complete resection during primary surgery.

Enhanced laparoscopic imaging techniques, already frequently used in other fields of surgery, are promising additives to the intra-operative detection of endometriosis. These techniques visualize differences in (neo)vascularization and epithelial thickness, possibly enabling an improved detection of endometriosis. Previous studies showed that with the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence (5-ALA), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), and narrow-band imaging (NBI), endometriotic lesions were detected with a better sensitivity and equal specificity compared to 2D white-light imaging. Moreover, with these techniques additional endometriotic lesions were found that were not visualized with 2D white-light imaging only. The 5-ALA technique was, however, difficult to implement due to high costs and patient side effects, such as postoperative photosensitivity. NBI has shown to be a more feasible technique available in most laparoscopic platforms and without any side effects. The effectiveness for the detection of peritoneal endometriosis of more recently introduced laparoscopic imaging techniques, such as indocyanine green near-infrared imaging (ICG-NIR) or three-dimensional laparoscopy (3D), has not yet been investigated.

### A new validated screening method for endometriosis diagnosis based on patient questionnaires [^117EPUEG]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, is responsible for pain and infertility, and it hence has a major impact on quality of life. Endometriosis is a heterogeneous, chronic disease with a systemic impact, with three clinical phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Throughout the world, and irrespective of the health care system, the delay between the onset of symptoms and endometriosis diagnosis is between 6 and 10 years. This delay has major consequences not only for the patient (infertility, decrease of the ovarian reserve, major complications [intestinal occlusion, loss of a kidney, etc.], sexuality, relationship with their partner, fatigue, depression, central sensitization with consequences at the brain and/or peripheral levels, degradation of the patient-practitioner relationship, etc.) but also for society as a whole (loss of work productivity and a substantial economic burden). Initially considered mainly in terms of its impact on the afflicted individuals, endometriosis is increasingly recognized as a major public healthcare and societal problem, with a prevalence of approximately 10% of the female population.

These reasons warrant revisiting endometriosis diagnostic modalities. The "revolution" in the way endometriosis is diagnosed was made possible by the substantial improvements in gynecological imaging in recent years. Indeed, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used nowadays to diagnose endometriosis, to establish its phenotype (OMA and DIE), to determine the exact localizations of the lesions, as well as to assess the association with adenomyosiswith excellent predictive performance. This is the reason why several gynecological scientific societies are in agreement that patients who are experiencing pain from endometriosis and who do not have an immediate desire for pregnancy can be prescribed hormonal therapy without histological proof of endometriosis.,

However, referring all patients suspected of having endometriosis to specialized radiologists is not feasible. An initial screening to select the patients at higher risk of the disease is needed. A patient questionnaire is the first step in the diagnostic process. When properly conducted, it is sufficient to detect patients at high risk of endometriosis who should be referred to a specialized radiologist who is aware of the specific imaging modalities for the disease.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to devise and validate a score based solely on a patient questionnaire to select a sample of patients with a high prevalence of endometriosis using cut-off points with high specificity and sensitivity.

### Best practices: ultrasound versus MRI in the assessment of pelvic endometriosis [^116yNWDM]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common yet morbid disease. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment planning. Both ultrasound (US) and MRI are used to detect disease. We performed a literature review to assess whether one is superior. A total of 33 studies from the 4482 identified in the initial search were found to assess the efficacy of US and/or MRI in detecting pelvic endometriosis. Most studies were performed at centers with extensive experience with endometriosis, using dedicated US and MRI protocols. A wide range of sensitivities and specificities were reported, but overall weighted means of diagnostic statistics for US and MRI were similar. The choice of dedicated US versus dedicated MRI in the evaluation of endometriosis should therefore be based on the expertise in the region. The data also showed US had better accuracy than MRI for identifying the depth of wall invasion in bowel-wall disease, whereas MRI better depicted pelvic-wall and extraperitoneal disease than US. Routine US and MRI protocols performed worse than dedicated US and MRI protocols, which may account for delays in diagnoses. Clinical and research efforts directed at improving the sensitivity of routine imaging for diagnosing deep endometriosis could improve patient access to appropriate care.

Management of deep endometriosis: current concepts

Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that may manifest with three clinical patterns with increasing severity. Superficial peritoneal lesions are characterized by superficial implants of the pelvic peritoneum; ovarian endometriomas (OMA) are hemorrhagic cysts arising from ectopic endometrial tissue growing within the ovaries and less frequently outside the ovaries; and DIE leads to the most severe clinical pattern and is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, thus leading to local inflammation and consequently to fibrosis and muscular hyperplasia. DIE is usually found as a multifocal disease simultaneously involving multiple pelvic sites such as the Douglas pouch, the utero-sacral ligaments (USL), pelvic nerves, the rectum, the bladder, and the ureters (Table 1). The pathophysiology of such lesions is widely unknown; the type of lesion may vary over the life course, with no evidence supporting an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions. Similarly, the heterogeneity of symptoms is high. Women with endometriosis may experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, constipation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility; however, a clear characterization of the pain types and topologies of implants is lacking. Consequently, some women with minimal disease may report severe pelvic pain and infertility, whereas others with diffuse pelvic lesions can be almost asymptomatic. The heterogeneity of the disease and the uncertainties about its pathogenesis make its diagnosis challenging. For decades, laparoscopic visualization with histologic verification of lesions was considered the golden standard for diagnosis. However, laparoscopy, even if diagnostic, is not a risk-free surgery. Furthermore, deep infiltrating endometriosis may not be clearly seen in some cases during diagnosis laparoscopy. In fact, the diagnosis of adenomyosis and deep endometriosis involving retroperitoneal structures, particularly ureters and nerve roots, is extremely challenging, particularly when performed by non-experienced gynecologists. False negative procedures may result, thus significantly delaying the start of appropriate management and potentially leading to major complications. Symptoms and clinical findings of endometriosis can result in clinical diagnoses that may be strongly supported by imaging techniques even without histological confirmation. Transvaginal ultrasound, because of its non-invasiveness, dynamicity, ease of use, availability, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility, is currently considered by many endometriosis experts as the best first-line method for assessment of DIE. A systematic sonographic approach as defined by International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus was shown to improve detection rates of pelvic lesions. MRI is also considered a highly accurate imaging modality in the evaluation of DIE, particularly when involvement of the rectum, ureters and nerve roots is suspected; these areas are highly important for both the patient and the surgeon and may be poorly visualized even with laparoscopy. MRI is also increasingly used to assess the anatomic response to medical or surgical treatment and to differentiate endometriosis from adenomyosis; the latter is a specific and heterogeneous disease contributing, independently of endometriosis to symptoms, defined as the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium occurring in different forms (diffuse, focal, cystic or superficial). Adenomyosis may exist on its own but in about 30% of cases it is associated with DIE. The shift toward clinical and imaging-based diagnosis shortens the time between the first consultation and the final diagnosis, but the use of non-invasive methods requires a rigorous approach to ensure meaningful and consistent results.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^113JK8Eh]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose an update of ESUR endometriosis guidelines to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications.

Methods

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. Following literature research, a survey was delivered to 20 experts in gynecological imaging from 10 countries. Two rounds of surveys were conducted to obtain a consensus according to a Delphi process method. In this article, the results regarding MR indication, the use of standardized reports, and classifications are presented RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended when transvaginal ultrasonography is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient, before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist. ESUR panelists consider the roles of an MR classification: to improve communication between radiologist and surgeon (100%, 20/20) and between the radiologist and the patient (45%, 9/20), to predict operating time if surgery is planned (70%, 14/20), to predict the length of hospital stay after surgery (40%, 8/20), and to predict postoperative complications (70%, 14/20). ESUR panelists strongly agree that using an MR classification is useful (19/20, 95%), especially the radiological score, deep-pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI). Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) used or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients.

Conclusion

Standardized MR reporting is crucial and should include the use of MR classification. Drawings are considered an option, knowing that communication with the patient and surgeon is of paramount importance.

Key Points

Question ESUR's endometriosis guidelines were last published in 2017; an update is provided to reflect advances in MRI indications, reporting, and classifications. Findings MRI is advised for inconclusive/negative transvaginal ultrasound in symptomatic patients, before surgery, or post-treatment if symptoms persist. A structured report enhances communication with surgeons and patients. Clinical relevance A standardized report based on a compartmental analysis of the location of endometriotic nodules, with optional drawings, is essential for comprehensive mapping and optimal communication with both patient and surgeon.

### O-RADS MRI after initial ultrasound for adnexal lesions: expert panel narrative review [^116djLAc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound (US) and MRI risk stratification systems were developed by an international group of experts in adnexal imaging to aid radiologists in assessing adnexal lesions. The goal of imaging is to appropriately triage patients with adnexal lesions. US is the first-line imaging modality for assessment, whereas MRI can be used as a problem-solving tool. Both US and MRI can accurately characterize benign lesions such as simple cysts, endometriomas, hemorrhagic cysts, and dermoid cysts, avoiding unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. In patients with a lesion that does not meet criteria for one of these benign diagnoses, MRI can further characterize the lesion with an improved specificity for cancer and the ability to provide a probable histologic subtype in the presence of certain MRI features. This allows personalized treatment, including avoiding overly extensive surgery or allowing fertility-sparing procedures for suspected benign, borderline, or low-grade tumors. When MRI findings indicate a risk of an invasive cancer, patients can be expeditiously referred to a gynecologic oncologic surgeon. This narrative review provides expert opinion on the utility of multiparametric MRI when using the O-RADS US and MRI management systems.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^112KqGHb]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Expert panel members

The panel included 20 experts from 10 different countries, including 14 European centers and one non-European institution (Italy (n = 5), France (n = 4), Austria (n = 2), Portugal (n = 2), United Kingdom (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), Turkey (n = 1), Switzerland (n = 1) and Brazil (n = 1)). Ninety percent of panelists (18/20) were affiliated with referral centers for endometriosis with a high volume of dedicated TVUS (> 30 TVUS per month; 80%, 16/20). In half of these centers, the radiologists themselves conduct the ultrasound examinations. Regarding MR practice, more than 30 exams are acquired monthly in 50% of centers. Additionally, 50% of panelists (10/20) regularly participate in multidisciplinary meetings dedicated to endometriosis.

Delphi process

The ESUR Research Committee appointed two chairs (I.T.N. L.M.) to supervise the development of the updated guidelines. The updating process comprised the following steps:

Step 1 — Literature search: Four authors (I.T.N. L.M. M.D. and P.R.) performed a literature review of new data covering the time frame between 2017 and 2023 by searching PubMed/Medline database, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for original articles in the English language on human subjects, including the following keywords: "endometriosis" AND "MRI" OR "Magnetic Resonance".

Step 2 — Panel selection: The chairpersons selected 20 ESUR Female Pelvic Imaging Working Group (FPI-ESUR) members based on their competence in the field; the criteria for inclusion in the group were radiologists with at least five years of experience in endometriosis imaging and who had produced relevant indexed and peer-reviewed publications.

### Pelvic nerve endometriosis: MRI features and key findings for surgical decision [^114tJtPo]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pelvic nerve involvement in endometriosis is a condition often underestimated by practitioners and underreported by radiologists. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible nerve damage. MRI is the optimal imaging modality to accurately assess the distribution and the extent of pelvic nerve involvement in endometriosis. Recognizing the key features of MRI is essential for radiologists to provide structured reports to assist in selecting the best therapeutic approach and patient counseling.

### Gynecologic ultrasound [^115yhmAA]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

For most women, pelvic sonography using a transvaginal probe is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the uterus and adnexae. It is reliable for detecting ovarian cysts and other adnexal masses, and it can often determine if a lesion can be observed on serial examinations or if it requires more urgent attention. Uterine ultrasound is reliable for evaluating both the normal and abnormal endometrium and myometrium. In cases that are technically limited, or in those that are difficult to interpret, a tailored MR imaging examination often can be helpful.

### Postoperative imaging of endometriosis [^111KLk1E]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a highly prevalent disease that affects 10%-15% of women of reproductive age worldwide and is mainly associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. With the widespread use of imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring of endometriosis, combined with the ability of surgery to eradicate the disease and address infertility, there has been a significant increase in recent years in imaging examinations for postoperative evaluation of endometriosis. US and MRI are used not only to help diagnose and map endometriosis but also to evaluate refractory symptoms, residual lesions, and complications at posttreatment assessment. Knowledge of surgical techniques and recognition of expected postoperative imaging findings are crucial to differentiate postoperative changes from residual disease and/or recurrence. The authors discuss imaging aspects of postoperative endometriosis, with an emphasis on the imaging approach, comprehension of surgical techniques, recognition of the expected findings, possible complications, and analysis of residual disease or recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Continued improvement to imaging diagnosis and treatment triage of endometriosis: the role of the multi-disciplinary conference [^114xFyGr]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-centered endometriosis management tailored to the individual patient's subset of symptoms often requires highly sensitive and specific preoperative imaging. In the setting of a present ongoing learning curve among radiologists who interpret pelvis ultrasounds and MRIs for diagnosis of endometriosis, we have found that routine feedback between minimally invasive gynecology surgeons and radiologists, based on pre-operative imaging and postoperative laparoscopic findings, is essential for the continual improvement of imaging-based staging of endometriosis and empower pre-operative imaging as an important pillar of endometriosis management. We share illustrative patient cases, which, after collaborative discussion during our routine multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary conferences (MDCs) have led to improved patient counseling, better pre-surgical planning, and therefore improved patient satisfaction. Our endometriosis MDCs will continue to improve patient management in the future by providing a forum for trainees in medical, surgical, imaging, and pathology specialties to gain expertise directly from subspecialists, and participate in the care of these patients.

### Endometriosis: evaluation and treatment | AAFP… [^11225YXw]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

16 However, a normal physical examination does not rule out endometriosis. 20 The definitive method of diagnosing endometriosis is considered to be laparoscopy with biopsy, which allows histologic confirmation of suspicious lesions. 21 However, many societies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, endorse the treatment of symptoms before obtaining a definitive diagnosis from surgery. 22 There has been a paradigm shift away from surgical diagnosis to clinical diagnosis with technologic advancements in imaging to prevent delays in treatment. 23, 24. LABORATORY STUDIES AND IMAGING Transvaginal ultrasonography is recommended as the initial imaging approach in patients with suspected endometriosis because it is widely available. 25, 26 Standard TVUS has demonstrated a specificity greater than 85% for all deep pelvic endometriosis sites, with sensitivity ranging between 50% and 84%.

TVUS guided by bladder site tenderness — a modified technique in which particular attention is paid to tender points experienced by patients under gentle pressure of the ultrasound probe when specifically evaluating the bladder — had a sensitivity and specificity of 97. 4%. 26 If there is concern for deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter, then magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis, typically without contrast media depending on the clinical scenario, is preferred, although it does have a higher cost than TVUS. 21, 22, 25. Surgical excision of endometriotic tissue for treatment of pain was thought to be effective. However, based on limited evidence, an updated Cochrane review reported uncertainty about whether laparoscopic surgery improves endometriosis pain at six and 12 months compared with diagnostic laparoscopy alone.

Management of Infertility Infertility is likely related to inflammation and damage to fallopian tubes and ovaries from scar tissue. 50 Patients with infertility do not benefit from diagnostic laparoscopy any more than patients with other symptoms of endometriosis, 44 although once infertility has been established and the patient desires pregnancy, laparoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for minimal to mild disease. In those with mild disease, laparoscopic surgery may improve spontaneous pregnancy and live birth rates compared with expectant management.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^115f4cZQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting women during the reproductive lifespan. Diagnosis of endometriosis must take into account clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests and different imaging techniques. Since pelvic anatomy is complex and may vary with distortion by invasive endometriosis, the radiologist must be aware of both normal and deranged anatomy.

The ideal purpose of surgery is a therapeutic and effective intervention based on a careful preoperative evaluation. From this point of view, the role of MR imaging to help diagnose and plan surgical strategy is critical in the management of the disease. Preoperative detection of all endometriotic lesions is recommended to choose the surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work. This multidisciplinary approach including radiologists, gynaecologists, urologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, and (in selected cases) neurosurgeons, is recommended to improve diagnostic imaging accuracy and patients' outcome, and to reduce postoperative complication rates. The recent awareness that endometriosis may be medically treated based on strong clinical suspicion and that laparoscopy should be intended for surgical treatment, not for diagnostic purposes, furtherly enhance the role of non-invasive diagnostic procedures and particularly of MR imaging.

In any case, due to the complexity of the disease, it is appropriate to centralize the overall care of endometriosis patients to reference centres in order to pursue a patient-centred approach tailored to the patient's specific condition and desires.

### A review of more than 2000 cases of site-specific pelvic endometriosis rates by MRI: a guide to minimizing under / overdiagnosis non-invasively [^117DMjKi]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For a large dataset based on MR imaging, the prevalence of endometrioma and DIE involvement in various pelvic compartments, as well as their statistical correlation, were assessed. Knowing the likelihood of various sections being involved as well as their co-existence is a key step in accurately diagnosing and treating endometriosis. Pretreatment DIE mapping is essential for determining the type of treatment and ensuring thorough removal, especially if a multi-specialty operation is required. Furthermore, it aids in diagnosis and prevents under- or over-diagnosis.

### Predictive value of ultrasound imaging for diagnosis and surgery of deep endometriosis: a systematic review [^113JiGjY]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To calculate the predictive value and thus the clinical usefulness of transvaginal ultrasound (US) imaging for the management of deep endometriosis, knowing that the positive predictive value (PPV) varies with the prevalence and probably with the volume and location of the disease.

Data Sources

After registration on PROSPERO (CRD42022366323), PubMed was searched for all reports describing the diagnostic accuracy of US imaging for deep endometriosis published between January 1, 2000, and October 20, 2022.

Methods Of Study Selection

The 536 articles on "endometriosis AND US And diagnosis" were hand searched, and 30 reports describing sensitivity and specificity of deep endometriosis were found. Besides sensitivity and specificity, the prevalence, localization, and size of deep endometriosis lesions were collected.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Prevalences of deep endometriosis were reported only twice as 12% and 32% by ultrasonographers. In women undergoing surgery, prevalences vary between 40% and 100% because of the variable inclusion criteria. Specificity is higher than sensitivity for all locations: rectovaginal (97% [86–100] vs 74% [31–95], p = .0002), rectosigmoid (97% [63–100] vs 88% [37–97], p = .0082), vesicouterine (100% [97–100] vs 63% [22–100], p = .0021), and uterosacrals (91% [77–99] vs 68% [18–83], p = .0005). Notwithstanding improved equipment, accuracy did not vary over the last 20 years. Sensitivities or specificities have not been stratified by the size of the lesion, and thus, the lower detection limits are not known. In the absence of blinding, the usefulness for surgery could not be established.

Conclusion

The reported sensitivities and specificities of transvaginal US are not only those of imaging but include symptoms and clinical examinations. In referral centers, the reported PPVs are high (94%-100%) given that prevalences are > 10% and specificities are > 95%. However, the extrapolation of the clinical use before surgical interventions should be considered with care, given that PPVs for smaller lesions and the lower detection limit are unknown and surgeons were not blinded to US results.

### Transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis [^1135gW8F]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Deeply infiltrating endometriosis is the clinical form of the disease that is generally associated with conditions of more intense pain and may require more complex surgical management, consequently resulting in greater risks to the patient. In recent years, various investigators have confirmed the usefulness of methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transrectal ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for the diagnosis of deep endometriotic lesions. The objectives of the present study are to describe the method used to perform TVUS for the detection of deeply infiltrating endometriosis, and to discuss the clinical benefits that the data obtained may offer clinicians providing care for patients suspected of having this type of endometriosis.

### Optimizing endometriosis diagnosis and mapping: the important role of advanced transvaginal ultrasound [^1139eaw8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is estimated to affect 5%-10% of women of reproductive age, making timely diagnosis essential for initiating treatment, alleviating symptoms, and reducing the risk of disease progression. Unfortunately, the diagnostic delay in this disease is estimated to be approximately 10years. The aim of this study is to present a case series of three patients assessed with both imaging modalities for endometriosis diagnosis and mapping, advanced transvaginal ultrasound (ATVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The findings obtained by performing the ATVUS imaging study protocol with different pelvic compartments according to the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus are described and contrasted with those for MRI, along with their correlation to surgical and histological findings. A single gynecologist with specialized training in ATVUS performed a systematic pelvic evaluation in patients with clinical suspicion of endometriosis. The physician performed the anatomo-sonographic assessments described by the IDEA consensus. A retrospective analysis of the three cases was performed comparing both imaging modalities and surgical and histological findings. It was demonstrated in this case series that endometriosis is detectable in distinct pelvic compartments by ATVUS, with results comparable to MRI, while offering the benefits of lower cost and widespread accessibility. In contrast, individuals, insurance companies, and healthcare systems in some countries might be unable or unwilling to cover MRI costs for endometriosis diagnosis or presurgical mapping. In conclusion, given the high prevalence of endometriosis, mastering ATVUS is essential. Future studies should aim to robustly evaluate the role of ATVUS alongside other imaging modalities, including MRI, to maximize diagnostic accuracy.

### Nonsurgical approaches to the diagnosis and evaluation of endometriosis [^114Yytdm]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

An inability to make the diagnosis of endometriosis or evaluate lesion response to treatment without surgery is a clear impediment to understanding the disease and to developing new therapies. The need is particularly strong for rASRM Stage 1 or 2 disease, since higher stage (rASRM Stage 3 or 4) endometriosis can often be diagnosed by ultrasound or other imaging techniques. Despite promising findings in association studies, no biomarkers or nonsurgical diagnostic or evaluation methods for Stage 1 or Stage 2 endometriosis has yet been clinically validated. Admittedly, validation is difficult, since surgery is required as a gold standard diagnostic method for comparison. This manuscript is aimed as a succinct review of what is known about nonsurgical approaches to detect and assess endometriosis, with an emphasis on Stage 1 and 2.

### European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines: MR imaging of pelvic endometriosis [^111eBzSw]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

MRI protocols for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis were collected from one non-European and seven European institutions. Inclusion criteria to participate in the guideline development process were: to be a member of the FPI-ESUR working group, and to perform regular MRI examinations and/or publications related to endometriosis. All but one investigators included in this guidelines process were experts in gynaecological imaging, the last being a gynaecologist expert in methodology.

A questionnaire was established containing the following information: patient preparation, magnet field strength, type of coil, type of MRI sequences, use of intravenous contrast injection, and vaginal and/or rectal opacification.

Published literature was reviewed through a Medline literature search of abstracts in the English language of studies in human subjects, including the following keywords: 'endometriosis' and 'MR imaging' up to June 2015. Articles that did not include technical details matching the information requested in the questionnaire were excluded. The details were entered into an Excel spread sheet and the results discussed and divided into topics with agreement and disagreement. Topics with disagreement were compared to the literature. Experts in favour of one technical option were asked to support their views using data from the literature. The expert panel proposed a final recommendation for each criterion using Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 levels of evidence

The summary of valid scientific data for each question analysed by the experts included a level of evidence (LE) based on the quality of available data and defined according to the rating scheme developed by the French National Authority for Health:
LE1: high-power randomized comparative trials or meta-analyses of randomized comparative trials;
LE2: low-power randomized trials, well-conducted non-randomized comparative studies and cohort studies;
LE3: non-consecutive studies or studies without consistently applied reference standards;
LE4: non-randomized comparative studies with substantial bias, retrospective studies, cross-sectional studies and case series.

The practice guidelines were summarised from the responses provided by the experts, and grades were attributed as follows: Grade A: established scientific evidence (LE1); Grade B: scientific presumption (LE2); Grade C: based on a low level of evidence (LE3 or LE4). Recommendations based on professional consensus were reduced to a minimum (Good Practice Point: GPP) and were used in the queries when literature was lacking in evidence.

### Noninvasive diagnostic imaging for endometriosis part 1: a systematic review of recent developments in ultrasound, combination imaging, and artificial intelligence [^113qsDGE]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women and those assigned female at birth. However, it takes 6.4 years to diagnose using the conventional standard of laparoscopy. Noninvasive imaging enables a timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay as well as the risk and expense of surgery. This review updates the exponentially increasing literature exploring the diagnostic value of endometriosis specialist transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS), combinations of eTVUS and specialist magnetic resonance imaging, and artificial intelligence. Concentrating on literature that emerged after the publication of the IDEA consensus in 2016, we identified 6192 publications and reviewed 49 studies focused on diagnosing endometriosis using emerging imaging techniques. The diagnostic performance of eTVUS continues to improve but there are still limitations. eTVUS reliably detects ovarian endometriomas, shows high specificity for deep endometriosis and should be considered diagnostic. However, a negative scan cannot preclude endometriosis as eTVUS shows moderate sensitivity scores for deep endometriosis, with the sonographic evaluation of superficial endometriosis still in its infancy. The fast-growing area of artificial intelligence in endometriosis detection is still evolving, but shows great promise, particularly in the area of combined multimodal techniques. We finalize our commentary by exploring the implications of practice change for surgeons, sonographers, radiologists, and fertility specialists. Direct benefits for endometriosis patients include reduced diagnostic delay, better access to targeted therapeutics, higher quality operative procedures, and improved fertility treatment plans.

### European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines: MR imaging of pelvic endometriosis [^111pQt4Z]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that is defined as functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. This disease affects women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of approximately 10%. Patients can be asymptomatic or present with chronic pelvic pain and/or infertility. The combination of laparoscopy and histological verification of endometrial glands and/or stroma is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of the disease.

Ultrasonography (US) is the first-line imaging modality for the assessment of pelvic endometriosis but has limitations with respect to field-of-view and operator dependence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed as an additional examination in complex cases or prior to surgery and is highly accurate in the evaluation of endometriosis. However, there is no international consensus on patient preparation, best MRI sequences or reporting criteria.

The aim of this work was to develop guidelines for optimal MRI protocols and image interpretation in endometriosis based on a detailed literature review and consensus expert opinion from the Female Pelvic Imaging working group of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (FPI-ESUR).

### Pelvic MRI staging of endometriosis at 3 T without patient preparation or anti-peristaltic: diagnostic performance outcomes [^115ZSUhk]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Endometriosis is a disease of significant burden among pre-menopausal women characterised by the appearance of functional endometrial tissue in locations outside the uterus. Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is an invasion of the endometriotic lesion that exceeds 5 mm in depth into the peritoneum. In most cases, pelvic MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the pre-operative workup for DIE to guide surgery. The recommended standard for pelvic MRI images is at 1.5 T with patient preparations in the form of laxatives, anti-spasmodics and/or rectal contrast. However, there appears to be equally diagnostic quality imaging obtainable with a 3 T system using fast imaging acquisition without any patient preparation. This reduces imaging time, movement artefacts, is more comfortable for the patient and is easier for workflow coordination. This study aims to confirm that this approach reaches diagnostic performance outcomes comparable to reported international standards, particularly in the detection of endometriotic bowel lesions, in order to guide surgical pre-operative planning.

Methods and Materials

Pre-operative diagnostic radiology reports were identified by a search of the Radiology Information System (RIS) for all pelvic MRI studies performed at a tertiary referral centre, King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, between January 2015 to April 2017 that contained the keyword "endometriosis". Reported sites of endometriotic deposits at MRI findings were tallied based on anatomical location and correlated to laparoscopic surgical report findings and/or pathology report as a reference standard. Pooled sensitivities and specificities were then calculated and compared with established studies.

Results

Ninety-eight MRI studies were identified, of which 76 identified DIE and 22 were normal studies. Sixty-one patients did not have a surgical or pathology record. Of the remainder who underwent laparoscopy, operative and/or pathology reports were obtainable in 37 female patients, with a median age of 35 years (range: 24 to 49 years). The average time interval from MRI report to surgical operation was 195 days (range: 5 to 563 days). Middle compartment estimated sensitivity was 79.4% (95% CI = (69.4%, 89.4%)), specificity 95.1% (95% CI = (91.2%, 98.9%)). Posterior compartment estimated sensitivity was 76.5% (95% CI = (66.4%, 86.6%)), specificity 99.4% (95% CI = (98.1%, 100%)). Overall sensitivity 76.9% (95% CI = (69.7%, 84.0%)), specificity 98.5% (95% CI = (97.3%, 99.6%)). Sensitivity and specificity of detecting bowel endometriosis were estimated to be 94.4% (95% CI = (83.9%, 100%) and 94.7% (84.7%, 100%)) respectively.

Conclusion

Using a 3 T MRI system without patient preparation is feasible and achieves benchmark diagnostic performance outcomes in the pre-operative assessment for DIE, especially in detecting posterior compartment lesions and bowel DIE to correctly guide surgical planning.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: protocol, lexicon, and compartment-based analysis [^113Rf89L]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis, defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, affects 2–10% of the female population, representing at least 190 million women worldwide. In addition, endometriosis is reported in 50% of women of reproductive age with chronic pelvic pain and or with a history of infertility, but this includes predominantly superficial endometriosis, which is often overlooked or not seen on imaging. In contrast, adnexal endometriosis and deep pelvic endometriosis (DE) have a more aggressive behavior in some women with endometriosis.

In 2017, the first European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) consensus proposed some recommendations regarding patient preparation and imaging acquisition to start standardizing practice. However, the MRI technique has improved with high-resolution 3D sequences and AI denoising solutions, necessitating a review of protocol guidelines.

Since the previous consensus, several authors have proposed a consensual lexicon and developed different reporting classifications to improve communication between the radiologist and the patient or the radiologist and the surgeon. This is why it is time to change imaging guidelines in endometriosis.

### Pelvic nerve endometriosis: MRI features and key findings for surgical decision [^1177vqxD]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecological disorder in women of reproductive age. It is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain. While the mechanisms underlying this pain remain elusive, rare cases of pelvic nerve involvement can result in severe, debilitating symptoms, adding complexity to the clinical landscape. Nerve involvement typically results from the direct extension of deep infiltrating endometriosis, though it may also occur in isolation. The nerves most commonly affected include the inferior hypogastric and lumbosacral plexuses, as well as the sciatic, pudendal, obturator, and femoral nerves. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for the effective management of the pain and the prevention of irreversible nerve damage. Given the limitations of transvaginal ultrasonography in visualizing the lateral compartment, MRI is considered the gold standard for detecting and evaluating pelvic nerve involvement. Through the use of optimized protocols to enhance the visualization of nerves and their anatomical landmarks, radiologists play a key role in the identification of endometriotic lesions. A comprehensive and structured radiology report is essential for surgical planning, as nerve involvement often requires precise interventions to alleviate symptoms and restore quality of life. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Accurate identification and a structured reporting of pelvic nerve endometriosis in the lateral compartment are pivotal to guide surgical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: Pelvic nerve endometriosis is often overlooked, underestimated by clinicians, and underdiagnosed on imaging. Timely nerve involvement diagnosis prevents permanent damage in pelvic pain with neurological symptoms. Deep endometriosis in the lateral compartment may extend to the pelvic nerves. The inferior hypogastric plexus, sacral plexus, sciatic, and pudendal nerves are commonly affected. A dedicated MRI protocol with 3D T2-weighted sequence ensures accurate pelvic nerve assessment.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^115jc6rB]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of standardized MR report

There is increasing evidence supporting the use of structured reporting in radiology. It is well-recognized that standardized reporting enhances communication between radiologists, referring physicians, and patients, while also benefiting research efforts. Structured reporting ensures that key features are less likely to be overlooked by radiologists and surgeons, provides greater clarity in findings, aids in patient counseling and management, and facilitates more accurate and appropriate data collection for scientific purposes. Additionally, structured reports improve the complementary practices between radiologists and gynecologic surgeons, with the potential to enhance surgical decision-making compared to routine reviews.

Detecting endometriosis during laparoscopy can be challenging due to the variable appearance of lesions, the presence of subtle retroperitoneal implants, and the inherent complexities of evaluating pelvic anatomy surgically. Surgeries can also be highly complex and carry significant morbidity, often necessitating multidisciplinary teams, including the assistance of colorectal surgeons and/or urologists. Consequently, a compartmentalized review of pelvic anatomy is seen as a key strength in enhancing diagnostic sensitivity. The significance of a comprehensive compartmental review of pelvic structures by radiologists is highlighted by its critical role in surgical planning. The ESUR expert group strongly agreed with using a structured report (17/20, 85%). Only 11/20 (55%) ESUR panelists admitted to using it in daily practice, but 6/20 answered they will in the future (see ESUR standardized report in the supplementary material).

Statement 3: ESUR panelists strongly agreed that a standardized MR report is recommended (Grade B).

### Sensitivity of narrow band imaging compared with white light imaging for the detection of endometriosis [^111EU6qP]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the ability of narrow band imaging (NBI) in conjunction with standard white light imaging to improve the detection and diagnosis of endometriosis during laparoscopic evaluation compared with white light imaging alone. Sensitivity of NBI in detecting endometriosis was assessed and compared with white light imaging.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Classification Of Study Design

LEVEL I: Evidence obtained from a properly designed, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

The trial was conducted in 2 medical centers.

Patients

One hundred sixty-seven women undergoing laparoscopic evaluation for suspected endometriosis and/or infertility were recruited. Of these, 150 were assessable to determine sensitivity of NBI compared with white light imaging for the detection of endometriotic lesions.

Interventions

Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive white light imaging followed by NBI or white light imaging only. The pelvis was systematically visualized with each assigned imaging modality; lesions were recorded under each visualization and then resected. All patients had white light imaging on the first visualization followed by either a second white light examination (control arm) or NBI examination (intervention arm).

Measurements

Pathology of resected lesions was the criterion standard for evaluating sensitivity and was conducted at each institution. The method of detection of the lesion (white light or NBI) was masked. Central pathology review was conducted for a randomly selected 10% sample of specimens and for those lesions visualized under only 1 imaging modality among patients assigned to the intervention arm. The sensitivity was assessed for each modality (white light and NBI) and compared using a McNemar's test.

Main Results

Among the group randomized to receive both white light and NBI, 4 patients had lesions detected with NBI but no lesions detected with white light. Among the 255 lesions confirmed as endometriosis by pathologic review, all were detected by NBI for a sensitivity of 100%; 79% were detected by white light imaging (p < .001).

Conclusion

The addition of NBI to white light imaging increased the number of endometriotic lesions identified during laparoscopy and the diagnosis of endometriosis compared with the use of white light imaging alone.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^111PvKPq]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic disease affecting about 10% of reproductive-age women with symptoms like pelvic pain and infertility. Pathologically, it is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity responsible for a chronic inflammatory process. For decades the diagnosis of endometriosis was based on surgical exploration and biopsy of pelvic lesions. However, laparoscopy is not a risk-free procedure with possible false negative diagnosis due to an underestimate of retroperitoneal structures such as ureters and nerves. For these reasons nowadays, the diagnosis of endometriosis is based on a noninvasive approach where clinical history, response to therapy and imaging play a fundamental role. Trans-vaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are suitable for recognizing most of endometriotic lesions; nevertheless, their accuracy is strictly determined by operators' experience and imaging technique. This review paper aims to make radiologists aware of the diagnostic possibilities of pelvic MRI and familial with the MR acquisition protocols and image interpretation for women with endometriosis.

### Combination of the non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of endometriosis [^112FryQL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis, a costly chronic disease causing pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, but is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, there are no non-invasive tests available in clinical practice to accurately diagnose endometriosis. This review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combinations of different non-invasive testing modalities for endometriosis and provided a summary of all the reviews in the non-invasive tests for endometriosis series.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of any combination of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal and/or ovarian or deep infiltrating) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. The combined tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and triage tests to assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We did not restrict the searches to particular study designs, language or publication dates. We searched CENTRAL to July 2015, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2015, as well as the following databases to April 2015: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, DARE and PubMed.

Selection Criteria

We considered published, peer-reviewed, randomised controlled or cross-sectional studies of any size, including prospectively collected samples from any population of women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: ovarian, peritoneal or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). We included studies comparing the diagnostic test accuracy of a combination of several testing modalities with the findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of the data from each study by using the QUADAS-2 tool. For each test, the data were classified as positive or negative for the surgical detection of endometriosis and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. The bivariate model was planned to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity whenever sufficient data were available. The predetermined criteria for a clinically useful test to replace diagnostic surgery were a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.79 to detect endometriosis. We set the criteria for triage tests at a sensitivity of 0.95 and above and a specificity of 0.50 and above, which 'rules out' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a negative test result (SnOUT test), or a sensitivity of 0.50 and above and a specificity of 0.95 and above, which 'rules in' the diagnosis with high accuracy if there is a positive result (SpIN test).

Main Results

Eleven eligible studies included 1339 participants. All the studies were of poor methodological quality. Seven studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, one study considered DIE and/or ovarian endometrioma, two studies differentiated endometrioma from other ovarian cysts and one study addressed mapping DIE at specific anatomical sites. Fifteen different diagnostic combinations were assessed, including blood, urinary or endometrial biomarkers, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and clinical history or examination. We did not pool estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as each study analysed independent combinations of the non-invasive tests. Tests that met the criteria for a replacement test were: a combination of serum IL-6 (cut-off > 15.4 pg/ml) and endometrial PGP 9.5 for pelvic endometriosis (sensitivity 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.00), specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80, 0.98) and the combination of vaginal examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for rectal endometriosis (sensitivity 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00)). Tests that met the criteria for SpIN triage tests for pelvic endometriosis were: 1. a multiplication of urine vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP) and serum CA-125 (cut-off > 2755) (sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.84), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00)) and 2. a combination of history (length of menses), serum CA-125 (cut-off > 35 U/ml) and endometrial leukocytes (sensitivity 0.61 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.69), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98)). For endometrioma, the following combinations qualified as SpIN test: 1. TVUS and either serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) or CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.91), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.00)); 2. TVUS and serum CA 19.9 (cut-off ≥ 12 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.70), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.0)); 3–4. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 20 U/ml or cut-off ≥ 25 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.85), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)); 5. TVUS and serum CA-125 (cut-off ≥ 35 U/ml) (sensitivity 0.52 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.71), specificity 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.00)). A combination of vaginal examination and TVUS reached the threshold for a SpIN test for obliterated pouch of Douglas (sensitivity 0.87 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96), specificity 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.00)), vaginal wall endometriosis (sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.95), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0)) and rectovaginal septum endometriosis (sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.00)). All the tests were evaluated in individual studies and displayed wide CIs. Due to the heterogeneity and high risk of bias of the included studies, the clinical utility of the studied combination diagnostic tests for endometriosis remains unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the biomarkers evaluated in this review could be evaluated in a meaningful way and there was insufficient or poor-quality evidence. Laparoscopy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis and using any non-invasive tests should only be undertaken in a research setting.

### Ultrasound techniques in the diagnosis of deep pelvic endometriosis: algorithm based on a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114G6u8P]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To collate all available evidence with respect to ultrasound techniques in the management of deep pelvic endometriosis (DPE) and compare the sensitivity and specificity of each to determine the most suitable site-specific method. We aim to provide clinicians with information to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with DPE.

Design

Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

None.

Interventions(S)

Review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

For each study we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and positive/negative likelihood ratio regarding DPE sites. We then compared the specificity and sensitivity of each technique. Forest plots with the corresponding 95% confidence interval using fixed/random effects for each approach (both separately and summarized according to the weight of any single study) were used.

Result(S)

A key word search strategy identified 441 manuscripts, 35 of which were eligible for the review (32 for meta-analysis). Standard transvaginal sonography (TVS) showed specificity greater than 85% for all DPE sites, despite sensitivity ranging between 50% (bladder, vaginal wall, and rectovaginal septum) and 84% (rectosigmoid). Modified techniques such as bladder site tenderness-guided TVS showed a value of 97.4% for both sensitivity and specificity. Rectal endoscopy-sonography and rectal water contrast TVS were both superior to TVS in detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis with sensitivities and specificities over 92%. Promising data were reported by using rectal water contrast TVS for rectovaginal septum disease (sensitivity, 97.1%; specificity, 99.3%).

Conclusion(S)

The summary of data regarding diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of TVS in women undergoing surgery for deep endometriosis may allow us to conclude that TVS should remain the first-line method in the evaluation of patients with suspicion of DPE. When TVS is insufficient, second-line "modified-techniques" should be considered. Choosing the most effective technique is a challenge and should be based on patient history and clinical signs/symptoms.

### Bowel endometriosis: systematic approach to diagnosis with US and MRI [^112iAcJZ]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis involving the bowel is a severe form of the disease, and the bowel is the most common site of extragenital endometriosis. Surface lesions of the bowel are considered peritoneal disease. Bowel endometriosis (BE) is defined as endometriotic tissue infiltrating the muscularis propria layer of the bowel wall. BE is estimated to affect up to 37% of patients with known deep endometriosis, highlighting its coexistence with genital endometriosis. The rectosigmoid colon is the most common segment of the bowel involved, followed by the distal small bowel. US and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to detect BE. Depending on which bowel segment is imaged, endometriosis protocols for transvaginal US after bowel preparation with a transabdominal component and MRI and MR enterography are most commonly used. The authors provide a systematic approach to the diagnosis of BE using these imaging modalities. Imaging protocols and techniques for optimization of visualization of the bowel are discussed, the normal bowel wall anatomy with both imaging modalities is described, and the varying degrees of bowel wall involvement in endometriosis are illustrated. The imaging features of infiltration of endometriosis in the bowel muscularis propria are described in detail, along with key imaging findings to be conveyed to surgical colleagues to optimize surgical treatment and decrease complications, thereby improving overall patient outcomes. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Detection of endometriosis lesions using Gd-based collagen I targeting probe in murine models of endometriosis [^115tJ55W]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy is the gold standard in endometriosis diagnosis which is normally followed by histological verification. However, since this procedure is invasive, and if there is no intention to remove lesions surgically, other non-invasive diagnostic methods in conjunction with physical examination and assessment of patient's medical history are preferable. Although developing non-invasive and low-invasive methods to diagnose endometriosis represents a challenge, the diagnostic potential of various genetic tests, biomarkers, and imaging techniques have also been evaluated. Imaging techniques that are currently used to diagnose endometriosis include sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound sonography is the first-line imaging modality in assessment of endometriosis. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds (TVUS) can give a more detailed image of the anatomy, compared to the initial ultrasonography of pelvis area. While TVUS is a readily available and inexpensive tool, it has limitation in detection of lesions, especially the ones located above the rectosigmoid junction and on the peritoneum. Also, its performance is heavily operator dependent, which presents a significant limitation for precise diagnosis. Despite being more expensive, MRI can be used when ultrasound results are unclear and high spatial resolution is needed. Despite dedicated MRI protocols which include both T1 and T2-weighted sequences, this modality can easily overlook solid masses of endometriotic tissue due to their small and atypical signal character. Due to limitations presented by ultrasound and MRI, patients with negative imaging results must still be subjected to laparoscopy to obtain a definite diagnosis. Developing targeted contrast agents for MRI can increase the signal difference between the lesions and surrounding tissues, especially for detection of non-pigmented lesions without intrinsic T1 hyperintense signal. Despite several published studies describing the development of targeted contrast agents for imaging of endometriosis, as of today, no clinically approved agents are available. Availability of such agents would significantly aid in precise diagnosis of this disease including the location of the lesions.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^115ukpGg]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The state-of-the-art MR imaging protocol for the diagnosis of endometriosis includes T2- and fat suppressed T1-weighted sequences.

T2-weighted sequences without fat-suppression are the best sequences for detecting pelvic endometriosis, in particular for the evaluation of fibrotic lesions.

Fat-suppressed T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo LAVA sequence. This pulse sequence improves the sensitivity of MR imaging in the detection of small lesions. It is the most sensitive for the detection of bloody foci and peritoneal endometriosis, since fat suppression narrows the dynamic signal range, thus accentuating the differences in tissue signal. It also increases MRI specificity, since fat-containing lesions such as dermoids are ruled out from the differential diagnosis of endometriomas. LAVA is a fast MR imaging sequence (acquisition time about 22 s), thus, when possible (cooperating patients), acquisition in the three spatial planes allows achieving better anatomical localization of small peritoneal implants, without prolonging too much the examination time.

Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted 3D gradient-echo LAVA sequence is useful in the following conditions:
detection of enhancing mural nodules within adnexal masses, when atypical features on US or T2-weighted MR sequences suggest potential malignancy;
in our experience the major benefit of intravenous gadolinium is ureter visualization. The anatomical relationship between the ureters and endometrial cysts or implants is important for the surgeon even when endometriotic lesions do not involve directly the ureters (Fig. 2). Indeed, because of their position from the lateral edge of the cervix, the ureters are particularly vulnerable to detachment or ligation during gynaecological surgery. Injury to the ureters is the most common urologic complication of pelvic surgery, with an incidence that ranges from 1% to 10%, most cases related to gynecologic procedures.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^111fAnkq]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because of its extreme clinical heterogeneity, pelvic endometriosis remains challenging to diagnose. Current evidence demonstrates that the disease should be diagnosed non-invasively by combining the information from patient history, clinical examination, imaging and response to medical treatment. Because the diagnostic accuracy of MRI may differ depending on radiologist experience, this review article aims to help radiologists obtain meaningful images with a tailored MR-acquisition protocol and recognize a wide range of pelvic changes that may result from endometriosis.

### Clues to revising the conventional diagnostic algorithm for endometriosis [^111DQHzm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a complex gynecologic disorder characterized primarily by symptoms of pelvic pain, infertility, and altered quality of life. National and international guidelines highlight the diagnostic difficulties and lack of conclusive diagnostic tools for endometriosis. Furthermore, guidelines are becoming questionable at an increasingly rapid rate as new diagnostic techniques emerge. This work aims to provide a knowledge synthesis of the relevance of various diagnostic tools and to assess areas of improvement of conventional algorithms. MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 2021 to December 2023 using relevant key words. Articles evaluating the diagnostic relevance and performance of various tools were included and independently reviewed by the authors for eligibility. Included studies were assessed using the GRADE and QUADAS-2 tools. Of the 4204 retrieved articles, 26 were included. While anamnesis and clinical examination do contribute to diagnostic accuracy, their level of evidence and impact on the diagnostic process remains limited. Although imaging techniques are recommended to investigate endometriosis, ultrasonography remains highly operator dependent. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to exhibit higher sensitivities than ultrasound. However, concerns persist with regards to the terminology, anatomical definition of lesions, and accuracies of both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Recently, several biological markers have been studied and cumulative evidence supports the contribution of noncoding RNAs to the diagnosis of endometriosis. Marginal improvements have been suggested for anamnesis, clinical examination, and imaging examinations. Conversely, some biomarkers, including the saliva microRNA signature for endometriosis, have emerged as diagnostic tools which inspire reflection on the revision of conventional diagnostic algorithms.

### Deep infiltrating endometriosis: can magnetic resonance imaging anticipate the need for colorectal surgeon intervention? [^1135cJCx]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features associated with colorectal surgical bowel resection for treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Materials and Methods

122 preoperative pelvic MRIs in women with laparoscopically-proven DIE and subsequent surgery (2006–2015) were identified, and retrospective cohort analysis performed. MRIs were reviewed independently by two radiologists blinded to surgical/histopathological outcomes. Associations between MRI characteristics of middle/posterior compartment endometriosis and surgical outcomes were investigated to identify MRI features associated with colorectal surgical bowel resection.

Results

MRI features associated with colorectal surgical intervention were: presence of an MRI bowel lesion (sensitivity 95.3%, specificity 63.3%, ROC-AUC 0.79); MRI bowel lesions ≥ 20mm in length (sensitivity 91%, specificity 77%, ROC-AUC 0.84); MRI bowel lesions invading the muscularis or submucosa/mucosa layers (sensitivity 95.3%, specificity 63.3%, ROC-AUC 0.90).

Conclusion

This study identifies MRI features that have potential diagnostic utility in identifying the need for colorectal surgical intervention in patients with DIE.

### Transvaginal US after bowel preparation for deeply infiltrating endometriosis: protocol, imaging appearances, and laparoscopic correlation [^114EsYQv]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a common gynecologic disease that is characterized by a difficult and delayed diagnosis. Radiologic mapping of the DIE lesion sites is crucial for case management, patient counseling, and surgical planning. Transvaginal ultrasonography (US) is the initial imaging modality for investigating DIE and has been the focus of several recent studies. DIE typically manifests at imaging as hypoechogenic nodules throughout the affected sites and thickening of the intestinal wall, with some lesions showing a mixed pattern due to cystic areas. Transvaginal US performed after bowel preparation improves the ability to diagnose intestinal lesions and provides invaluable details, including which layers of the intestine are affected and the distance between the lesion and the anal border. It is vital that radiologists be familiar with the technical aspects of this modality and with the US manifestations of DIE lesions. Transvaginal US performed after bowel preparation should be the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of women with suspected endometriosis.

### Deep infiltrating endometriosis: a pictorial essay [^113iWyYk]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a subperitoneal intrusion of endometrial tissue. Resulting endometrial nodules may develop on the uterosacral ligament, urinary tract, rectovaginal, and retrocervical areas, and less commonly in the urinary bladder, thoracic, and neural regions. Genetics, age, and environmental factors determine the progression of the disease. DIE manifests with numerous symptoms, which are similar to unrelated diseases, namely dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary tract infections, and infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and physical examination may detect and differentiate endometriosis lesions from other diseases. Its clinical management typically involves laparoscopic surgery and hormonal therapy. These are designed to improve the quality of life and to address individual reproductive goals. This pictorial essay aims to provide clinical cases to highlight the characteristic radiological findings in each diagnostic modality and in addition to elucidate the current clinical management of DIE.

### A practical guide to the clinical evaluation of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^114m7dhN]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Endometriosis: a multimodal imaging review [^112NNk8i]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized endometrial-like tissue present outside of the uterus, affecting approximately 10% of reproductive age women. It is associated with abdomino-pelvic pain, infertility and other non - gynecologic symptoms, making it a challenging diagnosis. Several guidelines have been developed by different international societies to diagnose and classify endometriosis, yet areas of controversy and uncertainty remains. Transvaginal ultrasound (TV-US) is the first-line imaging modality used to identify endometriosis due to its accessibility and cost-efficacy. Enhanced sonographic techniques are emerging as a dedicated technique to evaluate deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), depending on the expertise of the sonographer as well as the location of the lesions. MRI is an ideal complementary modality to ultrasonography for pre-operative planning as it allows for a larger field-of-view when required and it has high levels of reproducibility and tolerability. Typically, endometriotic lesions appear hypoechoic on ultrasonography. On MRI, classical features include DIE T2 hypointensity, endometrioma T2 hypointensity and T1 hyperintensity, while superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE) is described as a small focus of T1 hyperintensity. Imaging has become a critical tool in the diagnosis, surveillance and surgical planning of endometriosis. This literature review is based mostly on studies from the last two decades and aims to provide a detailed overview of the imaging features of endometriosis as well as the advances and usefulness of different imaging modalities for this condition.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^116LPy6R]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis, particularly deep pelvic infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), is a clinical issue affecting premenopausal women who may experience severe pelvic pain and infertility. These symptoms are mainly associated with the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, with consequent chronic inflammatory reactions and fibromuscular hyperplasia affecting the pelvic peritoneum and the pelvic wall and organs. The disease affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age and is diagnosed in approximately 20%–50% of infertile women and nearly 90% of infertile women with chronic pelvic pain. Accurate early diagnosis of DIE is crucial to provide women with early tailored treatments and avoid inappropriate surgery. Nevertheless, although many diagnostic techniques have been used, early diagnosis of DIE remains a major challenge.

Laparoscopic exploration is considered the diagnostic golden standard, because it allows for direct visualization of lesions; however, it is not a risk-free surgery and may underestimate retroperitoneal structures, such as nerves and ureters, with possible false negative procedures. Because a poor correlation has been demonstrated between the symptoms and severity of lesions, some authors suggest a paradigmatic shift to a more clinical diagnostic approach based on the combination of symptoms, imaging findings and response to empiric treatment, even before any surgical confirmation. In this scenario, transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in some cases computed tomography (CT) play a fundamental role. MRI, the imaging technique with the highest overall accuracy for assessing the extent of DIE, has high specificity for endometriotic foci, owing to its inherent soft-tissue resolution. Nevertheless, to achieve the expected accuracy, the examination itself and the image interpretation should be tailored to each woman's specific issues. This review provides radiologists with information on how to obtain good quality MRI images, interpret and report them correctly.

### Endometriosis: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^115AeaAR]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is an important gynecologic disorder primarily affecting women during their reproductive years. Pathologically, it is the result of functional endometrium located outside the uterus. It may vary from microscopic endometriotic implants to large cysts (endometriomas). The physical manifestations are protean, with some patients being asymptomatic and others having disabling pelvic pain, infertility, or adnexal masses. Symptoms do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease. Ultrasonographic (US) features are variable and can mimic those of other benign and malignant ovarian lesions. Low-level internal echoes and echogenic wall foci are more specific US features for endometriomas. Magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy, with endometriotic cysts typically appearing with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and demonstrating "shading" on T2-weighted images. The ovaries are the most common sites affected, but endometriosis can also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, chest, and soft tissues. Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging. Both medical and surgical treatment options are available depending on the patient's specific case.

### MR imaging in deep pelvic endometriosis: a pictorial essay [^113prPGB]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Deep pelvic endometriosis is an important gynecologic disorder that is responsible for severe pelvic pain and is defined as subperitoneal invasion that exceeds 5 mm in depth. Deep pelvic endometriosis can affect the retrocervical region, uterosacral ligaments, rectum, rectovaginal septum, vagina, urinary tract, and other extraperitoneal pelvic sites. It is commonly associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, urinary tract symptoms, and infertility. Because surgery remains the best therapeutic option for affected patients, the accurate preoperative assessment of the extension of endometriotic disease is extremely important. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive method with high spatial resolution that allows multiplanar evaluation of deep pelvic endometriosis and good tissue characterization, but without the use of ionizing radiation or iodinated contrast agents. MR imaging yields important findings that help grade the disease and identify subperitoneal lesion extension and other associated disease entities, thereby facilitating accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment. Radiologists should be familiar with the MR imaging findings of deep infiltrating endometriosis in various anatomic locations so that they can provide information that allows adequate presurgical counseling.

### Changing the "scope" of diagnosing endometriosis: the new frontier of noninvasive markers [^114xpFnU]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, and diagnosis is often delayed using conventional laparoscopy. Noninvasive markers of endometriosis have the potential to enable earlier diagnosis, leading to more timely treatment and better surgical planning. This issue's Views and Reviews seek to summarize the current status of noninvasive markers of endometriosis. Experts in reproductive medicine with prior work in this field summarize the key literature on endometrial biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and advanced imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. At present, there is no single definitive biomarker that can diagnose endometriosis with high sensitivity and specificity. Advancing endometriosis biomarkers beyond the discovery phase is challenging, and more work is needed. Clinicians who have an improved understanding of noninvasive imaging and biomarkers will be able to identify endometriosis earlier and more easily, allowing for prompt consideration of treatment options. We believe that continued research, innovation, and development will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and guidance toward the best treatments for endometriosis-related pain and infertility.

### Diagnosis of deep endometriosis: clinical examination, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other techniques [^115DrUkF]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of the present review was to evaluate the contribution of clinical examination and imaging techniques, mainly transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose deep infiltrating (DE) locations using prisma statement recommendations. Clinical examination has a relative low sensitivity and specificity to diagnose DE. Independently of DE locations, for all transvaginal sonography techniques a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 94% are observed approaching criteria for a triage test. Whatever the protocol and MRI devices, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for pelvic endometriosis diagnosis were 94% and 77%, respectively. For rectosigmoid endometriosis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 92% and 96%, respectively fulfilling criteria of replacement test. In conclusion, advances in imaging techniques offer high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose DE with at least triage value and for rectosigmoid endometriosis replacement value imposing a revision of the concept of laparoscopy as the gold standard.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^114HsDX4]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a second-line technique after transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) for exploring patients with a suspicion of endometriosis. The combination of these two imaging modalities and physical examination increases diagnostic accuracy, especially for deep-pelvic endometriosis (DE) locations. Beyond its excellent sensitivity, the main advantage of MR imaging is the possibility of reviewing images by an expert or during a multidisciplinary session before deciding on surgical management.

As endometriosis is a benign disease that may require very complex surgery with potentially long-term impact on the quality of life of the patient, the standardization of MR reporting is critical. Recently, the European Society of Radiology underlined that optimal communication between the imaging team and patients is an essential component of patient-centered and value-based care. This is particularly important in the context of endometriosis management. The imaging report is a crucial tool for communication.

Since the previous consensus, several authors have proposed a consensual lexicon and developed different reporting classifications to improve communication between the radiologist and the patient or the radiologist and the surgeon. This is why it is time to change imaging guidelines in endometriosis.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^111z9Z46]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Usefulness of drawings

Radiology is deeply integrated into the patient care pathway and plays a crucial role in shaping the patient experience. All experts have highlighted the importance and value of clear communication with patients. The traditional models of care, where imaging findings were communicated solely between the radiologist and the referring physician, and management decisions were made without patient input, are no longer viable. The concept of the patient as a passive participant in the decision-making process is increasingly unacceptable. Patient-centered care demands that patients be involved in all major decisions, but this involvement is only meaningful if patients are fully informed about all relevant information, including radiology findings.

"Patient-centered care" is a key dimension of quality care. Patients with confirmed endometriosis often express dissatisfaction with their medical support, and a lack of information is the most significant indicator of dissatisfaction with their overall patient experience. Communication, information, and education have been previously identified as critical areas for improvement in endometriosis clinics, as they are highly valued by patients and are frequently perceived negatively. Beyond procedural accuracy, patients place great importance on receiving information and having clear communication with their radiologist, including explanations of results and personal consultations. However, effective communication with patients can be challenging in busy radiology departments, where the focus is often on efficient and accurate diagnosis. Despite this, optimized communication between patients and radiologists is a vital component of delivering patient-centered and value-based care. Therefore, the availability of the radiologist, as well as the tools they use to explain the diagnosis, is of paramount importance and is integral to the concept of value-based radiology.

Furthermore, studies, such as those by Gutzeit et al, report that the opportunity for patients to discuss MRI findings before leaving the department significantly increases their confidence in the radiology service. Good communication with patients, as well as among the healthcare team, has the potential to improve care coordination, enhance safety and outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, and reduce healthcare costs.

In this setting, the role of drawings to illustrate disease mapping is crucial. These drawings significantly aid clinical counseling and, more importantly, surgical planning. They are invaluable for guiding surgeons during complex procedures, making it essential to highlight their importance. This was the main reason for including diagrams in reports.

Among the ESUR expert group, 9/20 experts (45%) use or agreed to use drawings in their report to improve communication with patients (user = 3/20, not yes but will 6/20) (Fig. 4).

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^113Kcu1W]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We illustrate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of endometriosis.

Background

Endometriosis is a chronic gynaecological condition affecting women of reproductive age and may cause pelvic pain and infertility. It is characterized by the growth of functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus and includes three different manifestations: ovarian endometriomas, peritoneal implants, deep pelvic endometriosis. The primary locations are in the pelvis; extrapelvic endometriosis may rarely occur. Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical history, invasive and non-invasive techniques. The definitive diagnosis is based on laparoscopy with histological confirmation. Diagnostic imaging is necessary for treatment planning. MRI is as a second-line technique after ultrasound. The MRI appearance of endometriotic lesions is variable and depends on the quantity and age of haemorrhage, the amount of endometrial cells, stroma, smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. The purpose of surgery is to achieve complete resection of all endometriotic lesions in the same operation.

Conclusion

Owing to the possibility to perform a complete assessment of all pelvic compartments at one time, MRI represents the best imaging technique for preoperative staging of endometriosis, in order to choose the more appropriate surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work.

Teaching Points

- Endometriosis includes ovarian endometriomas, peritoneal implants and deep pelvic endometriosis.
- MRI is a second-line imaging technique after US.
- Deep pelvic endometriosis is associated with chronic pelvic pain and infertility.
- Endometriosis is characterized by considerable diagnostic delay.
- MRI is the best imaging technique for preoperative staging of endometriosis.

### ACOG issues recommendations for the management of… [^114BKXN5]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Obstetrics and Gynecology. These guidelines replace Technical Bulletin No. 184, which was published in September 1993. Diagnosis The ACOG committee states that a histologic examination should be done to confirm the presence of endometrial lesions, especially those with a nonclassical appearance. Only an experienced surgeon familiar with the protean appearances of endometriosis should rely on visual inspection to make the diagnosis. Peritoneal biopsy may be used to diagnose questionable peritoneal lesions. A noninvasive alternative to tissue biopsy is being sought by researchers. Correlating moderate and severe endometriosis and CA 125 concentration in serum is one possibility. However, the utility of measuring serum CA 125 levels as a diagnostic marker is limited, especially in women with mild or minimal disease. Peritoneal fluid levels appear to be better for detecting minimal to moderate disease.

Recommendations According to the ACOG committee, current evidence suggests that pain caused by endometriosis can be managed medically. Progestins, danazol, oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists have all been shown to reduce the size of lesions. However, no medical therapy has been proved to eradicate the lesions. Furthermore, there is no evidence that such treatment affects the future fertility of women with endometriosis. Studies are lacking that suggest the absence of treatment is associated with a decline in fertility. The following recommendations from ACOG are based on Level B scientific evidence: Therapy with a GnRH agonist is an appropriate approach to the management of the woman with chronic pelvic pain, even in the absence of surgical confirmation of endometriosis, provided that a detailed initial evaluation fails to demonstrate some other cause of pelvic pain.

For pain relief, oral contraceptives and oral or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate are effective in comparison with placebo and may be equivalent to other more costly regimens. Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen is not contraindicated following hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. The following ACOG recommendations are based primarily on Level C data: For severe endometriosis, medical treatment alone may not be sufficient. Because endometriosis often is unpredictable and may regress, expectant management may be appropriate in asymptomatic patients.

### Global trends in the uptake of specialist diagnostic ultrasound and MRI scans for endometriosis: an international cross-sectional survey [^112q4tfx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women globally. We aimed to determine health provider involvement and preferred methods of obtaining an endometriosis diagnosis across international jurisdictions. A global cross-sectional survey, distributed through formal and informal FIGO Reproductive Medicine, Endocrinology, and Infertility (REI) committee networks from September through October 2024. A total of 445 respondents from 76 countries began the survey, with 360 completions. Of the respondents, 63.9% were female, with most being gynecologists. Academics and/or researchers comprised 6.7%, with 39.2% involved in research in some capacity. Endometriosis was largely diagnosed by gynecologists (95.0%), with most respondents overall describing ultrasound as the most common method of diagnosis (77.8%). Of those surveyed, 93.6% stated clinicians in their country used non-invasive imaging (predominantly ultrasound) to diagnose endometriosis before surgery. One third of respondents did not feel confident distinguishing between routine gynecological scans and specialist endometriosis imaging. Significant barriers for uptake of imaging diagnostics included access to training, cost, and geographical accessibility. Regarding adoption of non-invasive imaging in clinical care, "game-changing" effects were described, including improvements in surgical preoperative mapping, and patient-centered care, with concerns that it could increase clinical workloads. Significantly, shifts in endometriosis diagnosis, from visualization of lesions at laparoscopy to non-invasive imaging diagnostics, were observed internationally. Policies should aim to overcome barriers to uptake of imaging-based diagnostics by supporting training initiatives, reducing associated costs, and improving geographical accessibility. Respondents predicted transformative changes in endometriosis care once non-invasive endometriosis diagnostics are effectively adopted.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^11698W4i]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is a chronic multifocal gynecologic disease that affects women of reproductive age and may cause pelvic pain and infertility. The aetiology of endometriosis is unknown; the pathogenesis is complex, multifactorial and still debated. The disease is characterized by the growth of functional ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. Its prevalence is of approximately 10% in women of reproductive age, 20–50% in women with infertility and nearly 90% in women with chronic pelvic pain. It is thought that the disease affects about 176 million women of reproductive age worldwide, with a peak of incidence between 24 and 29 years.

The disease includes three different manifestations, namely ovarian endometriomas, superficial peritoneal implants, and deep pelvic endometriosis. The latter is defined as endometriotic lesions penetrating into the retroperitoneal space or the wall of the pelvic organs to a depth of at least 5 mm; it has an estimated prevalence of 1% among women of reproductive age and affects up to 20% of women with endometriosis.

Although the definitive diagnosis is based on laparoscopy or surgery with histological verification of endometrial glands and/or stroma, imaging is necessary for treatment planning.

Among imaging modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used as a problem-solving additional examination in complex cases and should be considered as a second-line technique after ultrasound (US). Currently, MRI is considered the best imaging technique for mapping endometriosis, since it provides a more reliable map of deep infiltrating endometriosis than physical examination and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS).

In this article we review clinical manifestations and histological features of endometriosis. We describe MR imaging appearances of the different manifestations of pelvic endometriosis and some extrapelvic locations, using examples, many of which pathologically proven, from our institution. Our MR protocol is also included.

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^115RTd9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

- To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.• To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity ≥ 94% and specificity ≥ 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test - if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity ≥ 50% with specificity ≥ 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test - if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).

Main Results

We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi-detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT-e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results. Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC-TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT-e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS-BP, RWC-TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT-e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.

### Reasons why it is time to change imaging guidelines on endometriosis [^114bqwKh]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In light of the rising number of patients referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to suspected endometriosis and the high expectations of these patients, there is a need for new imaging guidelines to optimally protocol and indicate MRI and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) examinations. This is crucial for accurately addressing the inquiries of gynecologists, encompassing complete mapping and preoperative staging, and facilitating effective communication with patients. In this context, the development of a standardized lexicon, as well as dedicated imaging classifications, is recommended to aid in the comprehensive management of patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The radiologist should use a standardized lexicon and provide a score along with details about the specific compartments affected by endometriosis disease. This helps in offering clearer guidance to the surgeon. KEY POINTS:
- An optimal staging is based on the combination of clinical examination, transvaginal US, and MRI.
- MRI is able to detect location that is hidden at the beginning of a laparoscopic surgery and thus the need for dedicated MR classifications to correctly stage the disease.
- Deep pelvic endometriosis index (dPEI) classification is externally validated and highly correlated with operating time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications.

### Endometriosis: does the menstrual cycle affect magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation? [^1169W7Ky]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine if the menstrual cycle affects MR interpretation in patients with pelvic endometriosis.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-one patients with either laparoscopically proven endometriosis, or a high clinical suspicion of deep infiltrative endometriosis, were prospectively recruited from May 2008 to October 2009 and January to June 2012. Two pelvic MR scans were performed for pre-operative planning; during menses and the other mid-cycle. Two experienced radiologists independently assessed image quality and disease extent. Both were blinded to patient identity, previous imaging and menstrual status. Interobserver agreement was assessed using the Kappa (k) test. Descriptive statistics were prepared using chi-squared (or Fishers' exact) tests and Mann-Whitney (rank sum) tests to assess for significant differences between menstrual and non-menstrual imaging.

Results

Interobserver agreement for image quality was moderate for T2 weighted imaging (k = 0.475, p-value < 0.001) and substantial for T1 fat saturated imaging (k = 0.733, p-value < 0.001), with no significant difference in image quality between menstrual and non-menstrual scans (all p-values > 0.255). Readers demonstrated at least moderate interobserver agreement for certainty level of endometriosis at site-specific locations, with median k 0.599 (IQR 0.488–0.807). No significant difference in disease extent was observed between menstruating and non-menstruating scans (all p-values > 0.05).

Conclusion

Findings suggest no significant differences in image quality, disease extent or disease severity between menstruating and non-menstruating MR; thus, timing of pelvic MR for assessment of endometriosis need not be influenced by the menstrual cycle.

### European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines: MR imaging of pelvic endometriosis [^11656BVM]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition of unknown aetiology that primarily affects women of reproductive age. The accepted first-line imaging modality is pelvic ultrasound. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly performed as an additional investigation in complex cases and for surgical planning. There is currently no international consensus regarding patient preparation, MRI protocols or reporting criteria. Our aim was to develop clinical guidelines for MRI evaluation of pelvic endometriosis based on literature evidence and consensus expert opinion. This work was performed by a group of radiologists from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR), experts in gynaecological imaging and a gynaecologist expert in methodology. The group discussed indications for MRI, technical requirements, patient preparation, MRI protocols and criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis on MRI. The expert panel proposed a final recommendation for each criterion using Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 levels of evidence.

Key Points

- This report provides guidelines for MRI in endometriosis.
- Minimal and optimal MRI acquisition protocols are provided.
- Recommendations are proposed for patient preparation, best MRI sequences and reporting criteria.

### Use of narrowband imaging for the detection of endometriosis [^112Xrdqo]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show a new technique using narrowband imaging for the detection of endometriosis.

Design

A step-by-step illustration of the difference in visualization of endometriosis using a visible light spectrum laparoscope compared with a narrowband imaging light source.

Setting

Radical excision of endometriosis is considered the best treatment to control the disease extent and symptoms of endometriosis. Therefore, it is imperative that all endometriotic lesions are recognized and identified in order to thoroughly remove them. A narrowband imaging system enhances the visualization of capillary vessels and microstructures containing blood hemoglobin on the mucosal surface. It makes use of 415- and 540-nm filters that are strongly absorbed by blood hemoglobin. In this manner, microvessels, which are not clearly seen by conventional light, are enhanced. With the inherent neovascularization noted in endometriosis, endometriotic lesions may be more recognizable. Clear vesicular lesions of endometriosis are glandular excrescences, which are early signs of recurrent inflammation from endometriosis with accompanying angiogenesis. These are more pronounced under narrowband imaging.

Interventions

The use of the visible light spectrum contrasted with narrowband imaging that changes the normal color contrasts of the endoscopic image in the different areas of the pelvic cavity.

Measurements and Main Results

Narrowband imaging is helpful as an additional modality for the identification of endometriosis. In particular, clear vesicular lesions of endometriosis, which are not as evident under the visible light spectrum, are more pronounced under narrowband imaging. Its strength lies in its usefulness in the treatment of patients with endometriosis with symptoms of pain. It is especially useful for those with marked symptoms but, on first glance at laparoscopy, seems to have minimal disease. Narrowband imaging enhances the endometriotic lesions and makes it easier to visualize and identify them, knowing that these subtle lesions may well be the cause of the pain. However, its usefulness is decreased if performed after the initiation of surgery because of the bleeding incurred from dissection, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the red blood cells and endometriotic lesions.

Conclusion

Narrowband imaging can be used as an adjunct to improve the detection of endometriosis.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^114uGjSi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy for pelvic pain and endometriosis — rationale states that chronic pelvic pain is typically defined as pelvic pain lasting more than 6 months and is a complex disorder with multiple etiologies; it affects many women, can severely impair quality of life, and often remains of obscure etiology despite many diagnostic tests. Diagnostic laparoscopy is described as an excellent tool for direct visualization of the pelvis that may help identify the etiology of patients' pain, facilitates therapeutic intervention, and may help ameliorate the morbidity of an open exploration.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: indications, reporting, and classifications [^117QH7t1]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The experts did not reach an agreement regarding the use of MRI in follow-up to monitor medical treatment response (50%, 10/20), even though this type of indication is becoming more established in clinical practice.

Statement 1: MRI is recommended when TVUS is inconclusive in diagnosing endometriosis or negative, in a symptomatic patient (Grade A, strong agreement), before surgery or interventional procedure, or after surgical treatment if symptoms persist (strong agreement).

When TVUS is not feasible (virgins, adolescents, and patients who are unable to undergo the transvaginal examination due to pain, vaginismus, or claustrophobia), MRI can be indicated as a first-line technique.

Classification and reporting

Usefulness of MR classifications

Disease staging is crucial for both clinical and research activities related to endometriosis. No single staging system is universally competent or applicable to all aspects of endometriosis care, and different approaches should be viewed as complementary. Multiple surgical and radiological classifications exist; however, a broad international consensus has not yet been reached to indicate which of these systems should be recommended for routine use.

Surgical classifications provide a comprehensive staging of DE and evaluate peritoneal, ovarian, and tubal involvement, as well as the presence of adenomyosis. Prominent among these are the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL), the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM), and the #Enzian classification. It is essential to recognize the distinction between the surgeon's operative perspective and the radiologist's imaging perspective in evaluating a given patient. The radiologist visualizes the entire pelvis in cross-section, encompassing all organs and anatomical spaces within a single visual field, in fact, in multiple anatomical orthogonal planes, which is the major advantage. In contrast, the surgeon, through laparoscopy, views the peritoneum and the external surface of underlying organs. Laparoscopic surgical classifications do not provide a comprehensive evaluation of pelvic endometriosis. The surgeon cannot initially visualize the internal structures of organs or retroperitoneal spaces, nor can they directly assess the depth of DE within organs or discern the boundaries between organs in cases of obliterated cul-de-sac or the precise location of DE lesions. Radiologists, therefore, must invest time and effort into understanding evolving disease concepts and treatment options and maintain effective communication with referring colleagues to ensure their knowledge remains current across medical fields beyond radiology. By integrating imaging expertise with an understanding of disease management, radiologists contribute significantly to patient care.

### Endometriosis revisited: an imaging review of the usual and unusual manifestations with pathological correlation [^111QGuZm]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The manifestations of endometriosis commonly present a diagnostic challenge to the gynecologist and radiologist. Familiarity with its varied presentations may allow for a more accurate diagnosis. The goal of this review is to the present the imaging spectrum of endometriosis, less common sites of involvement as well as the potential rare complications. Relevant surgical and histopathological correlation is also provided. In addition to clinical evaluation and sonography, MRI is a highly accurate imaging modality in the diagnosis of endometriosis. It possesses a distinctive advantage over other modalities in that it allows a complete survey of the pelvic compartments. The potentially devastating effects of endometriosis include pelvic pain and even infertility. Since standard treatment is surgical, the radiologist needs to be familiar with the various manifestations in order to aid diagnosis for appropriate management.
