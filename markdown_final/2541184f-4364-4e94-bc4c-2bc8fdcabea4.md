## Question

How can UTIs be distinguished from other etiologies of hematuria in young children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish UTIs from other etiologies of hematuria in young children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and risk assessment to frame pretest probability. Then, I should verify physical examination features that pivot the differential. Next, I will check urine collection methods and the urinalysis with microscopy, since that is the diagnostic fulcrum. After that, I will delineate decision pathways for UTI versus glomerular and non-infectious nonglomerular causes. I should then review confirmatory testing and imaging strategies, followed by special tests when UTI is confirmed or when alternative etiologies are suspected. Finally, I will consider follow-up, re-evaluation, and key distinguishing principles, double-checking where evidence is strong versus evolving.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context-setting items in history because they immediately change pretest probability and management tempo; age and sex matter, with higher prevalence of UTI in girls after infancy, and febrile infants 2–24 months without a clear source warrant particular suspicion for UTI, while classic voiding symptoms point lower and flank pain points upper tract, and I should not miss clues for stones, inherited disorders, prenatal abnormalities, diet/medication exposures, or a recent streptococcal infection suggesting post-infectious glomerulonephritis [^11797t3a] [^113KcgBB] [^1119aojP] [^111W4Dea].

> Hold on, I should verify the examination pivots because they help separate infection from glomerular and structural disease; fever, irritability, suprapubic tenderness and CVA tenderness support UTI syndromes, whereas edema or hypertension suggest glomerulonephritis, dysmorphic features may imply syndromic disorders, abdominal masses or asymmetric kidneys nudge toward Wilms tumor or other urologic pathology, and visible or reported trauma redirects to traumatic hematuria requiring a different imaging pathway [^1119aojP] [^1126CRh8] [^114oKd3H] [^111YBxih].

> I need to ensure proper urine collection before interpreting any laboratory results; in non–toilet-trained infants, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is required for culture confirmation, while clean catch is acceptable for screening in toilet-trained children, and I must avoid bag urine for culture because of high contamination and false positives that can derail the diagnosis and cascade testing unnecessarily [^113KcgBB] [^111EbSMg] [^116MkiuE] [^115NM8v3].

> Next, I should review the urinalysis with microscopy carefully; pyuria and bacteriuria support UTI, and combining both markedly improves rule-in performance, but wait, let me verify sensitivity because recent pediatric data show that about 20% of catheterized, culture-proven febrile UTIs lack pyuria, meaning absence of pyuria does not fully exclude UTI, especially in high-pretest settings, so I must integrate the whole picture and not over-interpret a negative dipstick in fresh urine alone [^111REyFG] [^117Qwkiu] [^115NM8v3].

> I will now examine markers that pull toward glomerular disease rather than UTI; RBC casts are essentially pathognomonic for a glomerular source, dysmorphic RBCs point glomerular, and significant proteinuria beyond trace suggests glomerular involvement, so if I see these, I should not anchor on UTI even if there is some sterile pyuria, and I need to pivot to a nephritic workup and referral pathway promptly [^1126CRh8] [^1119aojP] [^116bDCFp].

> But wait, what if the UA shows isolated hematuria without pyuria, bacteriuria, or proteinuria; in that scenario I should consider non-glomerular, non-infectious etiologies such as hypercalciuria, stones, and structural anomalies, and crystals on microscopy can be an early clue before imaging confirms a calculus or metabolic lithogenic state [^114qg7k6] [^1126CRh8].

> Pathway A, consistent with UTI, requires me to confirm infection with culture from a properly collected specimen, and the contemporary pediatric standard is at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen from a catheterized or suprapubic sample, after which I should initiate empiric antibiotics aligned with local antibiograms and culture-tailor later, obtain a renal/bladder ultrasound for first febrile UTI or complicated presentations, and avoid routine VCUG unless the ultrasound is abnormal or there are atypical or complex features; in recurrent or febrile UTIs in toilet-trained children, assessing and treating bowel and bladder dysfunction reduces recurrence risk [^111EbSMg] [^112uQGFf] [^113ugj5F] [^115LWH9e] [^115ads4f].

> Pathway B, suggestive of glomerular disease, should trigger a different cascade; if hematuria coexists with significant proteinuria and especially RBC casts, I should not diagnose UTI as primary, and I need serum creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, and if post-infectious GN is suspected, complement levels and ASO titers, with urgent nephrology referral because timely management may mitigate acute complications and guide biopsy decisions if indicated [^1126CRh8] [^1119aojP].

> Pathway C, isolated hematuria without infection markers, calls for targeted screening for hypercalciuria using a urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, and imaging with renal/bladder ultrasound to evaluate for stones, congenital anomalies, and the rare but critical Wilms tumor, reserving low-dose CT when stones are suspected but not seen on ultrasound, and considering coagulation studies if the history suggests a bleeding diathesis or anticoagulant exposure [^114qg7k6] [^114oKd3H] [^114bDi9D].

> If UTI is confirmed, I should double-check whether additional tests refine severity and site; procalcitonin thresholds around 0.5 ng/mL can support upper tract involvement, blood culture is reasonable in febrile, ill-appearing children, and checking serum electrolytes is pragmatic because hyponatremia has been associated with more severe disease, though I must acknowledge variability in the evidence and use these adjuncts to complement, not replace, core clinical assessment and imaging [^111zVyMW] [^1174tKiQ] [^112NMybt].

> Let me reconsider imaging strategy more broadly; first-line imaging for hematuria in children is ultrasound because it is noninvasive and avoids radiation, while CT is reserved for specific indications like suspected stones invisible on ultrasound or complex trauma, and VCUG should be employed selectively when ultrasound reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or there are recurrent febrile UTIs or atypical features, aligning with modern risk-based imaging to avoid unnecessary radiation and instrumentation [^114bDi9D] [^113KcgBB].

> I should now synthesize the differential in words rather than a table; UTI typically couples pyuria with bacteriuria and compatible symptoms and is confirmed by quantitative culture, glomerulonephritis is flagged by proteinuria and RBC casts with or without hypertension, hypercalciuria often presents as isolated microscopic or sometimes gross hematuria, urolithiasis adds colicky flank pain or crystals, structural anomalies and, rarely, tumors enter when hematuria persists or imaging is abnormal, and recent streptococcal infection plus complement changes suggests post-infectious GN rather than UTI [^111EbSMg] [^1126CRh8] [^114qg7k6] [^114oKd3H] [^1119aojP].

> Next, I should review follow-up and re-evaluation; after treating a culture-confirmed UTI, repeating urinalysis ensures resolution of pyuria and bacteriuria and checks whether hematuria has cleared, and if hematuria persists despite adequate therapy, I need to step back and reconsider alternative diagnoses and imaging, while children with renal scarring warrant longitudinal monitoring of blood pressure and proteinuria given the association with later hypertension and CKD risk, even as practice trends minimize excessive imaging and antibiotics in low-risk contexts [^115NM8v3] [^1119aojP] [^116doJUG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without crystallizing the key distinguishing principles; the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria dramatically increases the likelihood of UTI, RBC casts essentially localize bleeding to the glomerulus and should not be attributed to simple UTI, significant proteinuria points away from isolated lower tract infection, absence of pyuria with hematuria argues for noninfectious causes though up to one fifth of culture-proven pediatric UTIs may lack pyuria, and all of this rests on appropriate urine collection because bag specimens can mislead and inflate contamination rates [^111REyFG] [^1126CRh8] [^117Qwkiu] [^115NM8v3].

UTIs in young children are best differentiated from other causes of hematuria by **pyuria and bacteriuria on urinalysis** [^115CCwfn] and **≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen** [^111EbSMg] from a catheterized or suprapubic specimen [^113KcgBB]. Glomerular causes show proteinuria, red cell casts, and dysmorphic RBCs [^1119aojP]; stones/trauma present with flank pain or trauma history [^111W4Dea]; and tumors may cause painless hematuria with masses [^114qg7k6] [^114oKd3H]. Use **ultrasound** [^114bDi9D] for persistent or gross hematuria, and **VCUG** only if ultrasound is abnormal or reflux is suspected [^115LWH9e]. Prompt, accurate diagnosis **prevents renal scarring** [^115zryJw] and guides appropriate management [^113KcgBB].

---

## Clinical presentation and history

- **UTI symptoms**: Dysuria, frequency, urgency [^115NM8v3], suprapubic pain, fever [^111EbSMg], and sometimes gross hematuria [^113KcgBB].
- **Glomerular disease**: Proteinuria, edema, hypertension, and red cell casts [^1119aojP] [^116bDCFp].
- **Stones/trauma**: Flank pain [^111W4Dea], colic, or trauma history [^111YBxih].
- **Tumors**: Painless hematuria [^114qg7k6], possible mass or weight loss [^114oKd3H].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Urinalysis

- **UTI findings**: Pyuria (WBCs) [^117Qwkiu], bacteriuria [^115CCwfn], positive leukocyte esterase [^111EbSMg], and nitrites [^113KcgBB].
- **Glomerular disease**: Proteinuria, red cell casts, dysmorphic RBCs [^1119aojP] [^116bDCFp].
- **Stones/trauma**: Hematuria without pyuria or bacteriuria [^111W4Dea] [^111YBxih].

---

### Urine culture

On urine culture, a **UTI diagnosis** requires ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen [^111EbSMg] from a catheterized or suprapubic specimen [^113KcgBB], whereas **other causes** typically yield negative or mixed growth [^112uhHoH].

---

## Imaging studies

Ultrasound is recommended for **persistent or gross hematuria** to detect structural abnormalities, stones, or tumors [^114bDi9D], and **VCUG** is indicated if the ultrasound is abnormal or reflux is suspected [^115LWH9e] [^115NM8v3].

### Urolithiasis in children: Medical approach [^111W4Dea]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Obtaining a thorough medical history followed by careful examination is essential for establishing an accurate diagnosis. Information pertaining to a family history of calculi, hematuria, and renal failure can be essential in identifying those patients at the highest risk for inherited metabolic or genetic conditions (e.g. cystinuria, primary hyperoxaluria, and Dent disease). A focused dietary history with special emphasis on fluid and salt intake, vitamin (C, D) mineral supplementation, and special diets (e.g. ketogenic diet) is indicated in every patient. Eliciting a detailed medication history with special emphasis on corticosteroids, diuretics (furosemide and acetazolamide), protease inhibitors (indinavir), and anticonvulsants (topiramate and zonisamide) can be instructive.

Children with a history of prematurity, urinary tract abnormalities, urinary tract infections (UTIs), intestinal malabsorption (e.g. Crohn's disease, bowel resection, and cystic fibrosis), and prolonged immobility are all at special risk for calculi formation. A detailed physical examination of the child for dysmorphic features (Williams syndrome), rickets (Dent disease and HHRH), tetany (FHHNC and autosomal dominant hypocalcemic hypercalciuria), and gout (HPRT deficiency, PRPSS) can be helpful.

**Acute cystitis in pediatric patients**: The AAP 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a urine specimen for both culture and urinalysis through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration before administering antimicrobial therapy. This should be done in febrile infants with no apparent source for the fever, especially if antimicrobial therapy is deemed necessary due to ill appearance or another pressing reason.

### Evaluation of gross hematuria [^114qg7k6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

For specific circumstances involving acute cystitis in pediatric patients, the AAP 2016 guidelines recommend not obtaining voiding cystourethrography routinely after the first febrile UTI. It should be obtained if a renal and bladder ultrasound reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that suggest high-grade vesicoureteral reflux or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, particularly with respect to pediatric patients, the 2016 AAP guidelines recommend documenting both urinalysis results indicating infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of at least 50,000 CFUs/mL of a uropathogen. This should be cultured from a urine specimen obtained through transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration to establish the diagnosis of UTI.

### ACR appropriateness criteria hematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances.

This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria:

- **Isolated hematuria**: Nonpainful, nontraumatic, and can be microscopic versus macroscopic.
- **Painful hematuria**: Suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis.
- **Renal trauma with hematuria**: Microscopic versus macroscopic.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence.

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^1119aojP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In cases where a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis vary with the underlying disease.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^112q8FLX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are commonly seen in the emergency department and pose several challenges in establishing a proper diagnosis and determining management. This article reviews pediatric UTI and addresses epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and imaging, emphasizing their importance to the practicing emergency medicine provider. An accurate and timely diagnosis of pediatric UTI can prevent short-term complications, such as severe pyelonephritis or sepsis, and long-term sequelae including scarring of the kidneys, hypertension, and ultimately chronic renal insufficiency and the need for transplant.

### Urinary tract infection in children: Diagnosis, treatment, imaging - comparison of current guidelines [^114435LA]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood; yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

- **Methods**: An analysis was performed of the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment, and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

- **Conclusions**: The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

### Accuracy of screening tests for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in young children [^117Qwkiu]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of available tests for pyuria, including newer automated tests, and to examine the implications of requiring them for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Methods**: We included children between 1 and 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTIs who presented to one of three pediatric centers. Using a positive urine culture result as the reference standard, we compared the sensitivity of five modalities for assessing pyuria at the cutoffs most often used clinically for detecting children with a positive culture result: leukocyte esterase on a dipstick, white blood cell (WBC) count on manual microscopy with and without using a hemocytometer, automated WBC enumeration using flow cytometry, and automated WBC enumeration using digital imaging with particle recognition.

- **Results**: A total of 4188 children were included. Among febrile children, the sensitivity of the two most widely available modalities, the leukocyte esterase test and WBC enumeration using digital imaging, had sensitivity values of 84% (95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.87) and 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.83), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that for febrile children under 36 months of age undergoing bladder catheterization for suspected UTI, pyuria will be absent in approximately 20% of children who are eventually shown to have pure growth of a pathogen on a culture. This raises questions about the appropriateness of requiring pyuria for the diagnosis of UTIs.

### Role of routine urinalysis in asymptomatic pediatric patients [^113Rprxx]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate the spectrum of diagnoses and identify risk factors for significant kidney disease in asymptomatic children with proteinuria and/or microhematuria detected by routine urinalysis. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by retrospective chart review of 239 patients who were referred to a tertiary care center. The predominant diagnosis in children with isolated microhematuria was hypercalciuria, while orthostatic proteinuria was common in those with isolated proteinuria. When microhematuria and proteinuria were present in combination, kidney disease was the predominant diagnosis. Urinalysis is a valuable tool for identifying patients with kidney disease. The combination of microhematuria and proteinuria increases the risk of having significant kidney disease.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^111t2BAs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to the revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on the prevention of febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

The EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines address the management of acute cystitis, particularly in pediatric patients. They recommend assessing bladder and bowel dysfunction, as well as lower urinary tract function, in any toilet-trained child presenting with febrile and/or recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), and advise treatment as necessary.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^111W429b]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy is more common in adults.

The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria following a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### Gross hematuria in children: A ten-year review [^114oKd3H]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in children is uncommon. We reviewed our experience characterizing its clinical presentation and diagnosis. The charts of all patients who presented during the 10-year period from 1994 through 2003 were reviewed, identifying 342 patients. Among these, 272 were boys (80%) and 70 were girls (20%). At presentation, 21 patients (6%) were younger than 3 years (17 boys and 4 girls); 199 (58%) were 3 to 12 years old (155 boys and 44 girls); and 122 (36%) were 13 to 20 years old (100 boys and 22 girls).

- **Results**: Of the 272 male patients, 52 (19%) had benign urethrorrhagia; 48 (14%) had trauma; 48 had a urinary tract infection (14%), and 10 of these also had urologic anomalies. Among the 342 patients, 45 (13%) had one or more congenital urologic anomalies. Specifically, 20 boys and 2 girls had vesicoureteral reflux; 10 boys had posterior urethral valves; 7 boys and 1 girl had ureteropelvic junction obstruction; 7 boys had proximal hypospadias; 2 boys and 1 girl had ureterovesical junction obstruction; 2 boys and 1 girl had ureterocele; and 1 boy had a caliceal diverticulum. Furthermore, 18 patients (5%) had stones; 3 had low-grade bladder transitional cell carcinoma; and 1 had a Wilms tumor. For 118 patients (34%; 95 boys and 23 girls), no etiology was found.

- **Conclusions**: Gross hematuria most often had a benign cause in children and adolescents. It was more common in boys across almost all etiologic categories and age groups. The extent of the urologic evaluation should depend on the clinical setting.

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yield a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### Urinary tract infections in young children and infants: Common questions and answers [^115NM8v3]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. They have a high recurrence rate and are associated with anatomic and functional abnormalities. The decision to test for UTI is based on risk factors and the child's age. Urinalysis is valuable to rule out UTI and to help decide when to start antibiotics; however, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Urine specimens collected via perineal bagging should not be used for culture because of high false-positive rates. Diagnosis of UTI requires pyuria and bacterial growth in the urine culture.

Prompt treatment of UTIs reduces renal scarring. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. In most cases, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous agents. When intravenous antibiotics are used, early transition to an oral regimen is as effective as longer intravenous courses. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful to identify acute complications and anatomic abnormalities. Voiding cystourethrography is indicated when ultrasound findings are abnormal and in cases of recurrent febrile UTIs.

Use of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs is controversial. Identification and treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunction can prevent UTI recurrence.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: A systematic review [^111REyFG]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

A total of 39 studies reporting 101 data sets evaluated microscopy for diagnosing UTI. Microscopy was used to determine the presence of pyuria, bacteriuria, or combinations of the two.

- **Summary of results**: There was significant heterogeneity in all pooled estimates; therefore, these should be interpreted with caution.

Figure 4 shows the estimates of sensitivity and 1-specificity plotted in ROC space for all studies. This graph suggests that bacteriuria is considerably better than pyuria both for ruling out and ruling in disease. The diagnostic performance of bacteriuria may be improved when combined with pyuria. The pooled positive likelihood ratios are highest for a combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (37.0, 95% CI: 11.0, 125.9), where a positive result was defined as both tests positive, supporting the suggestion that the combination of a positive result for both of these tests may be useful for ruling in disease. Conversely, the lowest negative likelihood ratio resulted from the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (0.11, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.24), where a negative result was defined as both tests negative, and this may be useful for ruling out disease. However, the confidence intervals around the pooled estimates are large, and in combination with the observed heterogeneity, suggest considerable uncertainty in these estimates.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^113pjymp]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines can promote higher-quality care, yet they are inconsistently adopted. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to discontinue routine screening urinalysis in children.

- **Methods**: Using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we employed a difference-in-differences approach to estimate visit-level screening urinalysis proportions before (2005–2006, n = 1,247) and after (2008–2009, n = 1,772) the 2007 AAP recommendation. We compared visits by children aged 4–18 years to visits by young adults aged 19–32. Analyses were adjusted for continuous patient age, patient race/ethnicity, physician specialty, and stratified by patient gender and visit setting.

- **Results**: The 2007 recommendation was associated with no significant change in adjusted visit-level screening urinalysis proportions in child visits (20.4% to 22.5%) compared to an increase in young adult visits (20.1% to 27.0%) — a differential impact of -4.8 percentage points (95% Confidence Interval [CI] -9.0, -0.5). In private practices, visit proportions differentially decreased by 7.6 percentage points (95% CI -13.7, -1.5) in female children and by 0.5 percentage points (95% CI -10.6, 9.6) in male children. In community health centers, visit proportions differentially decreased by 17.4 percentage points (95% CI -27.9, -6.8) in female children and by 33.5 percentage points (95% CI -47.4, -19.7) in male children.

- **Conclusions**: A 2007 recommendation to discontinue routine screening urinalysis in children was associated with:

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA/SUFU guideline (2025) [^115HdPpN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, particularly with respect to repeat urinalysis, the AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend reclassifying low or negligible-risk patients as intermediate or high-risk, based on findings of hematuria on repeat urinalysis. This reclassification should prompt a risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), particularly concerning diagnostic criteria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-UTI in patients with:

- **Indwelling catheters**: An indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization.

- **Symptoms**: Presence of symptoms or signs compatible with UTI with no other identified focus of infection.

- **Bacterial growth**: Growth of ≥ 10³ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose urethral, suprapubic, or condom catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.

### How Covid-19 changed the epidemiology of febrile urinary tract infections in children in the emergency department during the first outbreak [^115g7oSA]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) represents one of the most common bacterial infections in children and is a frequent cause for evaluation in the emergency department (ED). In the United States, the prevalence of UTI diagnosis in pediatric ED visits is about 0.43%. The highest incidence rate is reported during the first year of life, without significant differences between the genders.

A high percentage of children with UTIs is diagnosed in the ED. A study conducted in the United States between 2006 and 2011 reported that 1,904,379 children aged ≤ 17 years were evaluated in the ED for a first UTI. While most of these patients were discharged after starting treatment, 4.7% were hospitalized. This data reflects the content of many international guidelines regarding UTI, which recommend hospitalization only in specific clinical conditions.

Over the last few years, several American investigators have noted an increasing number of pediatric ED visits, and, meanwhile, the number of UTIs diagnosed in the ED has also risen.

In November 2019, the first cases of Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) were declared in Wuhan, China, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread throughout the world, causing more than 2 million deaths at the time of study data collection. SARS-CoV-2 spread across the Italian peninsula somewhat unevenly, with significant differences in viral spread detected between the various regions.

During the first Covid-19 pandemic, pediatric ED visits were reduced in the Italian and global context. Several reports demonstrated how the Covid-19 pandemic influenced the epidemiology of many adult conditions.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, especially in pediatric patients, the AAP 2016 guidelines recommend initiating treatment for a UTI either orally (PO) or parenterally, as both routes are equally efficacious. The choice of agent should be based on local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns, if available, and adjusted according to sensitivity testing of the isolated uropathogen.

### Hematuria in children due to schistosomiasis in a nonendemic setting [^114CHgNS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Infection with Schistosoma hematobium is common in immigrants from tropical Africa and often presents with painless hematuria. Since chronic and heavy infection can lead to significant morbidity, it is imperative for clinicians who serve the immigrant and refugee population to become familiar with this traditionally exotic disease. Increased awareness will allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment of infection, avoiding complications and minimizing expensive and invasive diagnostic procedures.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed.

Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection.

Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, or with hematuria persisting after treatment of a urinary tract infection, also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: A systematic review [^113wdRVB]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Thirteen studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to detect renal scarring.

- **Intravenous pyelography (IVP)**: Four studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of IVP; positive likelihood ratios were high (10.0 to 171.3), but the corresponding negative likelihood ratios were poor (0.15 to 0.80). Only one study included an appropriate patient spectrum, reporting a much lower positive likelihood ratio (10.0 compared to the next lowest of 58.8) and a higher negative likelihood ratio (0.80 compared to the next highest of 0.42) than the others.

- **Standard ultrasound techniques**: Seven studies evaluated standard ultrasound techniques. The performance characteristics varied greatly, with positive likelihood ratios generally ranging from moderate to high (1.3–35.9). Negative likelihood ratios showed poorer performance for ruling out scarring (0.14–0.99).

- **Indirect radionuclide cystography**: Three studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of this method. Positive likelihood ratios were moderate and ranged from 3.3 to 12.6, while negative likelihood ratios ranged from 0.15 to 0.63.

Sensitivity and specificity estimates for these studies are plotted in ROC space, as shown in Figure 4, for the detection of scarring using ultrasound.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: A systematic review [^111iW2Rd]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We assembled a database of published and unpublished literature from systematic searches of 16 electronic databases (from inception to between October 2002 and February 2003), hand searching of 12 journals, consultation with experts in the field, and screening bibliographies of included studies. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. There were no language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

We included controlled trials that compared different imaging strategies and reported patient-based outcomes. We also included diagnostic cohort studies with at least 20 children, some of whom were aged five years or under, that reported sufficient information to construct 2 × 2 tables. Table 1 presents a summary of the tests evaluated in this review and details the potential advantages that these tests have over the reference standards. Although other tests have been evaluated, this article will focus on those offering potential advantages over the reference standard. Studies had to compare one of the index tests listed in this table to the listed reference standard for each of the different aims.

### Blunt traumatic hematuria in children. Is a simplified algorithm justified [^111YBxih]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether radiographic evaluation is indicated in all children with traumatic hematuria.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of the records of 110 children, between the years 1992 and 1999, who were diagnosed with blunt trauma and hematuria. In our emergency department, it is routine practice to perform radiographic evaluations on all children with hematuria, regardless of the degree. Each chart was assessed for variables such as the mechanism of injury, degree of hematuria, presence of hypotension, details from imaging studies, renal injuries, renal anomalies, associated injuries, and outcomes.

- **Results**: We identified 110 patients aged 1 to 18 years (mean age 9). The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accidents, observed in 37 children (34%), followed by falls, which accounted for 32 cases (29%). Renal injuries were categorized from Grades I to V and were present in 24 patients: 5, 6, 6, 6, and 1 cases respectively, indicating a 22% occurrence of renal injury. Ureteropelvic junction avulsion was observed in 1 case (0.9%), while no child experienced renal pedicle injury. Incidentally, renal anomalies were detected in 9 patients. Of the 110 patients, 101 underwent radiographic evaluations, with computerized tomography applied in 97 cases (88%). Among the 24 patients with significant renal injury and all patients with incidentally diagnosed renal anomalies, urinalysis revealed 50 or more red blood cells per high power field. However, the patient with ureteropelvic junction avulsion presented without hematuria. Hypotension was noted in only 3 patients (2.7%), all of whom had associated injuries. Notably, 2 of these children also presented with renal injury. Associated injuries were identified in 11 out of 25 patients (44%).

The study aimed at assessing the necessity of radiographic evaluation in pediatric patients with blunt traumatic hematuria under various clinical presentations and injury conditions.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including post-surgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. To cover these pathogens, if intravenous antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management.

Multiple recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), defined by two or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Although reUTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and UTI prophylaxis. Girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, and fosfomycin. Empirical intravenous options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, intravenous amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine, and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^111PFbKX]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Our study offers evidence that a 2007 standardized practice guideline differentially impacted routine screening urinalysis use in children compared to adult ambulatory care visits. Differential impacts were noted across visit settings and patient genders. However, screening urinalysis use persisted in nearly a quarter of pediatric preventive care visits. More research is needed to understand why and how females and males are impacted differentially by screening guidelines, what differentiates practice settings, and why physicians do or do not discontinue screening tests once they are no longer recommended.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection: Does the evidence support aggressively pursuing the diagnosis [^112PDjC9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of pediatric fever has significantly changed over the past two decades, largely due to the development of vaccines against the most common bacterial pathogens causing bacteremia and meningitis. As the incidence of these two conditions decreases among vaccinated children, there is an increased focus on urinary tract infections as a potential source of hidden infections in febrile children. Emerging literature has raised questions about the degree and nature of the risks posed by urinary tract infections in nonverbal children, particularly when aggressive diagnosis efforts consume resources and lead to patient discomfort, medical risks, and potential overdiagnosis.

Our review of both early and emerging literature examines the utility and efficacy of early identification and treatment of urinary tract infections in children younger than 24 months. It concludes that in otherwise healthy children of this age, it may be reasonable to withhold or delay testing for urinary tract infections if signs of other infection sources are apparent or if the fever has been present for fewer than 4 to 5 days.

### Urinary tract infection: new perspectives on a common disease [^116cS3w4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is an important cause of morbidity in children and affects up to 10% of the childhood population. Recent information suggests that the long-term outcome for children with urinary tract infections is much better than previously believed, with causal links to end-stage renal disease and hypertension not demonstrated despite 20-year cohort studies. Improvements in the use of dipstick and clinical features as diagnostic tools have occurred. However, culture is still needed if the diagnosis of urinary tract infection is to be definitively established. Interventions to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, particularly low-dose, long-term antimicrobial agents, may not be effective, and placebo-controlled trials are now required.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^1126CRh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics. Whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^113rJs4s]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

This analysis included preventive care visits from two time periods (2005–2006 and 2008–2009) involving two age groups: children aged 4–18 years and young adults aged 19–32 years. Overall, we analyzed 3,019 preventive care visits, with 1,247 visits from 2005–2006 and 1,772 visits from 2008–2009.

Before 2007, a majority of child and adult visits occurred in the private practice setting (95.6% and 97.3%, respectively). Most pediatric visits (75.7%) were to pediatricians, while most visits by young adults (93.7%) were to family medicine practitioners. Notably, female patients constituted the majority of young adult visits (71.1%).

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Patient history and clinical review underpin the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) and assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D). Urine collection should be done by clean catch, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration. Urine analysis, culture, and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C). Additional blood investigations for complicated UTI (cUTI) may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine, and electrolytes (GRADE C). An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D). All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D). Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is an inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or cUTI, need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis. Key investigations and their interpretation are outlined below.

- **Urine collection methods**: As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration being the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under 2 months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples; therefore, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised. Specimens collected via a urine bag with positive findings may not be reliable.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: The diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^116Ciijs]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

The AAP 2016 guidelines provide specific recommendations regarding the evaluation of acute cystitis in pediatric patients. In the case of a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever, where immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required, it is important to assess the likelihood of a urinary tract infection (UTI) to guide further decisions.

- **Situation: Low risk**: Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only, without testing.

- **Situation: Non-low risk, first option**: Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis.

- **Situation: Non-low risk, second option**:
	- Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis.
	- If urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria), obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture.
	- Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.

### Serum soluble ST2 as a marker of renal scar in pediatric upper urinary tract infection [^114CBDHy]. Cytokine (2019). Low credibility.

Upper urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in childhood. Patients with this condition are at risk for renal scarring, which can lead to complications such as hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive renal failure. However, predictive biomarkers of renal scarring in children with upper urinary tract infection remain unidentified. This study evaluates whether soluble ST2 levels may serve as biomarkers for subsequent renal scarring in these patients.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: We retrospectively studied pediatric patients with upper urinary tract infection at a tertiary center. Twenty-eight children were assessed — 14 with renal scarring and 14 without — using 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid imaging. Additionally, 13 control subjects were enrolled. The clinical data and serum cytokine levels, including soluble ST2 levels, were compared between those with and without renal scars.

- **Results**: Serum soluble ST2 levels were significantly higher in the scar group compared to the non-scar group. No significant differences were observed in the levels of serum interferon-γ, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, and transforming growth factor-β between the groups. The area under the curve for differentiating between the non-scar and scar groups based on serum soluble ST2 measurements was 0.79, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 64.3%.

### Dysuria: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^111Gwqad]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Dysuria, a sensation of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infections but can also result from sexually transmitted infections, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. A detailed patient history is crucial for identifying signs of sexually transmitted infections, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should undergo urinalysis. A urine culture should be conducted to confirm infection and guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially when a complicated urinary tract infection is suspected.

The presence of vaginal discharge reduces the likelihood of a urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, such as cervicitis, should be considered. If a patient experiences persistent urethritis or cervicitis despite negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may enhance diagnosis accuracy with or without laboratory analysis. Evaluating and treating dysuria through virtual encounters without laboratory testing can increase symptoms and the number of antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment necessitate further investigation for both infectious and noninfectious causes.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^11797t3a]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, imaging, and conservative management of urinary tract infections based on the peer-reviewed literature of the last year.

- **Recent findings**: It has been estimated that 3% of prepubertal girls and 1% of prepubertal boys are diagnosed with urinary tract infections. Breastfeeding has been shown to offer significant protection against urinary tract infection in infants. Any young child with acute pyelonephritis should be evaluated by a dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to confirm or rule out renal scarring. The voiding cystourethrogram can be performed within the first 7 days of diagnosis. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporin are the first-line antibiotics to treat children with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

- **Summary**: The incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy and childhood is high and influenced by the age and sex of the patient. Voiding cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan are required for imaging. Short-course treatment is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.

Ganglioneuromas are rare benign tumors arising from neural crest cells of the autonomic nervous system. These tumors may rarely localize to the bladder, and few cases have been reported in the adult literature. At the time of writing, however, bladder ganglioneuromas have not been reported in the pediatric literature. We report the case of a 5-year-old girl who presented with hematuria and a urinary tract infection and, on workup, was found to have a large bladder mass. Transurethral resection and pathologic examination revealed the mass to be a ganglioneuroma. The case is presented followed by a brief review of the literature.

Based on their final diagnosis, each patient was assigned to one of the seven final diagnosis categories. For statistical purposes, these categories were split into non-life threatening (NLT) or life threatening (LT) groups. BPE denotes benign prostate enlargement, MI indicates muscle invasive, and NMI represents non-muscle invasive. TCC is transitional cell carcinoma, UC is urothelial cancer, and UTI stands for urinary tract infection.

### Red urine, updated for the nephrologist: a case report [^1126fbVR]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in young adults requires a complete work-up, including renal imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, cystoscopy, and microbiological tests to rule out renal obstruction, kidney stones, renal infarction, schistosomiasis, other infections, toxic/herbal consumption, and urological tumors. Renal biopsy is then often needed to explore glomerulopathies such as IgA nephropathy.

The prevalence of the sickle cell trait in the African black population is between 20 and 40%. Although it is often asymptomatic, it can be responsible for specific renal abnormalities. Half of the cases of hematuria are due to renal papillary necrosis, although renal obstruction, urinary infection, kidney stones, renal infarction, papillary necrosis, schistosomiasis, and urological tumors such as renal medullary carcinoma must be ruled out.

Only a few cases of sickle cell trait and gross hematuria have been described. We describe here a case of gross hematuria in a patient with unknown sickle cell trait that we feel should be brought to the attention of nephrologists.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations where antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Pediatric genitourinary infections and other considerations [^113axFCi]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients pose a unique host of challenges to the emergency provider across all complaints and ages, particularly notable in the genitourinary (GU) system. The pediatric GU system is different from that of the adult in its etiology of symptoms, complications, and treatments. Based on age, there are variations in the anatomy. These differences result in symptoms and diagnoses that must be managed differently. Although in many respects, management is similar to GU emergency conditions in adults, there are, occasionally subtle, differences between the care of children and adults, which can greatly impact outcomes.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^116doJUG]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, with girls being at a significantly higher risk compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli. The collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with their first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTIs.

Most children with a first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; this procedure may be considered after the first UTI in children with an abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination, or a UTI caused by an atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux following a UTI require surgical correction.

The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### Association between hyponatremia and disease severity in pediatric urinary tract infections [^112NMybt]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in pediatrics. It has been found that around 8% of girls and 2% of boys will have experienced UTI by the age of 7 years old. UTI can be further classified into upper UTI (pyelonephritis and ureteritis) and lower UTI (cystitis and urethritis). When the urinary tract is infected by bacteria, the patient may present with asymptomatic bacteriuria, lower urinary tract infection symptoms or signs, or acute pyelonephritis (APN) in a minority of patients due to renal parenchymal involvement. UTI patients admitted to the pediatric ward usually have more severe clinical presentations compared to those treated in outpatient settings. Therefore, among these patients, identifying additional markers that can predict disease severity and the likelihood of developing APN could be beneficial. Factors proposed by previous studies include fever peak > 39 °C, procalcitonin (PCT) level, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and abnormal renal and urinary bladder sonography findings.

A more interesting, but rarely discussed marker, is hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mmol/l). Hyponatremia is a very common electrolyte disorder and has been reported to occur frequently in children with pneumonia, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and Kawasaki disease. Hyponatremia has been noted to be associated with longer hospitalization and more severe outcomes in various infections. A few studies in the past have suggested hyponatremia to be associated with APN or reflect more severe inflammation in children with febrile UTI.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^114r1D75]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). High credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical examination, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a non-genitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: A systematic review [^115zryJw]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

A test predicting the risk of renal scarring would be useful were a treatment available to prevent its development. Anti-microbial therapy is usually initiated in children with confirmed UTI prior to investigation, as there is some evidence that treatment delay may affect scarring. Predicting the risk of renal scarring as a result of an infection would, therefore, appear to be of academic interest alone. We identified no acute tests that were able to accurately predict the development of renal scarring. The prediction of the risk of future infection is of potential interest in guiding the initiation of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, but is outside the scope of this paper.

Although the presence of renal scarring represents the initial stages of renal disease, there is little that can be done to treat patients with scarring to prevent complications. If progressive scarring is assumed to be the consequence of repeat infections, then anti-microbial prophylaxis may be initiated, although the effectiveness of this strategy remains open to debate.

Imaging for the detection of renal scarring may be seen as a means of monitoring disease progression. If repeat examination is required, then a less invasive alternative to the reference standard (renal scintigraphy), and one which avoids the use of ionising radiation, would seem particularly desirable. We found standard ultrasound examination to be a potentially useful test for ruling in scarring, but poor for ruling it out. This fits with anecdotal opinion that ultrasound is good at identifying gross scarring but poor at detecting finer scarring details.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in urinary tract infection diagnosis [^111zVyMW]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary infections are a common pediatric disease, and their treatment and prognosis are closely correlated with infection location. Common clinical manifestations and laboratory indices are insufficient for differentiating acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). Distinguishing between these diseases is particularly challenging for infants and children, yet it is necessary because pyelonephritis poses a risk of renal parenchyma involvement. This can lead to renal scar formation, high blood pressure, and end-stage renal failure in adults. Smellie et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 52 patients with new or progressive renal scars and revealed that 50 of these patients had a medical history of urinary infection diagnosis or treatment delay. Therefore, finding a technically easy and practical method for differentiating between upper and lower UTIs is urgently required.

As of this writing, 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is a commonly adopted method for diagnosing the severity of renal involvement and pyelonephritis. However, this method is costly and is radioactive to sick children. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a type of hormonal activity-free calcitonin precursor protein that can serve as an early diagnosis index of serious bacterial infections and septicemia; PCT is also correlated with the severity of bacterial infections. PCT is a satisfactory predictor of renal parenchymal involvement in acute and late renal scars.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^112z2pwe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**: The definition of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is most usefully described as a UTI in children with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D). Children with cUTI may have one or more of the following:

- **Localized risk**: Significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality and multiple reUTI.
- **Generalized risk**: Neonates and non-urological underlying conditions (both renal and non-renal).
- **Severe clinical presentations**: Sepsis and severe renal parenchymal disease.

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple UTI syndromes with additional characteristics that could complicate the usual UTI course. This includes severe clinical presentations, with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or underlying conditions, and unusual pathogen properties. This diversity makes it challenging to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for managing cUTI. Traditionally, UTI has been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants. However, due to the absence of specific and clearly defined criteria from the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous.

In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both, or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates and most children.

### Pediatric urine testing [^112uhHoH]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and obtained noninvasively, urine testing is well suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes and also less common tests used for diagnosing specific disorders. Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are addressed. Some simple tests that are underused by clinicians are mentioned, as are some exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^112DCgL4]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The observed differential decrease in pediatric screening urinalysis in our study was consistent with the observed impact of another recently discontinued preventive care practice. In 2008, the USPSTF recommended discontinuation in older men of prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen test, which was shown to result in a small but significant impact on screening. Unfortunately, discontinued routine child preventive care screening tests are not common, so comparison in the pediatric population is difficult.

Our stratified analyses by visit setting and patient gender also revealed differential impacts. We observed consistently larger differential decreases in screening urinalysis proportions in the community health center setting than in the private practice setting for both genders. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating comparable or higher quality care delivery in community health center settings compared to other settings. Community health centers have also been shown to provide cost-effective care, which could make it more likely that community health center practitioners would more rapidly discontinue a procedure such as urinalysis (which can be time-intensive and minimally revenue-generating) once it was no longer recommended. Our gender-stratified results were mixed and thus more difficult to interpret; while urinalysis in female child visits differentially decreased in both settings, in male visits we observed a large differential decrease in the community health center setting compared to no change in the private practice.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in urinary tract infection diagnosis [^116fw8L9]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary infections are a common type of pediatric disease, and their treatment and prognosis are closely correlated with infection location. Common clinical manifestations and laboratory tests are insufficient to differentiate between acute pyelonephritis and lower urinary tract infection. This study was conducted to explore a diagnostic method for upper and lower urinary tract infection differentiation.

- **Methods**: The diagnostic values of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic curve method for upper and lower urinary tract infection differentiation. PCT was determined using a chemiluminescent immunoassay.

- **Results**: The PCT and CRP values in children with acute pyelonephritis were significantly higher than those in children with lower urinary tract infection (3.90 ± 3.51 ng/ml and 68.17 ± 39.42 mg/l vs. 0.48 ± 0.39 ng/ml and 21.39 ± 14.92 mg/l, respectively). The PCT values were correlated with the degree of renal involvement, whereas the CRP values failed to show such a significant correlation. PCT had a sensitivity of 90.47% and a specificity of 88% in predicting nephropathia, whereas CRP had a sensitivity of 85.71% and a specificity of 48%.

- **Conclusions**: Both PCT and CRP can be used for upper and lower urinary tract infection differentiation, but PCT has higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting pyelonephritis than CRP. PCT showed better results than CRP. PCT values were also correlated with the degree of renal involvement.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^1153d2HR]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Standardized practice guidelines developed by professional societies and other health entities can help physicians make informed decisions about the appropriate use of preventive services. Yet, physicians who care for children, like many physicians, inconsistently utilize preventive care guidelines. Attention to evaluating the quality of pediatric preventive care has been growing, and many previous studies have examined whether recommended services are being delivered to children. Less attention has been devoted to evaluating whether services that are no longer recommended are being discontinued.

Recommendations regarding routine urine screening for the detection of renal or urologic disease in children have evolved over several decades. In both 1977 and 1991, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended routine urine screening at four time points during childhood. Revised health supervision guidelines in 1995 and 2000 limited screening to only two age groups: five-year-olds and sexually active adolescents.

Accumulated evidence now suggests that although inexpensive, screening urinalysis is a poor screening test for disease. It can lead to false positives and associated costly and invasive diagnostic evaluations, and there is limited evidence to suggest detection of abnormalities in childhood improves long-term outcomes. In light of the lack of clear benefit associated with screening urinalysis relative to its associated costs and risks, the AAP in 2007 removed routine screening urinalysis for asymptomatic children and adolescents from its health supervision guidelines.

### Rapid tests and urine sampling techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: A systematic review [^115CCwfn]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common sources of infection in children under 5. In a small proportion of children, UTI may lead to renal scarring. This outcome is of concern as it is associated with significant future complications, ultimately leading to end-stage renal disease. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is therefore important to reduce the risk of future scarring.

The clinical history and examination is the first step in any diagnosis and is the means of identifying children with suspected UTI. Elements of the clinical examination have also been evaluated as diagnostic tests for UTI, but there is little data available on these. Urine tests are commonly used for the diagnosis of UTI.

The reference standard for the diagnosis of UTI in children is considered to be any bacterial growth on a culture of urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Culture has the disadvantage of taking at least 48 hours to give a result. More rapid methods of UTI diagnosis are therefore desirable. The most widely used rapid tests are dipsticks. Analytes commonly tested by dipsticks include leukocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, and protein. Dipstick tests have the advantage of being quick and easy to perform, and can be carried out in primary care, giving an immediate result. Microscopic examination of urine samples for leukocytes or bacteria is considerably more time-consuming and labor-intensive than the dipstick method. However, unlike culture, it can be used to give results within the primary care setting. An uncontaminated sample is necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in urinary tract infection diagnosis [^111CtN59]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary infections are a common type of pediatric disease, and their treatment and prognosis are closely associated with the infection position. Differentiating acute pyelonephritis (APN) from lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is difficult based on common clinical manifestations and laboratory indices; thus, an easier and more practical method is necessary. 99m Tc-DMSA scintigraphy is currently a commonly adopted method for diagnosing the degree of renal involvement and pyelonephritis; however, this method is costly and exposes children to radiation.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a hormonal activity-free calcitonin precursor protein. Studies have proven that PCT serves as an early diagnostic index for bacterial infections and septicemia and is also correlated with the severity of bacterial infections. Thus, PCT can predict prognosis. Normally, PCT does not increase when a local bacterial infection occurs unless accompanied by systemic inflammatory reactions.

Most authors conclude that PCT has satisfactory diagnostic accuracy and significant clinical value for APN, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 70% to 100% and 70% to 97%, respectively, across studies and thresholds. However, a Belgian team found lower sensitivity and specificity (68% and 23%, respectively), with no obvious difference regarding the cutoff of the characteristics of the population. The average PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of children with APN were significantly higher than those of children with lower UTI (P < 0.01). In contrast, peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts were not significant in predicting renal involvement.

### Should the absence of urinary nitrite influence empiric antibiotics for urinary tract infection in young children [^114FRGep]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Screening for urinary tract infection (UTI) includes urinary nitrite testing by dipstick urinalysis. Gram-negative enteric organisms produce urinary nitrite and represent the most common uropathogens. Enterococcus, a less common uropathogen, does not produce nitrite and has a unique antibiotic resistance pattern. Whether to adjust empiric antibiotics in the absence of urinary nitrite has not been established. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of enterococcal UTI among young children with a nitrite negative urinalysis.

A retrospective study of children aged less than 2 years evaluated in the emergency department for possible UTI and had a paired urinalysis and urine culture was performed. Urinary tract infection was defined by catheterized culture yielding greater than or equal to 50,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single uropathogen. The prevalence of uropathogens among nitrite negative samples was studied.

A total of 7599 children were studied. The median (interquartile range) age was 5.6 (2.3–11.2) months, and 57% were female. The prevalence of UTI was 8.1%. Enterococcus was the uropathogen in 2.1% of UTIs, and all cases had negative dipstick nitrite. Among nitrite negative UTIs, 95.6% of uropathogens were gram-negative and only 3.2% (confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) were Enterococcus. None of the 200 UTIs with positive nitrite yielded Enterococcus (upper confidence interval, 1.4%). Among children with positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite, only 0.7% of cases had enterococcal UTI.

Only 3% of nitrite-negative samples contained Enterococcus, indicating that the absence of urinary nitrite may not necessitate a change in empiric antibiotics for UTIs in young children.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^115tDnN2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infections are common and have been recognized as a source of acute morbidity and long-term medical consequences in adulthood. There are various risk factors and clinical presentations in children with urinary tract infections. The main objectives in management include prompt diagnosis, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, identification of anatomic anomalies, and, in select patients, long-term follow-up.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^116BWiqW]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection in the pediatric population can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly and appropriately. All first infections may signify possible underlying anatomic or functional abnormalities and require imaging of the lower and upper tracts. Accurate diagnosis of UTIs requires a properly collected quantitative urine culture.

Treatment should be tailored to the pathogen as dictated by the urine culture sensitivities to minimize the development of multidrug-resistant organisms. Prophylactic agents should differ from the antibiotic used in the acute setting and should preferably be concentrated in the urinary tract, with minimal effects on the normal fecal flora.

In the long term, patients with documented evidence of renal scarring should be followed up for signs of renal deterioration and hypertension.

### Hematuria in children [^112iqPgs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Children with hematuria require a thorough history and physical examination. Not all children with hematuria require the same investigations. The only laboratory test uniformly required for children with the various presentations of hematuria is a complete urinalysis with a microscopic examination. The rest of the evaluation is tailored according to the pertinent history, physical examination, and other abnormalities on the urinalysis.

This article provides a brief summary of the more common causes of pediatric hematuria and suggests how to tailor the patient's evaluation according to the presentation. Most causes of hematuria in pediatrics represent medical conditions that often require referral to a pediatric nephrologist. Indications for referral to a urologist are more limited and include stones that do not pass spontaneously or are more than 5 mm in diameter, renal injury from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, or gross hematuria that seems to originate from the urinary tract without an identified cause.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, particularly concerning urinalysis, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining urinalysis in patients with dysuria. This procedure is essential to determine the cause, especially in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), when there is suspicion of complicated UTI, and to prevent repeat encounters and repeat courses of antibiotics.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors: urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors, such as tumors, may be life-threatening, thus prompt and thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with a computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography, or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity but an extremely high specificity, making it a useful tool in following patients with high-grade cancers. Furthermore, the interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the presence of conditions such as urinary tract infections. With these notable limitations, the question arises: how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology in patients presenting to a urology clinic for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Pediatric screening urinalysis: A difference-in-differences analysis of how a 2007 change in guidelines impacted use [^113RHMVH]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In the two-year periods before and after the 2007 recommendation to discontinue routine screening urinalysis in children, we observed no change in screening urinalysis use in child visits. In adult visits, screening urinalysis rates rose, resulting in a differential decrease in child visits of nearly 5 percentage points. Our stratified analyses, based on visit setting and patient gender, also revealed differential impacts in child visits compared to young adult visits. Overall, screening urinalysis use persisted in nearly a quarter of pediatric preventive care visits after 2007.

The increase in urinalyses observed in adult visits could be explained by several factors. A change in adult guidelines could lead to an increase in the proportion of adult visits including screening urinalysis. However, at no time during the study period was universal screening urinalysis recommended by major adult preventive care guidelines developers such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) or the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), making this explanation less likely. Another possibility could be attributed to an increase in adult visits by subgroups for whom urinalysis may be an appropriate screening test, such as pregnant women or patients with diabetes, kidney disease, or hypertension. Similarly, routine urine chlamydia tests could have been misclassified as urinalyses. However, we did not anticipate significant differences in the proportions of these subgroups visiting physicians in either age group in the short period before or after the AAP recommendation.
