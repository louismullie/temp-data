## Question

Bipolar anxiety treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating anxiety in bipolar disorder, preserving the step-by-step thinking and self-verification process. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and prevalence of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment principle of mood stabilization first. Next, I will examine first-line pharmacologic strategies with anxiolytic signals, followed by second-line and adjunctive options. After that, I need to review psychotherapeutic approaches, especially CBT and MBCT, and their evidence strength. I will then consider special populations and monitoring needs, and finally synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with explicit cautions and shared decision-making elements, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or conflicting [^111Lnvo5] [^111LK8VM] [^114L6B9K].

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance and prevalence of anxiety in bipolar disorder, because this frames risk and urgency. Comorbid anxiety disorders occur in roughly 45% of individuals with bipolar disorder across epidemiologic samples, representing a threefold increase versus the general population, and are associated with earlier age of onset, more depressive episodes, rapid cycling, suicidality, and poorer functional outcomes, so I need to ensure anxiety is screened and treated proactively rather than as an afterthought [^111Lnvo5] [^111LK8VM] [^115Qx19D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating anxiety directly; I should confirm the foundational principle that mood stabilization comes first. Guidelines consistently recommend a stepwise approach prioritizing stabilization of bipolar symptoms before targeting anxiety specifically, because untreated bipolar disorder and antidepressant exposure can worsen anxiety and precipitate mood switching, and anxiety often improves as mood stabilizes; thus, I need to check that any anxiety-directed interventions are layered onto a solid mood-stabilizing foundation [^111LK8VM] [^114RoQaS].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic options with credible anxiolytic signals in bipolar disorder, and I need to be careful about the strength of evidence. Quetiapine has the most consistent signal, with RCTs and pooled analyses showing improvement in anxiety symptoms during bipolar depression and maintenance benefits; CANMAT/ISBD place quetiapine as first-line for bipolar depression and note anxiolytic effects, and the VA/DoD guideline acknowledges possible benefit for comorbid anxiety, though it does not elevate pharmacotherapy to a strong recommendation for residual anxiety, so I should frame quetiapine as a reasonable first choice when anxiety co-occurs with bipolar depression or maintenance needs are broad [^113BJEUf] [^111YKXKv] [^116dsJMC]. Lurasidone also shows anxiolytic signals in bipolar depression and in MDD with mixed features, and is first-line for bipolar depression, making it another solid option when anxiety is prominent, though I should confirm tolerability and metabolic profiles in shared decision-making [^113BJEUf] [^115m8nwC]. Lamotrigine is less robust for acute anxiety but may help residual anxiety in predominantly depressive or anxious phenotypes and is reasonable in maintenance, particularly when mania risk is lower, so I should match it to polarity and comorbidity patterns [^113kAhD7] [^113BJEUf] [^114oQq4h].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antidepressants because this is a common pitfall. Antidepressants can be used cautiously only as adjuncts to mood stabilizers in carefully selected patients with pure, non-mixed bipolar depression and no history of antidepressant-induced mania, and even then the effect size is small; they are not first-line and should be avoided in mixed features or rapid cycling, so I need to ensure informed consent and close monitoring for switching if they are used at all [^111Vz1W6] [^112Sg7Jd].

> I will now examine second-line and adjunctive pharmacologic strategies, keeping an eye on limited but plausible options. Gabapentin lacks antimanic efficacy but has open-label and anxiety-disorder evidence suggesting benefit for anxiety symptoms and may aid alcohol avoidance; given a benign profile, it can be considered as an adjunct in euthymic patients with persistent anxiety after mood stabilization, though I should confirm expectations and monitor for sedation [^113kAhD7] [^115PxsZk]. Benzodiazepines can be used short-term at the lowest effective dose for acute anxiety relief, but I need to emphasize dependence, overdose risk, and lack of disease-modifying benefit; they are not maintenance solutions and should be time-limited with a clear exit plan [^111LK8VM] [^1126f13Y]. For OCD comorbidity, risperidone or olanzapine augmentation has evidence in SSRI-refractory OCD, but I should double-check bipolar-specific data and balance switch risk when considering antipsychotic augmentation for OCD in bipolar disorder [^117UUdAi] [^113kAhD7].

> Let me consider psychotherapeutic approaches, since residual anxiety in remitted or partially remitted bipolar disorder is common and pharmacologic effects are modest. CBT is the most consistently supported modality for residual anxiety in bipolar disorder; the VA/DoD issues a weak-for recommendation to offer CBT for residual anxiety, supported by systematic review data showing reductions in anxiety compared with control conditions, so I should prioritize CBT access and consider transdiagnostic or BD-adapted protocols when available [^114L6B9K] [^116dsJMC] [^114hLKod]. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy shows mixed results; some trials suggest anxiety improvements while a recent multicenter RCT did not show superiority to treatment-as-usual for depressive symptoms and had nuanced anxiety findings, so I should present MBCT as a patient-preference option with modest evidence rather than a first-line substitute for CBT [^112NRbF5] [^114hLKod]. Psychoeducation remains foundational for adherence and relapse prevention and should be offered to all patients, with family involvement when feasible, as part of comprehensive care [^113K9kG9].

> But wait, what if the patient is in an acute mood episode; should I treat anxiety directly or stabilize mood first? I should confirm that during acute mania or mixed states, the priority is antimanic treatment and removal of destabilizing agents like antidepressants or stimulants; anxiety typically abates with mood stabilization, so layering anxiolytics prematurely risks obscuring the clinical course and may be unsafe in mixed presentations with high suicidality risk [^116gW6b1] [^1126f13Y]. In acute bipolar depression with prominent anxiety, quetiapine or lurasidone are reasonable first-line choices that address both mood and anxiety symptoms, and I should reassess anxiety after initial mood improvement before adding anxiety-specific agents [^111YKXKv] [^113BJEUf].

> Next, I should review special populations and monitoring requirements to avoid missing safety issues. In older adults, I need to weigh antipsychotic metabolic and cerebrovascular risks; lithium or lamotrigine may be preferred initially, with careful dosing and monitoring, and quetiapine or lurasidone considered when benefits outweigh risks and when anxiety is prominent, ensuring shared decision-making about trade-offs [^113MpQnK]. In pregnancy and reproductive-age patients, I should confirm teratogenic risks with valproate and lamotrigine's favorable reproductive profile, and coordinate preconception planning; benzodiazepines carry risks and should be minimized, with nonpharmacologic anxiety strategies emphasized [^notfound]. Across all patients, I need to ensure routine metabolic monitoring with atypical antipsychotics, suicide risk assessment given the elevated risk with comorbid anxiety, and medication level checks where relevant, such as lithium and valproate, to optimize efficacy and safety [^112AeX3a] [^1126f13Y] [^115Qx19D] [^1136YV3R].

> I should double-check the strength of pharmacologic evidence for anxiety per se, because expectations need to be calibrated. A meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled RCTs found only a small overall anxiolytic effect of medications, primarily atypical antipsychotics, with good acceptability, reinforcing that medications can help but gains are modest and that psychotherapy and functional recovery strategies are essential parts of care [^114rnnUR]. This aligns with the VA/DoD's preference for CBT in residual anxiety and the general guideline emphasis on combined treatment rather than pharmacologic monotherapy for comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder [^114L6B9K] [^111LK8VM].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm, and I will verify each step against guidelines before concluding. First, stabilize bipolar disorder with an evidence-based mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, selecting quetiapine or lurasidone if anxiety is prominent during depression, and reassess anxiety after mood stabilization; avoid antidepressant monotherapy and remove destabilizing agents in mixed states, documenting rationale and risks [^111YKXKv] [^113BJEUf] [^112Sg7Jd]. Second, if residual anxiety persists in partial or full remission, offer CBT as first-line psychotherapy, with MBCT as an alternative based on patient preference and availability, and set expectations about modest but meaningful benefits [^114L6B9K] [^114hLKod]. Third, consider adjunctive pharmacotherapy for persistent, impairing anxiety after these steps, such as gabapentin in euthymic patients or carefully selected benzodiazepines short-term, while monitoring closely for misuse, sedation, and withdrawal; reserve antidepressant augmentation only for carefully selected, pure bipolar depression with informed consent and switch monitoring plans [^113kAhD7] [^111LK8VM] [^111Vz1W6]. Fourth, integrate psychoeducation, sleep and circadian rhythm stabilization, and substance use treatment as indicated, and use shared decision-making to align choices with patient values, side-effect tolerance, and functional goals [^113K9kG9] [^111YAcCH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought risperidone had strong evidence for anxiety in bipolar disorder, but I should correct that impression. A randomized trial of risperidone monotherapy in bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder or GAD failed to separate from placebo on anxiety outcomes, so I should not position risperidone as an anxiolytic strategy in bipolar disorder despite occasional off-label use, and I will avoid overinterpreting open-label or heterogeneous data in this context [^114Jixu1].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and iterative adjustments are built into the plan. I should track mood and anxiety longitudinally, assess adherence systematically, and adjust the regimen based on early response or nonresponse, recognizing that lack of early improvement by about 2 weeks predicts poorer outcomes and should prompt optimization or switching rather than indefinite waiting; this iterative, measurement-based approach is consistent with chronic disease management principles for bipolar disorder and helps mitigate the high recurrence risk associated with comorbid anxiety [^111wCovR] [^111YAcCH] [^112N3zZB].

Treat bipolar anxiety by **stabilizing mood first** with lithium, valproate, or atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) [^116kji8X] [^111YKXKv], as these agents also reduce anxiety [^114rnnUR]. Use **CBT as first-line psychotherapy** for residual anxiety [^114L6B9K] [^114hLKod], and reserve benzodiazepines for short-term use only due to dependence and switch risk [^111LK8VM]. Avoid antidepressant monotherapy because of mania risk; if needed, use only with a mood stabilizer and close monitoring [^111Vz1W6] [^112Sg7Jd]. Monitor for mood switching, substance use, and adherence, and adjust treatment based on response and side effects [^112AeX3a] [^113K9kG9].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Mood stabilizers

- **Lithium**: Effective for mood stabilization and may reduce anxiety symptoms; monitor for toxicity and renal/thyroid effects [^116kji8X].

- **Valproate**: Useful for anxiety, particularly in mixed states; monitor for hepatic and hematologic effects [^117VsvZq].

- **Lamotrigine**: Effective for depressive symptoms and anxiety; slow titration required to avoid rash [^115m8nwC].

---

### Atypical antipsychotics

- **Quetiapine**: Strong evidence for anxiety reduction in bipolar depression; monitor metabolic effects [^113BJEUf] [^112AeX3a].

- **Lurasidone**: Effective for anxiety symptoms in bipolar depression; favorable metabolic profile [^notfound].

- **Olanzapine**: Effective for anxiety but high metabolic risk; use cautiously [^113kAhD7].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are for **short-term use only** due to dependence and switch risk; avoid alprazolam because of higher switch risk [^111LK8VM] [^1164V6N3].

---

### Antidepressants

Avoid **antidepressant monotherapy** because of mania risk; if needed, use with a mood stabilizer and monitor closely [^111Vz1W6] [^112Sg7Jd].

---

## Psychotherapeutic interventions

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: First-line for residual anxiety in remitted patients; reduces anxiety and improves functioning [^114L6B9K] [^114hLKod].

- **Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)**: Promising for anxiety and relapse prevention; more research needed [^116dsJMC] [^1168jtzn].

- **Psychoeducation**: Essential for adherence and relapse prevention; include family when possible [^113K9kG9].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Mood switching**: Monitor for antidepressant-induced mania/hypomania [^111Vz1W6].

- **Substance use**: Common and worsens outcomes; address concurrently [^113zPRyU].

- **Adherence**: Nonadherence increases relapse; use psychoeducation and simplify regimens [^113K9kG9].

- **Side effects**: Monitor metabolic, neurologic, and psychiatric adverse effects [^112AeX3a].

1 INTRODUCTION

In the 20 years since the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) first published guidelines on the management of BD (BD), 1 there has been an explosion of research on treatment of this illness. During this time period, CANMAT has strived to translate advances in research into international consensus on evidence‐based clinical management; first by publishing 2005 guidelines accompanied by expert commentaries, then by providing updates in 2007, 2 2009 3 and 2013 4 in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). The main objective of these publications was to synthesize the wealth of evidence on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the range of interventions available for this complex and varied illness, with the goal of providing clear, easy to use recommendations for clinicians to improve outcomes in their patients.

Given that 13 years have elapsed since the publication of the last full edition in 2005, the objective of these 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Disorder Management Guidelines is to provide a comprehensive, up‐to‐date review of research evidence on the treatment of various phases of BD, translated into clinical recommendations for evidence‐based management. Updated principles related to diagnosis and management are also included, in response to significant changes made in the 5 th edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM‐5). 5 With increased research into various treatments for BD, the evidence ratings have also been modified to increase rigor; for instance, minimum sample sizes are now specified for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at each level of evidence (Table 1).

Definitions for level of evidence ratings

As with previous editions of CANMAT guidelines, clinical support for efficacy was an important consideration in arriving at the final treatment recommendations (Table 2). Major conflicting data are addressed in blue text boxes (figures) to clarify the rationale for arriving at a specific level of evidence for efficacy.

Anxiety disorders

Patients with BD frequently experience symptoms of anxiety and comorbid anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and others). Clinical samples indicate that 24%‐56% of patients with BD meet criteria for one or more anxiety disorders, with the highest rates in women. 720 Comorbid anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are associated with a higher number of mood episodes and depressive symptoms, including suicidality and sleep disturbance, and greater impairment of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. 721 The presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder is also associated with high rates of use of antidepressants, 722 which should be employed with caution due to their potential for mood destabilization (Section 4).

While the CANMAT Task Force report 720 described key studies and treatment recommendations in length, those recommendations have been updated below. However, it remains the case that there are few studies that have focused exclusively on anxiety symptoms or disorders comorbid with BD, whether for treatment efficacy or safety. While there are treatment options, the limitations resulting from a paucity of data prevent the development of clear guidelines or treatment algorithms.

A "step‐wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety. In general, mood stabilization is the priority before specific anxiety treatments are considered (Figure 9). Despite clinical experience, antidepressants, particularly serotoninergic agents, should be employed with caution due to their potential to provoke mood destabilization. While benzodiazepines are an important clinical tool because they can rapidly alleviate anxiety, clinicians should strive to prescribe them at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period possible, given the concerns about suicide risk, abuse and dependence. CBT continues to be an appropriate first‐line treatment for anxiety.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: consensus and controversies [^1174WYc5]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Since the previous publication of Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines in 1997, there has been a substantial increase in evidence-based treatment options for bipolar disorder. The present guidelines review the new evidence and use criteria to rate strength of evidence and incorporate effectiveness, safety, and tolerability data to determine global clinical recommendations for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. The guidelines suggest that although pharmacotherapy forms the cornerstone of management, utilization of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and incorporation of chronic disease management model involving a healthcare team are required in providing optimal management for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatments for acute mania. Bipolar depression and mixed states are frequently associated with suicidal acts; therefore assessment for suicide should always be an integral part of managing any bipolar patient. Lithium, lamotrigine or various combinations of antidepressant and mood-stabilizing agents are first-line treatments for bipolar depression. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. Historical and symptom profiles help with treatment selection. With the growing recognition of bipolar II disorders, it is anticipated that a larger body of evidence will become available to guide treatment of this common and disabling condition. These guidelines also discuss issues related to bipolar disorder in women and those with comorbidity and include a section on safety and monitoring.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116kji8X]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first, second, and third- line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second- line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.

### Effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions on anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission: a systematic review [^114hLKod]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) even during periods of remission and impede treatment efficacy, prognosis and functional capacity. This highlights a pressing clinical need to identify novel effective anxiety treatments. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence within the field.

Methods

Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) targeting anxiety in remitted BD patients.

Results

We identified 10 RCTs investigating the effects of psychological or pharmacological treatments on anxiety in remitted BD patients. Two studies of transdiagnostic personalised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) found a treatment-related reduction in anxiety. This evidence was preliminary given small sample size and use of self-report measures in a single-blind trial design, respectively. The remaining six psychological intervention trials provided more preliminary evidence due to several methodological challenges. The two pharmacological studies found anxiolytic effects of add-on olanzapine or methylene blue to lithium treatment, respectively. Nevertheless, this evidence should be interpreted with caution given high drop-out rates and substantial side-effects that may have impeded blinding.

Limitations

We did not conduct a quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of modified CBT and add-on pharmacotherapy on residual anxiety in BD. Future trials should pre-screen participants for anxiety, define one clinician-rated anxiety measurement as a primary outcome, and employ intention-to-treat analysis to assess treatment effect. This will advance treatment development and enable personalised approaches to address residual anxiety in BD, which has great clinical relevance.

9 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The diagnosis and management of BD is complex, and effective, evidence‐based care requires knowledge of current research as well as lessons gained from years of clinical experience. Members of the CANMAT guidelines committee hope this document does an effective job at providing an easy to understand narrative of both, thus aiding both specialists and primary care providers in delivering evidence‐based care to their patients. As with previous editions of these guidelines, CANMAT will strive to provide regular updates capturing emerging trends and evaluating new evidence; and readers are encouraged to consult those as they become available to stay up to date in the field.

### The importance of anxiety States in bipolar disorder [^1161j4z8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Anxiety symptoms and syndromes are common in bipolar disorders, occurring in over half of all subjects with bipolar disorder type I. Despite methodological and diagnostic inconsistencies, most studies have shown a robust association between the presence of a broadly defined comorbid anxiety disorder and important indices of clinical morbidity in bipolar disorder, including a greater number of depressive episodes, worse treatment outcomes, and elevated risk of attempting suicide. Anxiety symptoms and/or syndromes often precede the onset of bipolar disorder and may represent a clinical phenotype of increased risk in subjects with prodromal symptoms. Although the causal relationship between anxiety and bipolar disorders remains unresolved, the multifactorial nature of most psychiatric phenotypes suggests that even with progress towards more biologically valid phenotypes, the "phenomenon" of comorbidity is likely to remain a clinical reality. Treatment studies of bipolar patients with comorbid anxiety have begun to provide preliminary evidence for the role of specific pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, but these need to be confirmed in more definitive trials. Hence, there is an immediate need for further research to help guide assessment and help identify appropriate treatments for comorbid conditions.

### Psychotherapies for comorbid anxiety in bipolar spectrum disorders [^113jB8qh]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Comorbid anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in bipolar disorder and have been shown to have serious negative impacts on the course of illness. The pharmacological treatment of anxiety can interact with the bipolar disorder and has not been proven effective. As such, many have recommended the psychological treatment of anxiety. This paper reviews the literature on psychological treatments for anxiety comorbid to bipolar disorder.

Method

The Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases were thoroughly examined for relevant treatment studies.

Results

Despite frequent recommendations in the literature, surprisingly few have studied the psychological treatment of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorders. Nevertheless, preliminary results suggest that comorbid anxiety disorders can be effectively treated in a bipolar clientele using cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral therapy or relaxation training. In contrast, interpersonal, family therapy and psychoeducation alone would not seem to be beneficial treatment alternatives for anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy appears to reduce the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and general symptoms of anxiety among patients with bipolar disorder. However, the long-term maintenance of anxiety treatment effects may be somewhat reduced and adaptations may be called for to augment and sustain benefits.

Conclusions

There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials of different forms of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders comorbid to bipolar disorder. Until such trials are available, the most promising approach would appear to be the sequential or modular CBT-based treatment of the anxiety disorder.

Hierarchical rankings of treatment recommendations: How were they arrived at? [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Of note, when a treatment is listed as a monotherapy, that implies that it may be used on its own or in combination with other ongoing treatments, even if there are no specific studies demonstrating the efficacy of that combination. In this situation, the assumption is that the previous ongoing treatment was partially effective, and the addition of the new agent will provide benefits in either an additive or synergistic manner. In contrast, agents specifically listed as adjunctive therapy may have no evidence for efficacy as monotherapy, and/or may have safety concerns if prescribed as monotherapy (eg. antidepressants), and are only recommended for use in combination with other evidence‐based agents.

As with previous editions, these guidelines also have a "not recommended" category which includes treatments that have clearly been shown to be ineffective in double‐blind RCTs. Further, we have included another category called "no specific recommendation/agents that require further study" to list treatments with insufficient evidence or clinical experience to make a recommendation, or where there is a reason to believe that negative trials failed because of methodological problems‐especially when the results are inconsistent with what is expected based on the pharmacological properties of treatment and clinical experience. Inclusion in this category means the efficacy of these agents is unknown at this time.

### Efficacy and acceptability of pharmacotherapy for comorbid anxiety symptoms in bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rnnUR]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) but there is little guidance on pharmacotherapy for these symptoms. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the available evidence for pharmacotherapy of comorbid anxiety symptoms in BD.

Methods

Completed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications for BD published prior to December 2020 were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ISRCTN. Data from RCTs measuring anxiety symptoms at baseline and endpoint and all-cause discontinuation were pooled to compare the efficacy and acceptability of medications with control conditions.

Results

Thirty-seven RCTs met our inclusion criteria; 13 placebo-controlled RCTs with 2175 participants had sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis assessing anxiety symptoms. Compared with placebo, the overall effect size of medications (primarily atypical antipsychotics) on anxiety symptoms was small with a standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.22 (95% CI: -0.34 to -0.11). Study heterogeneity was low (I 2 = 26%). The acceptability of these medications was comparable with placebo with odds ratio of discontinuation from all causes = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91–1.06).

Conclusion

There is limited evidence for a small anxiolytic effect and good acceptability of pharmacotherapy (primarily atypical antipsychotics) in the treatment of comorbid anxiety symptoms in BD. These results highlight the need for further research on medications other than atypical antipsychotics.

### Do comorbid anxiety disorders moderate the effects of psychotherapy for bipolar disorder? Results from STEP-BD [^114iw7Hh]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

At least 50% of individuals with bipolar disorder have a lifetime anxiety disorder. Individuals with both bipolar disorder and a co-occurring anxiety disorder experience longer illness duration, greater illness severity, and poorer treatment response. The study explored whether comorbid lifetime anxiety in bipolar patients moderates psychotherapy treatment outcome.

Method

In the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program randomized controlled trial of psychotherapy for bipolar depression, participants received up to 30 sessions of intensive psychotherapy (family-focused therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, or cognitive-behavioral therapy) or collaborative care, a three-session comparison treatment, plus pharmacotherapy. Using the number needed to treat, we computed effect sizes to analyze the relationship between lifetime anxiety disorders and rates of recovery across treatment groups after 1 year.

Results

A total of 269 patients (113 women) with a comorbid lifetime anxiety disorder (N = 177) or without a comorbid lifetime anxiety disorder (N = 92) were included in the analysis. Participants with a lifetime anxiety disorder were more likely to recover with psychotherapy than with collaborative care (66% compared with 49% recovered over 1 year; number needed to treat = 5.88, small to medium effect). For patients without a lifetime anxiety disorder, there was no difference between rates of recovery in psychotherapy compared with collaborative care (64% compared with 62% recovered; number needed to treat = 50, small effect). Participants with one lifetime anxiety disorder were likely to benefit from intensive psychotherapy compared with collaborative care (84% compared with 53% recovered; number needed to treat = 3.22, medium to large effect), whereas patients with multiple anxiety disorders exhibited no difference in response to the two treatments (54% compared with 46% recovered; number needed to treat = 12.5, small effect).

Conclusions

Depressed patients with bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety may be in particular need of additional psychotherapy for treating acute depression. These results need to be replicated in studies that stratify bipolar patients to treatments based on their anxiety comorbidity status.

As in previous editions, these guidelines are organized into eight sections (Table 3), including the Introduction. Foundations of management (Section 2) discusses the epidemiology of BD, screening and diagnostic considerations, the importance of monitoring risk for suicide, the chronic disease management model and patient‐centred care (including shared decision making), as well the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment. Additional information on presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4) are reviewed, and include descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. The importance of long‐term maintenance treatment and promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hierarchical rankings of treatment options are discussed in Section 5. An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are presented in Section 6. The management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidity are each discussed in Section 7. Finally, the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments are provided in Section 8.

Table 3
Sections

For convenience and to avoid confusion, these guidelines also include a table of commonly used terms (with an explanation of the intended meaning) that may have overlapping definitions or criteria in the literature (Table 4).

Table 4
Clarifying overlapping terminology

These guidelines are intended for use by psychiatrists and primary care providers who care for patients with BD throughout the lifespan, supporting them to provide evidence‐based assessment, treatment of acute symptoms, prevention of episode recurrence, and management of comorbidities. These guidelines are not meant to replace clinical judgement or define standards of care. While designed with Canadian physicians in mind, input from experts from the ISBD makes these guidelines applicable for practitioners from across the globe. As with previous publications, CANMAT will strive to publish regular updates to these guidelines, incorporating new knowledge useful for practising clinicians.

As not all medications included in these guidelines will be available in all countries, including Canada, clinicians are advised to follow the recommendations of local regulatory bodies.

5.4 Efficacy ratings for pharmacological agents used as maintenance therapy: importance of naturalistic and cohort studies

Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow‐up time‐frames while, for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole‐population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. 358, 359, 360 These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide. 361, 362

Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. 363, 364, 365 This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non‐random treatment allocation.

5.5 Pharmacological treatments for maintenance therapy

As in earlier sections, pharmacological treatments for maintenance therapy have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy (Table 1) as well as safety and tolerability (Section 8). Results are summarized in Table 17.

Table 2
Definitions for line of treatment ratings

In the current edition, an additional distinction is made between safety and tolerability, and a consensus rating is assigned to each medication on these two measures when used in both the acute and maintenance phase. Further, a rating is also assigned to each medication for its propensity to switch patients into mania or depression (treatment‐emergent switch). More information on these ratings can be found in the respective treatment sections, as well as in Section 8.

The final grading of recommendations into first, second, or third‐ line considers levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and risk of treatment‐emergent switch. In addition, hierarchical rankings were created and are listed in the tables for first and second line recommendations for acute mania, depression and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder (BDI). This hierarchy was created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness (Figure 1). The rationale for the hierarchical approach is that BD is a chronic lifetime condition with recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood symptoms, and most if not all patients will require maintenance treatment. Since treatments that are prescribed for an acute mood episode are usually continued into maintenance treatment, maintenance efficacy should be considered when choosing acute‐phase treatments. Treatments that have demonstrated efficacy across the spectrum of the illness should thus be tried first before treatments that have demonstrated efficacy for only selective phases of the disorder. As an example, if two treatments are shown to be similarly effective in acute mania, and if only one of these treatments has demonstrated efficacy for maintenance treatment, the treatment with evidence for maintenance would be placed higher in the hierarchical ranking.

7.4.1.1 Epidemiology

Most patients diagnosed with BD will also have at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. The most common comorbid conditions are substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, and impulse control disorder (such as ADHD, ODD, and CD). 45 Comorbidity impacts the course of BDs by increasing the likelihood of treatment resistance and suicide risk, and also by increasing the time spent with impairing symptoms. 34, 50, 669, 670

When treating comorbid conditions, determining which disorder to address first requires careful consideration. Some comorbid disorders may be managed with the same treatment employed to manage bipolar symptoms (eg, quetiapine for comorbid anxiety and BD), while other comorbid disorders (eg, ADHD) may require distinct treatments. Importantly, some treatments for comorbid disorders may lead to bipolar symptom destabilization; for instance, an antidepressant employed to treat an anxiety disorder may provoke mood elevation.

Safely and effectively managing comorbid conditions often necessitates the implementation of a hierarchical approach, depending on each patient's individual needs and preferences. In general, the disorder or symptom associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality — such as acute mania, psychosis, or suicidal ideation — should be managed first. Substance use disorders may be addressed concurrently or sequentially, depending on severity and contribution to mood instability. Once mood stability is established, the treatment of additional comorbid conditions, such as ADHD or metabolic disorders, should follow based on their impact and the patient's preference.

There is a dearth of research to guide the best management of BD in the context of comorbid conditions. There have been few trials designed with comorbid symptoms as the primary target for mood‐stabilizing treatments — evidence is mainly derived from secondary analysis of published data. Thus, the limited research informing the treatment of comorbidities constrains our ability to make definitive recommendations. However, because comorbidity is so common and burdensome for patients, appropriate management is a challenging daily reality in clinical practice. Therefore, CANMAT decided to provide a brief overview of relevant clinical issues and the evidence base for pharmacological treatments for treating comorbid populations. The reader is advised to consult the following references for the role of psychological treatments in managing comorbidity. 671, 672, 673

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2007 [^115KRsEh]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

In 2005, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder. This update reviews new evidence since the previous publication and incorporates recommendations based on the most current evidence for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the 2005 CANMAT Guidelines. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. For the management of bipolar depression, new data support quetiapine monotherapy as a first-line option. Lithium and lamotrigine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion continue to remain the other first-line options. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder continue to be lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. There is recent evidence to support the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine as a second-line maintenance therapy for bipolar depression. New data also support quetiapine monotherapy as a second-line option for the management of acute bipolar II depression. The importance of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions cannot be understated, and this update provides an expanded look at the prevalence, impact and management of comorbid conditions in patients with bipolar disorder.

### Co-occurrence of anxiety and bipolar disorders: clinical and therapeutic overview [^111Y3M3D]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety commonly co-occurs with bipolar disorders (BDs), but the significance of such "co-morbidity" remains to be clarified and its optimal treatment adequately defined.

Methods

We reviewed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment studies of the co-occurrence of BD and anxiety disorder through electronic searching of Pubmed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.

Results

Nearly half of BD patients meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at some time, and anxiety is associated with poor treatment responses, substance abuse, and disability. Reported rates of specific anxiety disorders with BD rank: panic ≥ phobias ≥ generalized anxiety ≥ posttraumatic stress ≥ obsessive-compulsive disorders. Their prevalence appears to be greater among women than men, but similar in types I and II BD. Anxiety may be more likely in depressive phases of BD, but relationships of anxiety phenomena to particular phases of BD, and their temporal distributions require clarification. Adequate treatment trials for anxiety syndromes in BD patients remain rare, and the impact on anxiety of treatments aimed at mood stabilization is not clear. Benzodiazepines are sometimes given empirically; antidepressants are employed cautiously to limit risks of mood switching and emotional destabilization; lamotrigine, valproate, and second-generation antipsychotics may be useful and relatively safe.

Conclusions

Anxiety symptoms and syndromes co-occur commonly in patients with BD, but "co-morbid" phenomena may be part of the BD phenotype rather than separate illnesses.

### Treating nonspecific anxiety and anxiety disorders in patients with bipolar disorder: a review [^117VsvZq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for treating anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder.

Data Sources

A literature search from 1950 to week 1 of August 2009 was conducted via OVID and the National Institutes of Health's clinical trials online databases. Search terms included anxiety, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and treatment. Reference lists of identified articles were also searched.

Study Selection

Fourteen treatment studies that included patients with bipolar disorder with either a syndrome-defined anxiety disorder or nonspecific anxiety were selected.

Data Extraction

Sample size, bipolar disorder subtype, comorbid anxiety disorders, baseline anxiety, treatment interventions, and outcome measurements were extracted.

Results

The majority of studies focus on treating anxiety disorders and nonspecific anxiety occurring during bipolar mood episodes. Studies of syndrome-defined anxiety disorders reveal that risperidone monotherapy did not separate from placebo and that olanzapine was superior to lamotrigine when used to augment lithium treatment. A study using open-label divalproex sodium and an uncontrolled study of group cognitive-behavioral therapy both suggest some benefit from these treatments in patients with bipolar disorder with panic disorder. Studies of nonspecific anxiety reveal some benefit for divalproex, quetiapine, olanzapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Weaker evidence supports the use of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and observational studies suggest potential efficacy for gabapentin and valproate.

Conclusions

Nonspecific anxiety symptoms occurring during a mood episode improve with treatment of the mood disturbance, though divalproex may be the mood stabilizer of choice for anxious patients with bipolar disorder. Given their reduced risk for manic induction and episode cycling, psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, and certain atypical antipsychotics are recommended for treatment of anxiety disorders present in patients with bipolar disorder not currently experiencing an acute mood episode.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — residual anxiety in remitted patients: For individuals with fully or partially remitted bipolar disorder and with residual anxiety symptoms, we suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence suggests that CBT is effective for individuals with fully or partially remitted BD 1 or BD 2 with residual anxiety symptoms, with a systematic review suggesting a reduction in residual anxiety in the psychotherapy group compared with those in the control group after treatment completion. For non-mindfulness CBT specifically, two of five RCTs suggested a reduction in anxiety symptoms in the psychotherapy group compared with the control group, and for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) specifically, two of three RCTs showed a reduction when compared with control, while the third RCT found within-group reduction but no between-group difference. Although earlier narratives discussed quetiapine's benefits possibly including reductions in comorbid anxiety, the Work Group determined that the strength of the evidence was not sufficient to include a suggestion for pharmacotherapy with quetiapine for comorbid anxiety. The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and it concluded that the benefits of CBT for individuals with fully or partially remitted BD 1 or BD 2 outweighed the potential harm.

2.6.6 Other psychosocial interventions

Various other approaches have been tried in BD, with a variety of aims, modalities, and outcome targets. None of the other interventions have been specifically targeted for bipolar depression or for mania. Some have been designed in part to reduce episode recurrence, but none have been successful in providing substantial evidence of efficacy. Because CANMAT recommendations are for the treatment of acute depression and mania, and maintenance treatment to prevent them, we do not make specific recommendations regarding these treatments. However, some of these approaches have been helpful in ameliorating some important symptoms in individuals with BD, (such as residual mood symptoms or anxiety) and so we will describe them briefly.

Although somewhat like FFT, family/caregiver interventions constitute a distinctly different psychosocial intervention in that the intervention is given to the family/caregiver, not the person with BD, and evidence exists that such interventions improve clinical outcomes in the patient. 75, 113 Clinical wisdom and common practice, however, support the importance of family or caregivers being included in at least some sessions with the patient (particularly for psychoeducation), both to reduce symptom burden on the individual with BD and to reduce burnout and emotional burden on the caregiver. Validated caregiver resources are available online, such as. 114

DBT, which includes distress tolerance training, has several small studies showing its utility in the reduction of some depressive symptoms and suicidality. 75

One RCT of MBCT involving 95 patients did not demonstrate any difference in relapse prevention compared to a treatment‐as‐usual group, but did reveal fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms in the MBCT arm. 115 Coupled with the findings of other smaller studies, this suggests that MBCT may have a role to play in anxiety reduction in BD. 75, 116

While not reviewed here, given that individuals with BD may have histories of childhood abuse and comorbid personality disorders, and experience various sequelae such as shame or conflict due to behaviours experienced during acute bipolar episodes, all of these may rightly be a target for psychosocial intervention in a very individualized manner.

5.5.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications that have been found to be effective in the acute phase should be continued during the maintenance phase. However, there are exceptions to this: the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been examined systematically in large double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials; hence, long‐term antidepressant use is not recommended, especially in light of the concerns about potential risk of manic/hypomanic switch and mood instability. However, in the subgroups of patients who have responded to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawal of antidepressants may contribute to destabilization. 366

Clinical trials have shown that many atypical antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapse of mood episodes; with many agents, this efficacy is related to prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode and, given that the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, depressive relapse rates in placebo groups in such studies have been low‐ compromising the statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in prevention of depressive relapses. Thus, the efficacy of many of these agents in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.

For patients who are currently not receiving or responding to pharmacological treatment, a careful history including details of clinical course, response (or lack thereof) to previously used medications, and family history should be collected. Other variables to be considered include psychiatric comorbidity (including substance use), the predominant illness polarity, and the polarity of the most recent episode.

Ongoing clinical monitoring, including medication blood levels as appropriate, is also a crucial part of maintenance treatment that should be used to support enhanced medication adherence, detection of early symptoms of recurrence, and monitoring of side effects (see Section 8).

2.4 Chronic disease management

Due to the chronic, relapsing and remitting nature of BD, a long‐term, multidisciplinary approach to management is needed. The Chronic Disease Management Model 56 outlines several important principles to enhance long‐term care for these individuals and their families (Table 9). After basic clinical management, including attention to diagnosis, comorbidity, and medical health has been established, patient health education and pharmacotherapy should be the initial and foundational steps for all patients. Ideally, the patient will be connected to a health care team which includes at least one other health care professional (typically a nurse) in addition to the psychiatrist for psychoeducation, ongoing monitoring, psychosocial support, and referral to community resources. 57 All patients should have access to a primary care provider to attend to mental and physical health needs. If the patient is stable and discharged to primary care, the mental health care system should provide support directly to the primary care provider with attention to continuity of care. 58 Additional psychosocial treatments (described below) may also be selected to fit the specific needs and preferences of the patient.

Table 9
The chronic disease management model

A strong therapeutic alliance is central to improve treatment adherence and outcomes. 59, 60 Providers should encourage individuals to actively participate in treatment planning, using a shared decision‐making approach. 61, 62 Whenever possible, family members or key friends should be included as part of the care team. There is evidence that specialized, team‐approach‐based interventions combining pharmacotherapy and psychoeducation are more effective than standard community care. 63

Regular, ongoing monitoring of mood symptoms and other measures related to the patient's own individual recovery, such as sleep, cognition, functioning, and quality of life is encouraged. 18 For many patients, daily recording of mood symptoms such as through a mood diary or National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Life Chart Method‐Self Rating Scale can help identify early warning signs of relapse, as well as outline relationships between mood and treatment or lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, or stress. 64 While many patients will agree with the value of completing a mood diary, and this strategy has been shown to improve treatment, regular completion can be a burden. 65 Online solutions such as mobile apps may improve adherence, 66 such as the Self‐Monitoring and Psychoeducation In Bipolar Patients smartphone app (SIMPLE) which provides weekly and daily mood tests, with reminders to take medication or see their doctor. 67, 68, 69

3.3 Pharmacological treatment of manic episodes

There are a range of strategies that have been investigated for use in mania; including lithium, divalproex, other anticonvulsants, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and other agents and therapies. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy (Table 1) as well as safety and tolerability (Section 8). The evidence for efficacy and the recommendations for treating acute mania are summarized in Table 12.

Table 12
Hierarchical rankings of first and second‐line treatments recommended for management of acute mania

As stated previously, the first and second‐line agents are listed hierarchically taking into consideration not only their efficacy for acute mania but also their efficacy in preventing mania or depression, treating acute bipolar depression, safety/tolerability and the risk of treatment‐emergent switch. The implication of this hierarchical recommendation is that those listed higher up in the table should be considered first before moving on to the next on the list, unless other factors such as history of previous non‐response or patient's preferences preclude such strategy in a given patient.

Monotherapy and combination therapy are listed separately as first‐line treatments for acute mania in Table 12. This does not mean that all monotherapy agents should be tried first before considering combination therapy for acute mania. We suggest that the treating clinician make a decision as to whether to treat a given patient with monotherapy or combination therapy. That decision is typically based on the rapidity of response needed (eg, combination treatments tend to work faster), whether the patient had a previous history of partial response to monotherapy, severity of mania, tolerability concerns with combination therapy, and willingness of the patient to take combination therapy. Once a decision is made whether to treat the patient with monotherapy or combination therapy, then hierarchy related to monotherapy or combination therapy could be followed. We also suggest that clinicians evaluate the efficacy and tolerability at the end of weeks 1 and 2 and modify treatment options accordingly.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) recommendations for the management of patients with bipolar disorder with mixed presentations [^116pnV22]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2018 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guidelines provided clinicians with pragmatic treatment recommendations for bipolar disorder (BD). While these guidelines included commentary on how mixed features may direct treatment selection, specific recommendations were not provided-a critical gap which the current update aims to address.

Method

Overview of research regarding mixed presentations in BD, with treatment recommendations developed using a modified CANMAT/ISBD rating methodology. Limitations are discussed, including the dearth of high-quality data and reliance on expert opinion.

Results

No agents met threshold for first-line treatment of DSM-5 manic or depressive episodes with mixed features. For mania + mixed features second-line treatment options include asenapine, cariprazine, divalproex, and aripiprazole. In depression + mixed features, cariprazine and lurasidone are recommended as second-line options. For DSM-IV defined mixed episodes, with a longer history of research, asenapine and aripiprazole are first-line, and olanzapine (monotherapy or combination), carbamazepine, and divalproex are second-line. Research on maintenance treatments following a DSM-5 mixed presentation is extremely limited, with third-line recommendations based on expert opinion. For maintenance treatment following a DSM-IV mixed episode, quetiapine (monotherapy or combination) is first-line, and lithium and olanzapine identified as second-line options.

Conclusion

The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope these guidelines provide valuable support for clinicians providing care to patients experiencing mixed presentations, as well as further influence investment in research to improve diagnosis and treatment of this common and complex clinical state.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for acute treatment of bipolar anxiety [^114Jixu1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of bipolar disorder is often complicated by the presence of a co-occuring anxiety disorder. Although second generation antipsychotics are being used with increasing frequency in bipolar patients, their anxiolytic effects have not been well studied in this population.

Methods

The anxiolytic effect of risperidone 0.5–4 mg/day was tested in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 111 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occuring panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The primary outcome measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety scale (CGI-21 Anxiety). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale.

Results

On the last-observation-carried forward analysis of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), risperidone was not more effective than placebo for the CGI-21 Anxiety score or the other anxiety outcome measures. Risperidone was well tolerated, with only two patients withdrawing because of adverse events.

Limitations

The risperidone treated group had more patients with mixed states and lifetime panic disorder at randomization than the placebo group. The study was limited to 8 weeks and to individuals with bipolar and comorbid panic disorder or GAD. The results may not be applicable to risperidone as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers, or to bipolar disorder comorbid with anxiety disorders other than panic disorder or GAD.

Conclusions

Risperidone monotherapy was not an effective anxiolytic for bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder or GAD in doses of 0.5–4 mg/day over 8 weeks of treatment. The efficacy of other second generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers on anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occuring anxiety disorder should be investigated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

### Prevalence and impact of comorbid anxiety and bipolar disorder [^115kfw5L]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Comorbid conditions pose a serious risk to patients with bipolar disorder, but anxiety comorbidity poses a specific hazard due to the increased negative impact of anxiety on illness course and treatment. Anxiety comorbidity appears to be highly prevalent and is associated with intensified symptoms of bipolar disorder and additional comorbid disorders, resulting in a negative impact on the patient and on the course of the illness. The presence of anxiety in bipolar patients is also associated with a lowered age at onset, hampered patient response to treatment such as lithium, increased rates of suicide and substance abuse, and decreased quality of life. Patients can experience work, family, and social impairment and be made to contend with increased health care costs and strains on family support. Studies are few and have a limited scope, and many have failed to consider the clinical significance of comorbid anxiety and bipolar disorder. Because the degree to which anxiety impacts patients with bipolar disorder is not fully known, more information is needed about the relationship between bipolar disorder and anxiety.

### Anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder: a review [^1153gFRn]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Epidemiological, clinical and familial studies indicate that anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly comorbid in persons with bipolar disorder (BPD). The phenomenological overlap between ADs and BPD is reported more frequently in individuals with female predominant bipolar presentations (e.g., bipolar II disorder). Anxiety comorbidity in the BPD population poses a serious hazard. For example, it is associated with an intensification of symptoms, non-recovery, substance use comorbidity and harmful dysfunction (e.g., suicidality).

Objective

The evidentiary base informing treatment decisions for the anxious bipolar patient is woefully inadequate. Several expert consensus and evidence-based treatment guidelines for BPD suggest various treatment avenues, although these have been insufficiently studied. The encompassing aim of this paper is to synthesize extant studies reporting on the co-occurrence of AD and BPD. Taken together, a compelling basis emerges for prioritizing the identification and management of anxiety symptomatology in the BPD population.

5 MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER

5.1 Need for long‐term strategies

Almost all individuals with BD require maintenance treatment to prevent subsequent episodes, reduce residual symptoms, and restore functioning and quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest that, for a subgroup of patients, BD may be a neuroprogressive disease in which recurrences are associated with reductions in brain grey and white matter volumes, worsening cognitive impairment, a decrease in inter‐episodic recovery and functioning, a higher rate and severity of relapse, and a reduced rate of treatment response to both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. 325 It is therefore important that comprehensive treatment be initiated even after a first episode. 63 Effective maintenance treatment, early in the course of illness, has been shown to reverse cognitive impairment and preserve brain plasticity, particularly in those who remain episode free, 326, 327 and may therefore lead to improved prognosis and minimization of illness progression. 328 There are preliminary data suggesting that, after a first episode, lithium might be superior to quetiapine in both volumetric and cognitive outcomes. 329, 330

With treatment, 19%‐25% of patients will experience a recurrence every year, compared to 23%‐40% of those on placebo. 331 Risk factors for recurrence include younger age of onset, 332 psychotic features, 212 rapid cycling, 331 more (and more frequent) previous episodes, 333 comorbid anxiety, 334 and comorbid SUDs. 335 Persistent subthreshold symptoms also increase risk for subsequent mood episodes, 334, 336, 337 and the presence of residual symptoms should therefore be an indicator of a need for further treatment optimization. Availability of psychosocial support and lower levels of stress are also protective against recurrence. 337, 338

### The role of atypical antipsychotics in bipolar depression and anxiety disorders [^117A9zxC]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex condition that includes symptoms of mania, depression, and often anxiety. Diagnosing and treating bipolar depression is challenging, with the disorder often being diagnosed as unipolar depression. In addition, comorbid anxiety can be a significant detractor to successful outcomes, increasing symptom severity, frequency of episodes and suicide rates, and decreasing response to antidepressant therapy. Anxiety often precedes and hastens the onset of bipolar disorder, and a shared genetic etiology has been suggested. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for the acute and maintenance treatment of mania. Evidence from studies in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and bipolar depression indicate that these agents may also have antidepressant effects. In open trials in patients with bipolar mania, risperidone therapy has led to significant reductions in depression scores compared with baseline. Reductions in depression scores in patients with bipolar mania have been significantly greater with olanzapine compared with placebo. In patients with bipolar depression, the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine resulted in significant improvement in depression compared with olanzapine alone or placebo. Although little data are available on the effects of these agents on comorbid anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder, some atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy in patients with anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Thus, atypical antipsychotics represent an important therapeutic option for the treatment of bipolar disorder, providing improvements in manic, depressive, and anxiety symptoms.

8.3.12 Fracture risk and osteoporosis

Some anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics may decrease bone mineral density and increase the risk of fracture in high‐risk patients. 874, 875 This risk is increased by the presence of mood disorders, as well as known risks for mood disorders such as physical inactivity, smoking and poor diet quality. 876 Thus, screening for this population may be indicated. 877

Anxious distress

Symptoms of anxiety are often experienced during a depressive episode, and are predictive of more persistent depressive symptoms 311 and increased suicidal ideation. 312 A pooled analysis of two double‐blind RCTs demonstrated that quetiapine is more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms of anxiety co‐occurring alongside bipolar depression, 313 and olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination has also been shown to be effective. 314 In a post hoc analysis, lurasidone was effective in improving depressive as well as anxiety symptoms in patients with MDD who had mixed features and anxiety. 315 The anxiolytic effects of divalproex, risperidone, and lamotrigine appear to be limited. 199, 316

Mixed features

Many patients with bipolar depression will also experience at least subsyndromal hypomanic or manic features, and this presentation is associated with more severe depressive symptoms, as well as a higher rate of substance use and cardiovascular disease. 317 For many of these patients, combination therapy will be necessary to adequately address symptoms. 318 Pooled analysis indicates that atypical antipsychotics show a class effect in alleviating mixed features in bipolar depression, with olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination, asenapine, and lurasidone all demonstrating efficacy. 319 Lurasidone has further been shown to have efficacy in treating both depressive and hypomanic symptoms in MDD with mixed features. 320 The ISBD Task Force recommends avoiding antidepressants in patients with mixed features 260 and the CANMAT/ISBD group concurs with this recommendation.

Melancholic features

No specific studies assessed the predictive ability of melancholic features; however, clinical experience suggests that ECT is very effective in this population.

Atypical features

There is some evidence for efficacy of tranylcypromine in patients with anergic bipolar depression. 321 However, given the risks of potential manic switch, this agent should only be used in conjunction with lithium or divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic. Clinicians also must consider adverse events of this agent related to its interactions with food and other medications.

Psychotic features (mood congruent or incongruent)

Up to 20% of inpatients experience psychosis in the context of an acute bipolar depressive episode. 322 The relative efficacy of various medications to treat these features in this phase of illness has not been examined, although clinical experience suggests that ECT and antipsychotics are highly effective for this population.

4.4 Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression

Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have all been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy (Table 1) as well as safety and tolerability (Section 8). Recommendations are summarized in Table 14.

Table 14
Hierarchical rankings of first and second‐line treatments recommended for management of acute bipolar I depression

4.4.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide/self‐harm behaviour, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient), with consideration given to management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol/drug use, medications, other treatments, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. Course of illness and treatments used in current and prior episodes should be assessed, including past response to and tolerability of specific medications and doses, and used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Consideration should be given to restarting medications if their recent discontinuation appeared to coincide with a depressive relapse.

Psychoeducation and other psychosocial strategies should also be offered alongside pharmacological treatment to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms and suicidal behaviour, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

4.4.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended for all patients that pharmacotherapy be initiated with one or more of the available first‐line agents. The choice of agent or agents to manage an acute bipolar depressive episode should be discussed with the patient and their supporters (as appropriate) and take into account current and prior medication use and response, personal preference, and the safety and tolerability of each agent, as well as clinical features that may influence prognosis (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices").

### Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders is here to stay [^114U4dgR]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are common and disabling. Cognitive behavior therapy is the treatment of choice but is often difficult to obtain. Automated, internet-delivered, cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) courses may be an answer. There are three recent systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that show that the benefits are substantial (d = 1.0) and similar to face to face CBT. There are two large effectiveness trials that demonstrate strong effects when iCBT is used in primary care; 60% of patients who complete the courses no longer meet diagnostic criteria. The courses are suitable for most people with a primary anxiety disorder. Research studies usually exclude people whose anxiety is secondary to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or substance abuse or who are actively suicidal. Little additional input from clinicians is required. Patients find the courses very convenient. Clinically, the principal advantage is the fidelity of the treatment. What you prescribe is what the patient sees.

### Pharmacologic treatment considerations in co-occurring bipolar and anxiety disorders [^117UUdAi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are among the most commonly co-occurring psychiatric syndromes with bipolar disorder. The presence of co-occurring anxiety disorders has important prognostic and treatment implications.

Method

Using the PaperChase database augmented by a manual search of the literature, we identified 122 publications that consisted of reports regarding pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of bipolar disorder also assessing the efficacy of these agents in anxiety disorders, treatment studies of patients with comorbid bipolar disorder and specific anxiety disorders, and studies of novel antiepileptic agents in the treatment of anxiety symptoms or disorders.

Results

No randomized controlled trials have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder and any co-occurring anxiety disorder. Among agents with antimanic or mood-stabilizing effects, evidence of efficacy from placebo-controlled trials exists for valproate in the treatment of panic disorder; lamotrigine, risperidone, and olanzapine in posttraumatic stress disorder; and risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine as adjunctive treatment in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Antidepressants from virtually every class have efficacy in the treatment of most anxiety disorders but present the challenge of minimizing switch risk when used in conjunction with a moodstabilizer. Among novel antiepileptic agents without proven thymoleptic properties studied in randomized controlled trials in anxiety disorders, gabapentin and pregabalin had efficacy in the treatment of social anxiety disorder, and pregabalin in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

Conclusion

In the absence of controlled trials in patients with comorbid bipolar and anxiety disorders, the initial goals of treatment include mood stabilization and selection of thymoleptic agents with efficacy in the co-occurring anxiety disorder.

Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder

Quetiapine was superior to placebo and divalproex in improving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid GAD and/or panic disorder (level 2). 724 Further, secondary analyses from several RCTs indicate that quetiapine monotherapy significantly reduces symptoms of GAD and panic disorder in patients with bipolar depression. 290, 313, 725 Negative trials include risperidone versus placebo in patients with BD and comorbid GAD and/or panic disorder 726 and ziprasidone versus placebo in a similar trial. 727

For patients who are euthymic and treated with lithium, the addition of lamotrigine or olanzapine has demonstrated similar anxiolytic effects (level 3). 728 In a secondary post hoc analysis, combinations of olanzapine and fluoxetine (level 3), and to a lesser extent olanzapine monotherapy, were effective in reducing anxiety in patients with bipolar depression. 314

Gabapentin employed as an adjunctive therapy in open‐label studies reduced anxiety symptoms in patients with BD (level 4). 696, 729 Given its relatively benign side effect profile and efficacy in other primary anxiety disorders, gabapentin is an appropriate strategy.

Obsessive compulsive disorder

Obsessive compulsive disorder was re‐categorized in DSM‐5 and is no longer characterized as an anxiety disorder; however, anxiety is a cardinal feature. OCD is a comorbid condition in 10%‐20% of patients with BD 730, 731, 732, 733 compared with 2%‐3% in the general population. 734 However, the prevalence appears to vary widely, depending on the clinical setting and bipolar subtype. 731 Comorbid OCD may be more common in children and adolescents with BD than in adults 731 and has been reported to co‐occur more commonly with BD than other anxiety disorders, 735 although other studies have not found that association. 736

When diagnosed comorbidly with BD, OCD has been associated with an earlier onset of BD, a higher number of previous mood episodes, rapid cycling, seasonality, substance misuse, and lower overall functioning. 732, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741, 742 Jeon et al recently conducted a comprehensive review of patients diagnosed with BD and comorbid OCD and found twice the rate of pharmacological switch to mania or hypomania, but suggested this could be due to the more frequent use of antidepressants in that population. 732 Other authors have raised similar concerns. 743

5.2 Treatment adherence

Concordance between clinician and patient views of illness and treatment is a crucial determinant of adherence, 339 and reinforces the need for a collaborative approach to the treatment alliance. 340 Asking about adherence behaviour and attitudes in a non‐judgemental manner and exploring the reasoning behind poor adherence are important parts of treatment, 341 as up to half of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. 342, 343, 344 Unrecognized treatment non‐adherence can lead physicians to believe that the patient is non‐responsive, resulting in unnecessary dose increases (especially problematic for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index), medication switches, or adjunctive medications. 341 Treatment withdrawal may precipitate recurrence; 50%‐90% of patients discontinuing lithium experience a recurrence within 3‐5 months, 345, 346 with rapid lithium discontinuation associated with greater recurrence risk than gradual discontinuation. 347 Withdrawal of other mood stabilizers also predicts recurrence. 348, 349 Risks for hospitalization, suicide, and lost productivity are also increased with non‐adherence or discontinuation. 350, 351, 352 A variety of patient, disorder, and treatment‐related risk factors for non‐adherence or partial adherence are outlined in Table 16. 353

Table 16
Risk factors for partial adherence or non‐adherence to medication

Meta‐analyses suggest that interventions aimed at engaging patients in treatment may more than double adherence compared to treatment as usual or other control groups. 354 Brief psychoeducational interventions focusing specifically on medication adherence can be integrated into clinical practice. 354 Flexible and collaborative engagement to address individual risk factors for non‐adherence is recommended to optimize acceptability of pharmacological therapies. 353, 355, 356, 357

5.3 Psychosocial interventions for maintenance therapy

Although pharmacotherapy is the foundation of maintenance treatment in BD, it is often insufficient to prevent recurrence. Over the last two decades, several controlled trials have examined the efficacy of adjunctive psychosocial treatments in reducing recurrence. On average, adjunctive psychosocial treatments reduce recurrence rates by about 15%. Therefore, adjunctive psychosocial interventions are an important component of management of BD and should be offered for all patients.

As described in more detail in Section 2, psychoeducation is the only first‐line psychosocial intervention for the maintenance phase (level 1), which should be offered to all patients. Additional second‐line options such as CBT (level 2) and FFT (level 2), and third‐line options such as IPSRT (level 2) and peer support (level 2) should be offered based on individual strengths and needs.

Substance use disorders

Two recent reviews indicated that the prevalence rate of comorbid SUD in BD is about 33% in general population surveys 674 and approximately 45% in clinical settings. 675 SUD can negatively impact the course of BD, resulting in lower rates of remission, 407 a higher number of hospitalizations, 676, 677 and an increased risk of suicide attempts 429 and perhaps suicide deaths. 678

Substance use should be addressed as early as possible, as it is likely to interfere with treatment for BD. However, the presence of a SUD should not preclude an attempt to treat BD, which might result in an individual being more amenable to treatment. As the directionality of the interaction between SUD and BD is rarely clear in the reality of clinical practice, it is recommended that the two conditions be treated simultaneously.

A more detailed discussion on the impact of and the general principles of the treatment of substance use comorbidity can be found in a CANMAT Task Force publication, 679 and other reviews 673, 681 and a meta‐analysis 680 published on the topic since 2012. Here we provide a brief update on the pharmacological treatments identified in the CANMAT Task Force publication. It is important to note that the criteria for level of evidence used here are more stringent than those applied to the Task Force report.

The levels of evidence for treatment of comorbid SUD are low. This is because of (i) the paucity of data, (ii) complexity of study designs (given the fact that many patients will be using more than one substance), and, most importantly (iii) inconsistency of the outcome variables used in these studies; hindering direct comparison of results. Nevertheless, some evidence‐based recommendations are available for clinicians, starting with general principles of treatment: if at all possible, avoid medications that could increase the risk of destabilizing the BD, and choose treatments that could help both conditions.

Second‐line

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first‐line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) 242, 258 is included as a second‐line option.

Adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] or bupropion) with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second‐line add‐on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta‐analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size. 259

This is a key aspect of decision‐making regarding antidepressants, since historically much of the focus has been on risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta‐analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add‐on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first‐line recommendation. As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, 260 antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant‐induced mania or hypomania, current or predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling. Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should NOT be used for the treatment of BDI depression.

ECT (level 3) is also a second‐line treatment, and should be considered particularly for treatment‐refractory patients and those for whom a rapid treatment response is needed, such as those with severe depression with imminent suicidal risk, catatonia or psychotic depression, and/or when a rapid response is important for medical stabilization. Data support efficacy for brief pulse right unilateral placement, although there are insufficient data to guide the decision of unilateral or bilateral placement for bipolar depression. 261 Additional second‐line options include cariprazine, with efficacy demonstrated through a large RCT 262 and a pooled analysis of a failed RCT and a positive RCT 263 (level 2), although there is less clinical experience supporting its use. Olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination (level 2) 264, 265 is effective and is also recommended as a second‐line option.

Similar to the approach for treatment of a manic episode, multiple first‐ and second‐line agents and combinations should be trialled before considering initiating third‐line agents in step 5.

First‐line

Quetiapine is the only recommended first‐line treatment for BDII depression (level 1). Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo, and moreover was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. 243, 437 The latter finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine beat placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. 253, 290, 438, 439, 440 This is probably because the smaller sample of BDII patients — only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials — provided less statistical power for BDII. Finally, open‐label studies also suggest efficacy for adjunctive quetiapine (level 4). 441, 442

Second‐line

Second‐line treatments include lithium, ideally at a serum level of 0.8‐1.2 mEq/L (level 2) (Figure 5), and the antidepressants sertraline (level 2) 426 and venlafaxine (level 2), 443, 444 mainly for patients with pure (non‐mixed) depression (Figure 6). Lamotrigine (level 2) is also recommended as a second‐line agent despite conflicting evidence, with the rationale for this provided in Figure 7. ECT (level 3) 261 can also be considered second‐line and is a good option, particularly for treatment refractory patients and those in need of rapid response.

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polarity as well as comorbid anxiety. 420, 421 Lamotrigine monotherapy is not appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited efficacy in preventing mania.

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with index manic, depressive and mixed episodes, and thus may be particularly valuable in those with mixed features. 422 Asenapine appears to be effective in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to carbamazepine were more likely to have an atypical illness, BDII or schizoaffective disorder. 405

Data to differentiate anti‐psychotic medication responders from non‐responders are lacking.

Overall, some of these possible predictors can have clinical utility, but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre‐treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or two episodes (practice recommended by most treatment guidelines), and biomarkers are intriguing but lack sufficient replication and are not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in previous sections, factors associated with rapid cycling must be addressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepressants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with a single mood stabilizer is often ineffective and patients may require a combination of mood stabilizers to achieve mood stability.

### The feasibility and acceptability of a novel anxiety in bipolar disorder intervention compared to treatment as usual: a randomized controlled trial [^117Fuyzr]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Comorbid anxiety is common in bipolar disorder (BD) and associated with worse clinical outcomes including increased suicidality. Despite effective psychological treatments for anxiety, research into treating anxiety in BD is underdeveloped. This paper describes a novel psychological intervention to address anxiety in context of bipolar disorder (AIBD).

Methods

Adults with BD and clinically significant anxiety symptoms were randomized to AIBD plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. AIBD offered 10 sessions of psychological therapy using a formulation-based approach. Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated through recruitment, retention, therapy attendance, alliance, fidelity, and qualitative feedback. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 48, and 80 weeks: interim assessments of relapse at 32 and 64 weeks.

Results

Seventy-two participants were recruited with 88% retention to 16 weeks and 74% to 80 weeks (similar between arms). Therapy participants attended < mml:math xmlns:mml = "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" > < mml:mrow > < mml:mover > < mml:mi > x < /mml:mi > < mml:mo > ¯ < /mml:mo > < /mml:mover > < mml:mspace > < /mml:mspace > < /mml:mrow > < /mml:math > 7.7 (SD 2.8) sessions. Therapeutic alliance and therapy fidelity were acceptable. Qualitative interviews indicated that participants valued integrated support for anxiety with BD and coping strategies. Some suggested a longer intervention period. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between arms up to 80 weeks follow-up.

Conclusions

AIBD is feasible and acceptable but lack of impact on clinical outcomes indicates that adaptations are required. These are discussed in relation to qualitative feedback and recent literature published since the trial completed.

### Anxiety disorder comorbidity in bipolar disorder patients: data from the first 500 participants in the systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (STEP-BD) [^115Qx19D]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors provide a detailed perspective on the correlates of comorbid anxiety in a large, well-characterized sample of bipolar disorder patients.

Method

Anxiety and its correlates were examined in a cross-sectional sample from the first 500 patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder, a multicenter project funded by the National Institute of Mental Health designed to evaluate the longitudinal outcome of patients with bipolar disorder.

Results

Lifetime comorbid anxiety disorders were common, occurring in over one-half of the sample, and were associated with younger age at onset, decreased likelihood of recovery, poorer role functioning and quality of life, less time euthymic, and greater likelihood of suicide attempts. Although substance abuse disorders were particularly prevalent among patients with anxiety disorders, comorbid anxiety appeared to exert an independent, deleterious effect on functioning, including history of suicide attempts (odds ratio = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.4–4.2).

Conclusions

An independent association of comorbid anxiety with greater severity and impairment in bipolar disorder patients was demonstrated, highlighting the need for greater clinical attention to anxiety in this population, particularly for enhanced clinical monitoring of suicidality. In addition, it is important to determine whether effective treatment of anxiety symptoms can lessen bipolar disorder severity, improve response to treatment of manic or depressive symptoms, or reduce suicidality.

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

2.6.2 Cognitive behavioural therapy

CBT in BD is supported by several published manuals and typically is given in 20 individual sessions over 6 months, often with additional booster sessions. Despite evidence of efficacy for CBT for MDD and psychosis, the results of CBT trials for BD have been mixed. One large RCT supports it use for acute bipolar depression 84 in a trial that compared the efficacy of up to 30 (mean 14) CBT sessions against those of FFT, IPSRT, and a three‐session control intervention, but it was not possible to identify whether the benefits came from changes in the medications prescribed or the psychosocial treatments. Efficacy of CBT in relapse prevention was observed in one RCT, 85 but not in another larger RCT, at least in patients who had multiple mood episodes. 86 From meta‐analyses, effects on either depressive symptoms or on relapse remain uncertain due to important methodological problems and study selection factors. 87, 88, 89 A promising new direction in CBT has been established by a pilot study of "recovery‐focused CBT" where 33 subjects received the novel CBT intervention, with evidence of reduction of relapse in the intervention group. 90 Group CBT in euthymic patients with BD is also a new direction and has shown to increase time in remission. 91

In MDD, CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and behavioural activation have been explored in multiple RCTs and in general display similar efficacies. 92 Based on this and the findings of the study by Miklowitz and colleagues in acute bipolar depression, 84 CBT is still recommended as an adjunctive second‐line treatment for acute bipolar depression (level 2). The recommendation is also second‐line for maintenance treatment (level 2) for patients with fewer episodes and less severe form of illness. No evidence exists, and hence no recommendation is made, for CBT in mania.

### Sequential treatment of mood and anxiety disorders [^112p2fX6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Administration of treatments in a sequential order is a common practice in clinical medicine, but has received insufficient attention in psychiatry. The aim of this review was to survey the literature concerned with a sequential use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in mood and anxiety disturbances.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A review of the clinical trials in which treatment components were used in a sequential order (i.e., pharmacotherapy followed by psychotherapy, psychotherapy followed by pharmacotherapy, one drug treatment following another, or one psychotherapeutic technique following another) was performed. Studies were identified by using MEDLINE (English language articles published from 1967 to March 2005; keywords: sequential treatment, drugs and psychotherapy, combined treatment related to depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, mania, anxiety disorders, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) and a manual search of the literature and Index Medicus for the years 1960 to 2005.

Data Synthesis

In unipolar recurrent depression, the sequential use of pharmacotherapy was found to reduce relapse rate. In bipolar disorder, the use of psychotherapeutic strategies in patients who were already undergoing treatment with mood stabilizers was also found to yield clinical benefits. In anxiety disorders, the sequential use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy was not found to improve long-term outcome.

Conclusion

The sequential treatment of mood and anxiety disorders does not fall within the realm of maintenance strategies. It is an intensive, 2-stage approach, which is based on the fact that one course of treatment with a specific treatment (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to entail solution to the complex array of symptoms of patients with mood and anxiety disorders. The sequential model introduces a conceptual shift in current assessment methods.

### Aripiprazole: a clinical review of its use for the treatment of anxiety disorders and anxiety as a comorbidity in mental illness [^11617zhz]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although anxiety disorders are common, optimal treatment is elusive. More than half of anxiety patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve: treatment resistance, residual symptoms, and recurrence/relapse remain a challenge. Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been considered for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. This review will explore the available data for the role of aripiprazole in the treatment of anxiety.

Methods

PubMed and conference abstracts were searched for randomized, double-blind studies that investigated the efficacy of aripiprazole in anxiety; its efficacy in bipolar disorder and depression was also explored for comparison.

Results

A number of studies have shown atypical antipsychotics to be effective in anxiety, and currently available data suggest that aripiprazole augmentation in patients with anxiety disorders is likely as effective as other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Although there have been no randomized, controlled trials, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in two open-label trials. This combined with the larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration.

Limitations

Data from large randomized, controlled trials on the use of atypical antipsychotics for anxiety in general, and aripiprazole in particular, are currently lacking.

Conclusion

The results of open-label trials of aripiprazole in anxiety provide enough support to warrant its further study. This, combined with a larger data base demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile and its unique mechanism of action, make aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy: applications for the management of bipolar disorder [^113yQTnF]. Bipolar Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper reviews cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bipolar disorder (BD). Data on the poor outcome of about 50% of patients diagnosed with BD supports the addition of a psychosocial intervention for the treatment of this recurring disorder. The psychoeducational nature of CBT, the effectiveness of CBT in increasing compliance to pharmacological treatment, and the ability of CBT to prevent relapse in unipolar depression (UD) are well suited to the treatment of BD.

Method

Psychosocial interventions for BD will be briefly reviewed. Individual and group CBT interventions (published and unpublished) will also be reviewed. The significance of comorbid anxiety disorders regarding response to treatment will also be discussed. A review of the treatment protocol with the specific cognitive-behavioral interventions as applied to BD will be presented. Finally, a case example will be presented to illustrate the application of CBT to BD.

Results

Preliminary results indicate that CBT may be an effective adjunctive, intervention for the treatment of BD. Specifically CBT may be helpful in increasing compliance, improving quality of life and functioning, help early symptom recognition, decrease relapse and decrease depressive symptomatology.

Conclusions

Preliminary data on CBT for BD are promising but more rigorous randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of CBT for BD. An other area of research should be to pursue the understanding of cognitive processes in BD which would allow us to refine and develop CBT interventions unique to this disorder.

### Transdiagnostic treatment of bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety using the unified protocol for emotional disorders: a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial [^114XG3kQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with greater illness severity, reduced treatment response, and greater impairment. Treating anxiety in the context of BD is crucial for improving illness course and outcomes. The current study examined the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy, as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for BD and comorbid anxiety disorders.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients with BD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomized to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU with 18 sessions of the UP (UP+TAU). All patients completed assessments every four weeks to track symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation and temperament. Linear mixed-model regressions were conducted to track symptom changes over time and to examine the relationship between emotion-related variables and treatment response.

Results

Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohen's d's > 0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms.

Limitations

This was a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial; results should be interpreted with caution.

Conclusions

Treatment with the UP+TAU was rated high in patient satisfaction, and resulted in significantly greater improvement on indices of anxiety and depression relative to TAU. This suggests that the UP may be a feasible treatment approach for BD with comorbid anxiety.

Treatment recommendations

Treatment strategies that target metabolic disorders should include non‐pharmacological lifestyle interventions. Replacing "high metabolic risk" psychiatric medications with medications that have a more favourable profile is highly recommended if the therapeutic advantage of the high‐risk agent over the alternative is minimal and metabolic/weight issues persist. Bariatric surgery should be considered following unsuccessful attempts at the aforementioned strategies if the individual has a BMI ≥ 27 with weight‐related morbidity or a BMI ≥ 30 without significant metabolic morbidity. Readers are referred to the CANMAT Task Force report 785 for further detailed discussion on foundational principles for managing metabolic conditions in patients with BD.

While there is no evidence specifically regarding treatment of comorbid dyslipidaemia or hypertension in BD, it is noteworthy that many of the medications used to manage these comorbid medical disorders have epidemiological or even clinical trial evidence that they may benefit mood. Examples include statins, aspirin and angiotensin antagonists. 788, 789, 790, 791, 792, 793 The implications are that clinicians should be actively engaged in the management of these disorders, and should select therapies from those agents that may have benefit in mood symptoms. This again is concordant with the notion of shared risk pathways for these non‐communicable disorders.

Bipolar depression

There are no RCTs of any agents in older adults with acute bipolar depression. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest efficacy of quetiapine (level 2) 661 and lurasidone (level 2) 662 monotherapy and hence these are recommended as first‐line options. However, in older adults, given the concerns about side effects of atypical antipsychotics, clinicians may wish to try lithium or lamotrigine first based on their efficacy in adult populations, although the evidence of efficacy is limited in older adults (lithium, level 4; lamotrigine, level 4). 663, 664 Divalproex (level 4), aripiprazole (level 4), 658 and carbamazepine (level 4) 665 are third‐line options. ECT (level 4) 654 is an important option that should be considered in treatment‐resistant cases, for suicidal patients, or for patients with inadequate food or fluid intake.

While the use of antidepressants in BD remains controversial 260, 426 and there have been no studies in older age BD; antidepressants are frequently used in this population (> 40% of patients). 666 Antidepressants with lower manic switch potential (eg, SSRIs and bupropion) 260 used in combination with mood stabilizers may be beneficial in selected patients who cannot tolerate/do not respond to other agents with a stronger geriatric evidence base. Possible medication interactions with ongoing medications for non‐psychiatric conditions must always be considered.

Maintenance

Choice of agents should be based on what has been effective in the acute phase, with recommended options with geriatric efficacy data being lithium (level 2), 667, 668 lamotrigine (level 2), 668 and divalproex (level 3). 667

### The comorbidity of bipolar and anxiety disorders: prevalence, psychobiology, and treatment issues [^1164V6N3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although symptoms of anxiety as well as anxiety disorders commonly occur in patients with bipolar disorder, the pathophysiologic, theoretical, and clinical significance of their co-occurrence has not been well studied.

Methods

The epidemiological and clinical studies that have assessed the overlap of bipolar and anxiety disorders are reviewed, with focus on panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and to a lesser extent, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder. Potential neural mechanism and treatment response data are also reviewed.

Results

A growing number of epidemiological studies have found that bipolar disorder significantly co-occurs with anxiety disorders at rates that are higher than those in the general population. Clinical studies have also demonstrated high comorbidity between bipolar disorder and panic disorder, OCD, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychobiological mechanisms that may account for these high comorbidity rates likely involve a complicated interplay among various neurotransmitter systems, particularly norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin. The second-messenger system constituent, inositol, may also be involved. Little controlled data are available regarding the treatment of bipolar disorder complicated by an anxiety disorder. However, adequate mood stabilization should be achieved before antidepressants are used to treat residual anxiety symptoms so as to minimize antidepressant-induced mania or cycling. Moreover, preliminary data suggesting that certain antimanic agents may have anxiolytic properties (e.g. valproate and possibly antipsychotics), and that some anxiolytics may not induce mania (e.g. gabapentin and benzodiazepines other than alprazolam) indicate that these agents may be particularly useful for anxious bipolar patients.

Conclusions

Comorbid anxiety symptoms and disorders must be considered when diagnosing and treating patients with bipolar disorder. Conversely, patients presenting with anxiety disorders must be assessed for comorbid mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. Pathophysiological, theoretical, and clinical implications of the overlap of bipolar and anxiety disorders are discussed.

### Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in bipolar disorder: preliminary evaluation of immediate effects on between-episode functioning [^112Nj76Z]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Pharmacological treatment has been the treatment of choice for patients with bipolar disorder for many years. However, even with good maintenance medication, 73% of patients relapse within 5 years. Poorer overall outcome is associated with a high rate of comorbidity, particularly with anxiety disorders, which are present in approximately 64% of bipolar patients. Therefore, psychological interventions have assumed increasing interest as a way of improving mood stability. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) has had the clearest claims to be a specific intervention based broadly on Beck's ideas about how cognitions shape mood. However, initially promising findings have not been confirmed in what was intended to be a definitive trial.

Recently, our group has been investigating the usefulness of a new psychological treatment for patients with a history of suicidality. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines aspects of cognitive therapy with training in meditation. MBCT teaches people skills that enable them to become more aware of their thoughts without judgment, viewing negative (positive and neutral) thoughts as passing mental events rather than as facts. MBCT has proven effective in preventing relapse in recurrent depression. The treatment is closely based on an approach that is known to be helpful in the treatment of anxiety disorders (Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction:), so this study provides an opportunity to evaluate its impact on between-episode anxiety in bipolar patients.

Our research has been concerned with the application of MBCT to those patients who become suicidal when depressed. Because bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide, we included patients with this diagnosis in a randomized controlled trial we were conducting. It has been estimated that between 10% and 15% of hospitalized bipolar patients die from suicide and the risk factors include depression and anxiety comorbidity. This suggests that therapeutic efforts to target any of these correlates might have an impact on the illness morbidity and perhaps mortality.

In summary, this study aimed to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of MBCT for people with bipolar disorder, using data collected from a pilot randomized controlled trial of MBCT for people with a history of suicidal ideation or behaviour. The study hypothesis was that MBCT would improve between-episode anxiety and depressive symptoms.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) collaborative update of CANMAT guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2013 [^111p1MiM]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with updates in 2007 and 2009. This third update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain largely unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotic agents continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Monotherapy with asenapine, paliperidone extended release (ER), and divalproex ER, as well as adjunctive asenapine, have been added as first-line options. For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, as well as olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. Lurasidone monotherapy and the combination of lurasidone or lamotrigine plus lithium or divalproex have been added as a second-line options. Ziprasidone alone or as adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive levetiracetam have been added as not-recommended options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone long-acting injection, and adjunctive ziprasidone continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Asenapine alone or as adjunctive therapy have been added as third-line options.

### Bipolar disorder [^116YeZEL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) affects approximately 2% of U.S. adults and is the most costly mental health condition for commercial insurers nationwide. Rates of BD are elevated among persons with depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders-conditions frequently seen by primary care clinicians. In addition, antidepressants can precipitate manic or hypomanic symptoms or rapid cycling in persons with undiagnosed BD. Thus, screening in these high-risk groups is indicated. Effective treatments exist, and many can be safely and effectively administered by primary care clinicians.

Opioid use disorder

While methadone has the most evidence of efficacy in comorbid BD and opioid use disorder (level 3), 716, 717 because of the lack of research in this area and increasing concern related to risk of overdose, clinicians should consult the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM) national treatment guidelines on primary opioid use disorder when available (anticipated 2018) for further advice on managing opioid use disorders in their patients.

Others

Olanzapine add‐on therapy was effective in decreasing manic symptoms and measures of substance use such as reduction in cravings in hospitalized inpatients (level 2). 718 Aripiprazole has level 4 evidence to decrease craving of alcohol, but not consumption, and level 4 evidence to decrease cocaine use in polysubstance users. 719

Clinicians are advised to appropriately dose these medications for an adequate period of time before concluding lack of efficacy. Clinical trials have shown that there is no difference in efficacy between quetiapine 300mg and 600mg daily doses. Lower doses of quetiapine have not been studied in clinical trials for bipolar depression. Therefore, clinicians are advised to consider a target dose of 300 mg/day for quetiapine. For lithium, we suggest that serum lithium levels should be maintained between 0.8 and 1.2 meq/L, while for lamotrigine, the target should be a minimum of 200 mg/day.

4.2.2 Suicide risk

Principles related to management of suicidal ideation and risk (see Section 2 and 47) are of utmost importance during depressive episodes, as > 70% of suicide deaths and suicide attempts in patients with BD occur during this phase. 230, 231 Depressive episodes with mixed features are a particularly dangerous period associated with even higher short‐term risks of suicide attempts or death. 232 Overall, it is imperative for clinicians to review risk factors (Table 9) and determine an appropriate treatment setting to address any safety issues. All patients at risk should be encouraged to develop and share a written safety plan listing coping strategies and sources of support which may be applied during times of crisis. As described in Section 2, the most common method of suicide in this population is self‐poisoning, and so potential benefits of various treatments should be considered against their risk of toxicity and lethality. One study found that there were fewer deaths due to lethal lithium levels compared to carbamazepine, and that opioids and benzodiazepines were the most common medication classes ingested at lethal levels — noteworthy given the lack of efficacy of these agents in the disorder. 55

4.2.3 Cognitive and functional impairment

Part of the impact of acute and subsyndromal depressive symptoms on functional impairment is thought to be mediated through cognitive performance, which is both subjectively and objectively impaired in bipolar depression and linked to poor psychosocial function. 233, 234, 235, 236

Because of the important link between cognition and functioning, 237 attention should be paid to avoiding treatments that may further exacerbate cognitive difficulties 238 (see Section 8). Although evidence for their efficacy is limited, cognitive enhancement therapies can be considered experimental in this population. 72, 239, 240

4.3 Psychological interventions for acute bipolar I depression

While pharmacotherapy is essential and forms the foundation for successful treatment of BD, adjunctive psychosocial interventions may also be useful for acute depressive episodes. As described in Section 2, there are no first‐line psychosocial treatment options for acute bipolar depression. Selecting between second‐line options such as CBT (level 2) and FFT (level 2), as well as the third‐line option IPSRT (level 3), should be based on individual strengths and needs.

### Mindfulness-based cognitive therapytreatment as usual in people with bipolar disorder: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^112NRbF5]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) seems a promising intervention for bipolar disorder (BD), but there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating this. The purpose of this multicentre, evaluator blinded RCT was to investigate the added value of MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) in BD up to 15 months follow-up (NCT03507647).

Methods

A total of 144 participants with BD type I and II were randomised to MBCT + TAU (n = 72) and TAU (n = 72). Primary outcome was current depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were current (hypo)manic and anxiety symptoms, recurrence rates, rumination, dampening of positive affect, functional impairment, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and positive mental health. Potential moderators of treatment outcome were examined.

Results

MBCT + TAU was not more efficacious than TAU in reducing current depressive symptoms at post-treatment (95% CI [-7.0 to 1.8], p = 0.303, d = 0.24) or follow-up (95% CI [-2.2 to 6.3], p = 0.037, d = 0.13). At post-treatment, MBCT + TAU was more effective than TAU in improving mindfulness skills. At follow-up, TAU was more effective than MBCT + TAU in reducing trait anxiety and improving mindfulness skills and positive mental health. Exploratory analysis revealed that participants with higher depressive symptoms and functional impairment at baseline benefitted more from MBCT + TAU than TAU.

Conclusions

In these participants with highly recurrent BD, MBCT may be a treatment option in addition to TAU for those who suffer from moderate to severe levels of depression and functional impairment.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114aDL74]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

First‐line combination therapy

Combination therapy with the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine (level 1), aripiprazole (level 2), risperidone (level 1), or asenapine (level 2) and lithium or divalproex is also recommended as first‐line treatment options with greater efficacy than monotherapy with lithium or divalproex alone, especially in those with higher index severity. 144

In general, combination therapy is preferred to mood stabilizer monotherapy because clinical trials suggest that on average about 20% more patients will respond to combination therapy. 142, 145, 146 There is also some evidence to suggest the benefit of combination therapy compared to atypical antipsychotic monotherapy, although there are fewer trials. Specifically, lithium plus quetiapine showed superiority to quetiapine alone. 147 While there is also level 1 evidence for olanzapine combination therapy over olanzapine monotherapy, this is downgraded to second‐line due to tolerability/safety concerns with olanzapine.

The decision to treat with one or a combination of available first‐line agents should be informed by current and prior medication use, with treatment previously shown to be successful in managing symptoms preferred. Safety and tolerability factors for each medication and clinical features predictive of better response (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices") should also be considered. In general, combination therapy is associated with more adverse events than monotherapy. Whenever possible, options should be discussed with the patient and/or their caregiver and their preferences considered prior to treatment selection.

If symptoms are not controlled using monotherapy or combination therapy with first‐line agents, dosing should be optimized, issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed, and consideration given to possible substance use (Section 4) prior to adding or switching therapies (Step 3). Given that almost all antimanic agents separated from placebo within 1 week, some therapeutic response is expected with antimanic agents within 1‐2 weeks. If no response is observed within 2 weeks with therapeutic doses of antimanic agents, and other contributing factors for non‐response are excluded, then switch or add‐on strategies should be considered.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) collaborative update of CANMAT guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2009 [^115seu7m]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with a 2007 update. This second update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Tamoxifen is now suggested as a third-line augmentation option. The combination of olanzapine and carbamazepine is not recommended. For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. New data support the use of adjunctive modafinil as a second-line option, but also indicate that aripiprazole should not be used as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, and olanzapine continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. New data support the use of quetiapine monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for the prevention of manic and depressive events, aripiprazole monotherapy for the prevention of manic events, and risperidone long-acting injection monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive ziprasidone for the prevention of mood events. Bipolar II disorder is frequently overlooked in treatment guidelines, but has an important clinical impact on patients' lives. This update provides an expanded look at bipolar II disorder.

### Comparing the effectiveness of imagery focussed cognitive therapy to group psychoeducation for patients with bipolar disorder: a randomised trial [^115L7yYJ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic mental disorder. Treatment options are limited, with pharmacological approaches continuing to dominate. However, relapse rates remain high. Several adjunctive psychosocial interventions, mostly psychoeducation (PE) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), have been trialled, but treatment innovation is still needed. In the past, brief group PE has proven as beneficial as longer individual CBT in reducing levels of depression and increasing self-management strategies. We compared the relative effectiveness of group PE to an imagery focussed cognitive behavioural therapy (ImCT).

Study Design

This was a randomised parallel group study with both daily and weekly measures. A total of 62 adult patients were randomly allocated to either ImCT or group PE. Daily, weekly and pre-and post-intervention measures were used to assess impact on (i) mood instability, (ii) overall levels of depression, anxiety and mania, and (iii) general functioning, hopelessness and imagery characteristics. A four-week baseline and 16-week follow-up period were included.

Results

Mood instability reduced in both conditions after intervention. Levels of mania, depression and anxiety also reduced in both conditions, but on the daily measures, depression and anxiety significantly more so in the ImCT condition. Compared with the PE condition, the ImCT condition additionally showed increased level of functioning, reduced hopelessness, and a decrease in intrusive, problematic imagery.

Limitations

These findings need to be replicated in a larger trial.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that ImCT is a promising new avenue for management of bipolar disorder, an area in which treatment development is urgently needed.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111YKXKv]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Acute bipolar depression — quetiapine monotherapy is recommended with strong strength, supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analytic data showing symptom improvement and higher response/remission versus placebo. We recommend quetiapine as monotherapy for acute bipolar depression. (Strong for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence includes a systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis that reviewed 11 RCTs in individuals with BD 1 or mixed BD 1 and BD 2, with moderate quality. Quantitatively, the standardized mean difference (SMD) for improvement over 2–36 weeks was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.14–0.82); other findings reported OR 1.87 (95% CI: 1.62–2.17) for response and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.50–2.49) for remission, while analyses limited to BD 1 found no significant differences from placebo. Additional evidence from a more recent RCT with high quality reported effectiveness for both BD 1 and BD 2, and together the evidence indicates quetiapine can reduce current symptoms and, when continued, can prevent recurrences of depression and the onset of mania; one RCT in an SR also suggests possible benefit for comorbid anxiety in individuals with BD.

2 APPROACHES TO PATIENTS AND FAMILIES

There are also a number of principles of optimal patient treatment that need to be considered, including: safety and tolerability; willingness to tolerate and report side effects, willingness to try treatments supported by progressively less evidence after more promising and better validated treatments have failed; and to take medicines for the long term. If a patient or family member is able to provide a consistent longitudinal numerical or graphic depiction of mood, behavior, sleep, side effects, and ancillary or comorbid syndromes such as anxiety and substance abuse disorders, the evaluation of treatment effectiveness or nonresponsiveness for that individual patient becomes vastly more efficient, reliable, and valid. We thus strongly encourage the systematic use of such a mood chart in the context of other psycho‐educational and psychotherapeutic approaches to the illness to augment pharmacotherapy. Ultimately, the goal is to construct a learning healthcare system consortium with clinicians, patients, researchers, administrators, and to provide data on the outcomes of these treatments. Such an approach is also essential in bringing the patient into the therapeutic alliance and providing comprehensive informed consent.

Especially when revealed by longitudinal mood charting, we consider that an individual patient's responsiveness, nonresponsiveness, or intolerance of a given drug trumps any FDA approval status or treatment guideline. Guidelines make the assumption of pristine diagnostic clarity, whereas real‐world patients have extensive comorbidity, diagnostic uncertainty and shifting diagnostic classifications. Given the many major differences of recommendations in this manuscript to those generated in most treatment guidelines constructed on the basis of a strong reliance on RCTs, we acknowledge that many recommendations in this manuscript will be debated by many clinicians and investigators who may differ with rankings or sequences of drugs suggested. The suggestions offered should thus be considered highly preliminary.

In fact it is hoped that the long list of basic unanswered questions about the optimal treatment of bipolar disorder in virtually every stage of illness evolution will help engender new research efforts, and that the suggestions generated here can rapidly be modified as new data become available. Since this is not likely to occur rapidly, the authors also hope that many of controversial recommendations would generate further discussion and critiques in the published literature.

### Challenges in the management of bipolar depression [^111tLRp5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression has started to receive more attention in clinical trials only relatively recently, despite the fact that patients spend more time in the depressed phase than in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging, and many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression or other illnesses and/or comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness and is associated with a greater risk of suicide. Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to their potential risk of switching patients into mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in bipolar depression, although longer-term studies are warranted. The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and also needs further study. Other important issues that require further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment, as well as the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.

3.3.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behaviour, violence and safety threat to others, suicide risk especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted, but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient).

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition (although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis). Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of BD, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring patients for a period of time after antidepressant discontinuation and obtain collateral information to confirm whether symptoms remain and antimanic treatment is necessary. Patients should also be supported to discontinue stimulant use, including caffeine and alcohol. Current and prior therapies should be assessed, including appropriateness of medications, dosing, and trough serum levels (where indicated), as well as past response; and this should be used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Attention should be paid to managing withdrawal symptoms that may occur in manic patients with histories of substance abuse.

When the symptoms of mania have remitted, behavioural and educational strategies should be applied to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

3.3.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended that, for all patients (including those who are untreated as well as those receiving a non‐first‐line treatment), therapy be initiated with one of the available first‐line monotherapy or combination treatments.

First‐line

Quetiapine (level 1), 241, 242, 243 lithium (level 2), 244, 245, 246 lamotrigine (level 2) 242, 247, 248 and lurasidone (level 2) 249 are all recommended as first‐line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy.

Lurasidone (level 1) 249, 250 and lamotrigine (level 2) 251, 252 are also recommended as first‐line adjunctive treatments (Figure 2). Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of either of these medications.

Figure 2
Lithium and lamotrigine as first‐line agents for bipolar I depression: Summary of evidence > [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Recommendations as to which first‐line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient‐specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/ non‐response or clinical features (see Clinical features which help direct treatment choices). For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non‐response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient had been taking lithium and either had a breakthrough acute bipolar depressive episode or did not respond to monotherapy with lithium, then lurasidone or lamotrigine or quetiapine add‐on or switch to quetiapine monotherapy or lurasidone monotherapy might be more appropriate in that order, given that lurasidone and lamotrigine adjunctive therapies have demonstrated efficacy in lithium non‐responders. Similarly, in non‐responders to lithium monotherapy, adjunctive lamotrigine could be another option.

### Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in bipolar disorder: preliminary evaluation of immediate effects on between-episode functioning [^1168jtzn]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is highly recurrent and rates of comorbidity are high. Studies have pointed to anxiety comorbidity as one factor associated with risk of suicide attempts and poor overall outcome. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of a new psychological treatment (Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy: MBCT) for people with bipolar disorder focusing on between-episode anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Methods

The study used data from a pilot randomized trial of MBCT for people with bipolar disorder in remission, focusing on between-episode anxiety and depressive symptoms. Immediate effects of MBCT versus waitlist on levels of anxiety and depression were compared between unipolar and bipolar participants.

Results

The results suggest that MBCT led to improved immediate outcomes in terms of anxiety which were specific to the bipolar group. Both bipolar and unipolar participants allocated to MBCT showed reductions in residual depressive symptoms relative to those allocated to the waitlist condition.

Limitations

Analyses were based on a small sample, limiting power. Additionally the study recruited participants with suicidal ideation or behaviour so the findings cannot immediately be generalized to individuals without these symptoms.

Conclusions

The study, although preliminary, suggests an immediate effect of MBCT on anxiety and depressive symptoms among bipolar participants with suicidal ideation or behaviour, and indicates that further research into the use of MBCT with bipolar patients may be warranted.

2.2.1 DSM‐5 diagnostic criteria

Bipolar disorder encompasses a spectrum of diagnostic subgroups primarily divided according to the severity of mood elevation experienced during acute episodes 5 On this spectrum, BDI is placed at one pole due to the presence of threshold manic episodes in which features include inflated self‐esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and risky behaviour that leads to significant functional impairment, and may include psychotic features, and/or necessitate hospitalization. At the other end of the spectrum, cyclothymia is characterized by subthreshold presentation of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that, while chronic, do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode or manic/hypomanic episode. BDII sits between the two conditions with hypomanic episodes qualitatively like manic periods but, although distinct and observable, are not of a sufficient duration or severity to cause significant functional impairment, hospitalization, or psychosis. Individuals with BDII also experience threshold depressive episodes.

DSM‐5 has replaced the BD not otherwise specified (NOS) category in DSM‐IV with two new categories; other specified bipolar and related disorder and unspecified bipolar and related disorder. Also, DSM‐5 includes substance/medication‐induced bipolar and related disorder and bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. For more detailed discussion of diagnostic categories, the reader is advised to consult DSM‐5 and recent Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists guidelines for treatment of mood disorders. 27

2.2.2 DSM‐5 specifiers for bipolar and related disorders

DSM‐5 also includes a range of specifiers that clinicians may use to further clarify the specific course, severity, and features of BDs. While a more detailed description can be found in the DSM‐5 manual, the available specifiers and their use across the spectrum are listed in Table 5 Many of these specifiers may also be used to guide treatment decisions for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4). Amongst these, the mixed features specifier, which has replaced mixed episodes, warrants consideration because of the multiple and complex presentations of mixed states it can give rise to. Furthermore, the nascency of this terminology has meant that treatment data are as yet sparse. DSM‐5 has added mixed features as a specifier during an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well, which will probably pose some pragmatic diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas for clinicians.

### Comparison of antidepressant use between subjects with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with or without comorbid anxiety [^116EBpn9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Antidepressants are recommended for the treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder, but caution is urged when used for the treatment of these symptoms in bipolar disorder. It is not known whether these differing recommendations are reflected in clinical practice, as comparative analyses of rates of antidepressant use between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder subjects with or without comorbid anxiety have not been reported.

Method

Data source was the Canadian Community Health Survey on Mental Health and Well-Being, a large, representative mental health survey conducted from May to December 2002. Rates of antidepressant use were compared for subjects with bipolar disorder according to the World Mental Health-Composite International Diagnostic Interview or major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, with or without comorbid anxiety (DSM-IV). The independent effects of the diagnostic group and of a comorbid anxiety disorder were determined by controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables using logistic regression.

Results

Rate of antidepressant use was significantly higher among all subjects with bipolar disorder (N = 756) compared with all subjects with major depressive disorder (N = 3863) (27.2% vs. 23.1%, p = .02), but this difference was no longer significant when other factors were controlled for in the regression analysis. With the major depressive disorder without anxiety group as the reference, the likelihood of antidepressant use was significantly higher in both the bipolar disorder with anxiety group (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.02 to 3.27, p = .04) and the major depressive disorder with anxiety group (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.09, p = .05).

Conclusion

After sociodemographic and clinical variables were controlled for, similar rates of antidepressant use were identified among bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder subjects. Further efforts are needed to enhance screening for bipolar disorder among depressed patients and to re-examine the risk/benefit analysis of antidepressants for bipolar disorder patients in light of emerging alternatives. Significantly increased rates of antidepressant use in subjects with a comorbid anxiety disorder suggest that anxiety symptoms may be a key reason why physicians are choosing to prescribe antidepressants for patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.

### Bipolar depression: a new role for atypical antipsychotics? [^111PEYHY]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression, the most common phase of bipolar disorder, causes significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional drugs such as lithium, lamotrigine or antidepressants each offer some clinical efficacy; however, efficacy can be limited and side effects are sometimes problematic. Thus there is a major unmet need for effective, well-tolerated agents for the treatment of bipolar depression. The atypical antipsychotics, with their proven efficacy against manic symptoms, are emerging as candidates for use against the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Several studies have shown that some atypicals improve depressive symptoms in mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder; however, few studies have been performed in patients specifically with bipolar depressive episodes. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute bipolar I depression, olanzapine monotherapy and an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination significantly improved Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) with corresponding effect sizes (improvement of active treatment over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.32 and 0.68, respectively. Importantly, there were no significant differences in rates of switch into mania among the three groups. Recent results from an 8-week, randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar I and II disorder who were experiencing a bipolar depressive episode showed that quetiapine (300 and 600 mg/day) had significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo in improving the core symptoms of depression, including suicidal thoughts. Quetiapine significantly improved MADRS total scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001); effect sizes (improvement of quetiapine over placebo divided by pooled standard deviation) of 0.66 and 0.80 for 300 and 600 mg/day quetiapine, respectively, were observed. Both doses of quetiapine significantly improved symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and global quality of life (all, p < 0.001 versus placebo). These initial findings suggest that atypical antipsychotics may prove to be important future treatments for patients with bipolar depression.

Figure 3
Armodafinil and modafinil as third‐line agents for bipolar I depression: Summary of evidence [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Ancillary treatments such as adjunctive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (level 2), 169, 279, 280 N ‐acetylcysteine (level 3), 281 and light therapy (level 3), 282 including bright light delivered midday (level 3), 283 are also recommended as third‐line treatment options to use adjunctively to other medications. There may be additional benefits to using light therapy in combination with total sleep deprivation (level 2), although there is little clinical experience with this technique. While there is evidence from several small studies that intravenous ketamine (level 3) 284 is a highly effective and fast‐acting antidepressant, due to its invasive nature, short duration of effect, and lack of long‐term safety data, it has been relegated to a third‐line treatment, with recommendations that it be reserved for patients with severe symptoms or significant suicidal ideation for whom other treatments have been unsuccessful. In clinical situations that prioritize rapidity of response to treatment, ketamine may be considered earlier in the treatment order, although clinicians need to be aware that the data for efficacy are limited and the effects do not appear to last longer. Further, there are case reports of manic switch, but the clinical trial data have not provided any confirmatory evidence. 284 Also, clinicians need to be aware of potential abuse of ketamine, especially in domiciliary use situations. 285

4.4.6 Agents not recommended for the treatment of acute bipolar depression

Antidepressants should not be used as monotherapy in patients with BDI depression, as available trials do not support their efficacy and there are concerns about their safety in terms of mood switching (level 2 negative). 260, 289, 290, 291

Aripiprazole monotherapy failed to separate from placebo in two bipolar depression trials. 292 Although the pooled analysis reported separation, 293 the mean difference in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) change score was only 1.12 points, which is not clinically meaningful and it is thus not recommended (level 1 negative). Ziprasidone monotherapy or adjunctive therapy (level 1 negative), 242, 294 lamotrigine in combination with folic acid (level 2 negative), 251 and mifepristone (adjunctive) (Leve 2 negative) 295 are also not recommended due to evidence for lack of antidepressant efficacy (Table 15).

### Anxiety disorder comobidity in bipolar I disorder: relationship to depression severity and treatment outcome [^1134UfNA]. Depression and Anxiety (2005). Low credibility.

The present study investigated the greater symptom severity and poorer treatment response found in patients with bipolar illness and anxiety comorbidity, and examined depression as a potential mediator of this relationship. The sample consisted of 92 patients in an acute episode of Bipolar I Disorder with a current or past history of an anxiety disorder. Diagnoses were based on structured clinical interview, and participants were assessed at pre-treatment and then randomly assigned to pharmacotherapy alone or pharmacotherapy plus family intervention. Patients were assessed on a monthly basis by blind assessors over 28 months. Compared to patients without anxiety comorbidity, individuals with bipolar disorder and an anxiety disorder possessed greater current symptom severity, even after controlling for depression severity. Logistic regression analysis identified that being female and having higher current depression but not manic severity predicted comorbid anxiety. Comorbid anxiety was associated with poorer treatment response in the sample regardless of treatment type, particularly in subsequent depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analyses indicated that current depression but not manic severity partially mediated the relationship between comorbid anxiety and treatment outcome. Results from the current study investigating comorbid anxiety disorders are consistent with past research limited to anxiety symptoms. Depression only partially accounted for the link between comorbid anxiety and greater symptom severity and poorer treatment response, and examination of other factors is warranted. Because of the clinical relevance of comorbid anxiety in severe affective disorders, treatments designed to specifically address both concerns are needed.

Maintenance treatment

The data in paediatric samples are very limited. These recommendations are therefore informed by clinical experience and studies in adults to a greater extent than the above acute mania recommendations.

First‐line. Preferred maintenance treatment options for this population are aripiprazole (level 2), 602, 603 lithium (level 2) 604 and divalproex (level 2). 604, 605 However, it should be noted that follow‐up duration for the aripiprazole study was only 30 weeks, and the sample size in the 18‐month maintenance study of lithium vs divalproex was only 30 participants. It is important to note that few patients continued to do well upon the switch to either lithium or divalproex monotherapy and the majority re‐responded when the combination was reinstated. Further, other studies have also suggested the efficacy of combination therapy (eg, risperidone plus lithium or divalproex 584 and lithium plus divalproex or carbamazepine 606) to achieve and maintain remission. Adjunctive lamotrigine may also be considered for those aged ≥ 13 years (level 2). 607

Second‐line. No treatments with level 3 or higher evidence are available to recommend as second‐line options for maintenance.

Third‐line. Although there has been far less experience with asenapine than with other medications discussed in this section, a recent open‐label extension study suggests continual reduction in manic symptoms over 50 weeks (level 4). 608 Further, a recent RCT in adults confirmed its efficacy in preventing relapse of mood episodes. 374 Although there have not been maintenance studies for quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone in this population, clinical experience and open‐label studies indicate that continuation and maintenance treatment with these medications is another option, particularly for those patients who have responded well to acute treatment (level 4). 591, 609, 610 Further, there is evidence that oral quetiapine and long‐acting injectable risperidone monotherapy and adjunctive therapy and oral ziprasidone adjunctive therapy are effective in preventing mood episodes in adults with BD. 369, 370, 383, 384, 387

### Comorbid anxiety in bipolar CHOICE: insights from the bipolar inventory of symptoms scale [^111h1Agv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 86–89% of patients with BD have a comorbid anxiety disorder associated with poor quality of life and reduced likelihood of recovery from an acute mood episode. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and impact of comorbid anxiety using the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) in patients with BD who participated in a 6-month pragmatic trial.

Methods

Participants (N = 482) in the Bipolar Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness (CHOICE) study were adults with BD I or II. Anxiety diagnoses were assessed with the MINI. Global illness severity was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Version. Mood symptoms and anxiety severity were assessed using the BISS.

Results

61% of the study sample met criteria for a current anxiety disorder. Patients with a higher BISS anxiety score at baseline had a higher overall BD illness severity, depressive severity, and manic episode severity (p < 0.001). A single cutoff value of BISS anxiety had great sensitivity, yet poor specificity for determining a comorbid anxiety diagnosis. There were no significant differences in outcomes for individuals treated for anxiety disorders with anxiolytics compared with those who were not treated with anxiolytics.

Limitations

Sample size limitations prevented an analysis of whether the BISS cutoff score of 10 performed differently across varied anxiety disorders.

Conclusions

Given its ability to identify patients with co-occurring anxiety, the BISS anxiety subscale shows clinical utility as a screening measure though its application as a clinical assessment measure may not be advisable.

### Residual anxiety may be associated with depressive relapse during continuation therapy of bipolar II depression [^115BiYdd]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety symptoms are common in bipolar disorder. We explored the effect of anxiety on the outcome of acute and continuation pharmacotherapy of bipolar II depression.

Methods

Data were derived from a randomized double-blind 12-week acute (N = 129) and 6-month continuation (N = 55) comparison of venlafaxine versus lithium monotherapy in bipolar II depression in adults. We distinguished between the items of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) that capture depression vs. anxiety (i.e., psychomotor agitation, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-compulsive concerns) and examined the effect of treatment on depression and anxiety. Additionally, we explored whether baseline anxiety or depression predicted changes over time in depression and anxiety ratings or moderated treatment outcomes. We also explored whether residual depressive and anxious symptoms predicted relapse during continuation therapy.

Results

Venlafaxine was superior to lithium in reducing both depression and anxiety, though its effects on anxiety were more modest than those on depression. Baseline anxiety predicted change over time in anxiety, but not depression. By contrast, baseline depression did not predict change over time in depression or anxiety. Residual anxiety, specifically uncontrollable worry, was a stronger predictor of relapse than residual depression.

Conclusion

Successful treatment of symptoms of anxiety in bipolar depression may protect against depressive relapse.

### Empirically supported psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder: current state of the research [^116gaA4i]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bipolar disorder requires psychiatric medications, but even guideline-concordant treatment fails to bring many patients to remission or keep them euthymic. To address this gap, researchers have developed adjunctive psychotherapies. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the evidence for the efficacy of manualized psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder.

Methods

We conducted a search of the literature to examine recent (2007-present), randomized controlled studies of the following psychotherapy interventions for bipolar disorder: psychoeducation (PE), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and family therapies such as family focused therapy (FFT).

Results

All of the psychotherapy interventions appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Psychoeducation and CBT are associated with increased time to mood episode relapse or recurrence. MBCT has demonstrated a particular effectiveness in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms. Online psychotherapy interventions, programs combining one or more psychotherapy interventions, and targeted interventions centering on particular symptoms have been the focus of recent, randomized controlled studies in bipolar disorder.

Conclusions

Psychotherapy interventions for the treatment of bipolar disorder have substantial evidence for efficacy. The next challenge will to disseminate these psychotherapies into the community.

### Applications of time-series analysis to mood fluctuations in bipolar disorder to promote treatment innovation: a case series [^116UW61z]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Here we investigate the use of a daily mood-monitoring time-series approach in a single case series study of a novel treatment for bipolar disorder. Single case series designs are important research tools in the development of new treatments, providing an alternative to cohort and case–control designs. They require smaller sample sizes compared with randomized control trials, as statistical power is provided by the within-subject comparison of treatment effects. Moreover, single case series allow for further refinement of treatment protocols at an exploratory stage, when investment of time and resources required by randomized control trials would be premature. They also allow us to examine individual patient level data — our clinical goal.

The broader clinical picture informing our choice of treatment innovation concerns the high rates of anxiety that complicate bipolar disorder, flagged by clinical guidelines as an unmet need requiring treatment innovation. Anxiety symptoms are associated with worse prognostic factors such as rapid mood cycles, higher illness severity, less euthymic days and increased suicidality, poorer functioning and worse treatment response. Unfortunately, pharmacological treatment for anxiety within bipolar disorder has not been investigated formally and antidepressants may even destabilize mood, for example, inducing a 'manic switch'. Psychological treatments such as cognitive therapy offer adjunctive approaches for addressing anxiety in bipolar disorder, but, like the use of antidepressants, often represent extrapolation from uncomplicated anxiety disorders.

Anxiety in bipolar disorder should be of particular interest if, as we have proposed, it contributes to depressed mood instability via an 'emotional amplifier' effect of anxiety-laden mental imagery.

Mental imagery occurs when 'perceptual information is accessed from memory, giving rise to the experience of 'seeing with the mind's eye', 'hearing with the mind's ear' and so on'. Recent findings suggest that imagery can have an important role in the development and maintenance of various mental disorders, including anxiety disorders. Traditional clinical assessments can neglect asking patients about their intrusive upsetting mental images, such as intrusive images of dreaded future events or negative memories, images which can fuel anxiety and low mood. A psychological treatment targeting such maladaptive imagery could therefore improve anxiety and mood instability. Here we test one such protocol (MAPP; Mood Action Psychology Programme: clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01981018), which is an imagery-focused cognitive therapy.

### Toward the future of psychiatric diagnosis: the seven pillars of RDoC [^112Tr8r4]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

A diagnostic system can have many purposes. For instance, a major reason for the creation of the ICD was to establish a comprehensive manual for determining causes of mortality, thus enhancing efforts at improving public health. However, perhaps the pre-eminent role of diagnosis in medicine is to determine the exact nature of a patient's disease in order to administer the optimal treatment. Yet, very little discussion of this aspect can be found either in published papers or in the extensive 'blogosphere' that has sprung up around the DSM-5. The revisions have renewed debates about the definition and nature of mental disorders; the various positions in the philosophy of science that might represent how to think about mental illness ('realist', 'essentialist', and so on); categorical versus dimensional approaches to disorders; and the role of reductionism and phenomenology. Any discussion about the ramifications of these various considerations in actually making a difference on how we treat our patients, however, has been conspicuously lacking.

This lack is likely due in no small part to the current nature of treatments for mental disorders. On the one hand, effective treatments exist. Treatments for major classes of disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are available, and effective for large numbers of patients. Further, a number of effective treatment modalities - pharmaceutical interventions, psychosocial or behavioral treatments, medical devices - have been established. On the other hand, treatments are not particularly precise, and tend to affect broad classes of disorders. Anti-depressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are used to treat not only depression but a wide variety of anxiety, mood and other disorders. Anti-psychotic agents are used not only with schizophrenia but in bipolar disorder and sometimes for personality and other severe disorders. Anxiolytics such as valium are prescribed widely across the anxiety and mood spectrum. A similar situation prevails for behavioral treatments; for instance, the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy, albeit with many variants, has expanded beyond the internalizing disorders spectrum for which it was originally developed to the treatment of virtually all mental disorders (for example, see).

5.5.4 Step 4: add on or switch therapy (second‐line agents)

Second‐line

Although olanzapine (level 1) 381, 382 is effective in preventing any mood, manic or depressive episode, it is considered second‐line treatment because of safety issues such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long‐acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) 383 or adjunctive therapy (level 2) 384 has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode, but had no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention in these trials. Further, there was a trend for superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at 6 months in preventing any mood episode and in preventing mania but not depression. 367 Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been assessed in any large placebo‐controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. 385 Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode but less effective than olanzapine. 386

Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) 387 has been shown to be effective in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting (positive and negative) data for acute treatment (see Sections 3 and 4). There was a trend for superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing any mood episode (but not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. 388 Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for those who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

5.5.5 Step 5: add on or switch therapy (third‐line agents)

Third‐line

Third‐line agents are listed alphabetically in Table 18. There was a trend for superiority of adjunctive aripiprazole with lamotrigine (level 2) 389 compared to lamotrigine monotherapy in preventing mania; thus, this combination may provide additional prophylaxis for patients on lamotrigine monotherapy in preventing manic relapses. Clozapine (level 4) 162 and gabapentin (level 4) 390 may also be useful adjunctive treatments for those who incompletely respond to first‐ or second‐line therapies. The olanzapine/fluoxetine combination appears to maintain mood stability over a 6‐month period in patients with bipolar depression who respond acutely to this combination (level 2). 391

### Topiramate for acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder in adults [^116BSiLj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a common recurrent illness with high levels of chronicity. Previous trials have suggested that the anticonvulsant topiramate may be efficacious in bipolar disorder. This is an update of a previous Cochrane review (last published 2006) on the role of topiramate in bipolar disorder.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topiramate for acute mood episodes in bipolar disorder in adults compared to placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, and combination pharmacological treatment as measured by treatment of symptoms on specific rating scales for individual episodes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register to 13 October 2015, which includes records from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) all years; MEDLINE 1950-; EMBASE 1974-; and PsycINFO 1967-. We performed handsearching, reviewing of grey literature and reference lists, and correspondence with authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing topiramate with placebo or with active agents in the treatment of acute mood episodes in adult male and female patients with bipolar disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed data extraction and methodological quality assessment. For analysis, we used odds ratio (OR) for binary efficacy outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuously distributed outcomes.

Main Results

This review included six studies with a total of 1638 male and female participants, of all ethnic backgrounds in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In five studies, participants were experiencing a manic or mixed episode, and in the other study the participants met the criteria for a depressive phase. Topiramate was compared with placebo and alternative pharmacological treatment as both monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment. Moderate-quality evidence showed topiramate to be no more or less efficacious than placebo as monotherapy, in terms of mean change on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (range 0 to 60), at endpoint 3 weeks (MD 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 2.86; participants = 664; studies = 3; P = 0.17) and at endpoint 12 weeks (MD -0.58, 95% CI -3.45 to 2.29; participants = 212; studies = 1; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). For the same outcome, low-quality evidence also showed topiramate to be no more or less efficacious than placebo as add-on therapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (MD -0.14, 95% CI -2.10 to 1.82; participants = 287; studies = 1; P = 0.89) in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes. We found high-quality evidence that lithium was more efficacious than topiramate as monotherapy in the treatment of manic and mixed episodes in terms of mean change on YMRS (range 0 to 60) (endpoint 12 weeks) (MD 8.46, 95% CI 5.86 to 11.06; participants = 449; studies = 2; P < 0.00001). For troublesome side effects experienced of any nature, we found no difference between topiramate and placebo as monotherapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.40; participants = 212; studies = 1; P = 0.30; low-quality evidence) or as add-on therapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.10; participants = 287; studies = 1; P = 0.76; low-quality evidence). In terms of participants experiencing side effects of any nature, we found no difference between topiramate and an alternative drug as monotherapy (endpoint 12 weeks) (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.52; participants = 230; studies = 1; P = 0.63; low-quality evidence) or as add-on therapy (endpoint 8 weeks) (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.90; participants = 36; studies = 1; P = 0.50; very low-quality evidence). We considered five of the studies to be at low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases, and at unclear risk for allocation concealment and other potential sources of bias. We considered the McIntyre 2000 study to be at high risk of performance bias; unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and other potential sources of bias; and at low risk for attrition bias and reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the use of topiramate in clinical practice from this evidence. The only high-quality evidence found was that lithium is more efficacious than topiramate when used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder, and we note that this evidence came from only two studies. Moderate-quality evidence showed that topiramate was no more or less efficacious than placebo as monotherapy when a 3-week endpoint was used, but the quality of the evidence for this outcome at a 12-week endpoint dropped to low. As we graded the quality of the evidence for the other findings as low and very low, it was not possible to draw any conclusions from the results. To best address this research question, if investigators see the indication in so doing, more double-blind randomised controlled trials could be conducted that are more explicit with regard to methodological issues. In particular, investigators could compare placebo, alternative, and combination treatments (including a wide range of mood stabilisers), atypical antipsychotics for manic and mixed episodes, and antidepressants in combination with mood stabilisers or atypical antipsychotics for depressive episodes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1131yMpR]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — digital and web-based interventions for bipolar disorder: One randomized controlled trial using a 70-hour web-based cognitive remediation program in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) with psychosis showed improvement in cognition but not community function compared with routine care, with high dropout in both groups (approximately 50%), and findings were recommended to be considered preliminary. In individuals with BD 1 and BD 2, two web-based programs (Mood Swings and Mood Swings Plus) noted decreased mood symptoms but had no control arm and high attrition across groups (approximately 80%), limiting conclusions. Additional web-delivered mindfulness apps found no difference in anxiety symptoms in an internationally recruited BD population, and an Australian study comparing a web-based psychoeducational and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program with TAU also showed no difference. No evidence to indicate any level of harm associated with computer- or web-based applications was found.

### Anxiety symptoms and syndromes in bipolar children and adolescents [^115AnYDq]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are relatively common in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Research to date indicates they may impact the onset, course, and treatment response of bipolar illness in children. Anxiety disorders often precede the onset of pediatric bipolar disorder. Family studies suggest first-degree relatives of bipolar patients are at increased risk for developing mood and anxiety disorders compared with relatives of individuals without mood disorders. Childhood adversity has been associated with higher rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and more severe illness course in bipolar patients. Preliminary study of the neurobiology of bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorders suggests it may be neurophysiologically distinct from bipolar disorder without comorbid anxiety. Bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorders has been associated with greater functional impairment and slower recovery. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to help us better understand the relationship between bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders so that opportunities for early intervention and effective treatment can be realized.

### Acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar mania: the role of atypical antipsychotics [^1114vDRb]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex condition including depression, mania, and in many cases associated with comorbid anxiety symptoms and substance abuse. Mood stabilizers including lithium and divalproex have been considered standard therapy for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder, but remission rates remain inadequate. Conventional antipsychotics have demonstrated efficacy for acute mania, but they appear to have little role in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Despite substantial evidence of efficacy and recent guideline recommendations, atypical antipsychotics remain underused for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Data from double-blind, controlled trials are available for a number of clinically meaningful efficacy measures, including improvement in manic symptoms, onset of action, response rates, remission rates, improvement in comorbid depressive symptoms, and induction/worsening of mania or depression. Atypical antipsychotics are effective both as alternatives to lithium or divalproex as monotherapy, or in combination with these mood stabilizers, in the acute and likely the maintenance treatment of mania. The atypical antipsychotics represent an effective and relatively safe addition to our armamentarium for the treatment of bipolar disorder.

9 APPROACHES TO ANXIETY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMORBIDITIES

Medical and psychiatric comorbidities are extremely common in patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, as a general strategy, we would recommend treatments for bipolar disorder that minimize the emergence of new comorbidities such as weight gain or the metabolic syndrome and actively treat psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety disorders. While not optimal for anxiety and substance abuse comorbidity, lithium helps prevent episode sensitization by inhibiting the recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes, protects against the progression of cognitive dysfunction and may slow or prevent cortical volume decrements. Comorbid anxiety disorders, which convey a poor prognosis, appear best treated with mood stabilizing anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine) as well as atypical antipsychotics, rather than antidepressants which have a low rate of effectiveness in patients with bipolar disorder, and an even lower rate in those with anxiety disorders. Lamotrigine appears more effective in those with a personal or family history of anxiety disorders, reported a trend for superior effectiveness of carbamazepine compared to lithium in those with BP II and anxiety and substance abuse comorbidities. Marked antianxiety effects were reported for valproate in the treatment of bipolar depression. Gabapentin, which does not have antimanic effectiveness, may nonetheless help treat a variety of anxiety syndromes, including panic and social phobia, as well as help with alcohol avoidance at doses of 900 to 1200 mg/day. Likewise, topiramate possesses no anti‐manic efficacy, but can help multiple comorbidities including alcohol and cocaine addiction, bulimia, and anger attacks. Use of off‐label agents to address anxiety and related comorbidities is thus to be encouraged rather than avoided, and as a consequence leaving the patient inadequately treated.

### Relapse prevention in bipolar disorder: a critical review of current guidelines [^114n4XPE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is an important and serious mental illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, unfortunately, the evidence base regarding treatment is less than satisfactory. In such circumstances clinicians often resort to reputable sets of guidelines. A number of these currently exist; in the United Kingdom the most prominent being that produced by the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP). This paper reviews the methodology of this guideline and its recommendations regarding the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder and compares this with guidelines produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithms (TIMA) for bipolar I disorder. It is concluded that the BAP guidelines continue to be a reasonable set of recommendations, though there are new data available since their publication. All the guidelines reviewed place lithium and valproate at the top of the list of options for long-term treatment. There is a trend to increasingly recognize atypical antipsychotics, particularly olanzapine, as an additional alternative and an increasing prominence of lamotrigine for prevention of depressive relapses. All other treatment options currently have an extremely limited evidence base and do not feature consistently in the published guidelines.

### Lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Lnvo5]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are increasingly recognised as an important determinant of outcomes in patients with bipolar disorder. However, a reliable estimate of their prevalence is still missing, because the published prevalence of anxiety disorders in individuals with bipolar disorder varies widely. In this study, we aimed to quantify the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in individuals with bipolar disorder and compare it with rates in people without the disorder.

Methods

We searched the Web of Knowledge and Medline (through the PubMed interface) for articles published in any language from the database inception dates up until June 1, 2014, using a combination of the word "bipolar" and search terms for anxiety disorders. We included studies that reported original data about the lifetime prevalence of DSM-III and DSM-IV anxiety disorders in adults with bipolar disorder that recruited participants irrespective of comorbidities and that used a validated diagnostic interview to establish the diagnoses of bipolar disorder and at least one anxiety disorder. We excluded studies that reported only the current prevalence or if we were unable to establish whether they described current or lifetime prevalence, and those with discrepancies in the data that could not be resolved by contacting the authors. We did a random-effects meta-analysis of lifetime prevalence of DSM-III and DSM-IV anxiety disorders in adults with bipolar disorder, in which we quantified the lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder in people with bipolar disorder. We compared this prevalence in people with bipolar I disorder versus those with bipolar II disorder, and in people with bipolar disorder versus population controls.

Findings

Data from 40 studies, including 14 914 individuals from North America, Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia, indicate that the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in individuals with bipolar disorder is 45% (95% CI 40–51). Direct comparison in five samples with a total of 1378 individuals with bipolar disorder and 56 812 population controls without bipolar disorder indicates a three-fold increase (risk ratio [RR] 3·22 [95% CI 2·41–4·29]; p < 0·0001) in the prevalence of anxiety disorders in those with bipolar disorder. 13 studies that included both individuals with bipolar I disorder (n = 4270) and those with bipolar II disorder (n = 1939) showed no difference in the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders between these subtypes (RR 1·07 [95% CI 0·96–1·20]; p = 0·223). We noted significant heterogeneity among included studies that was not accounted for by reported differences in study characteristics.

Interpretation

People with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of anxiety disorders compared with those without bipolar disorder; nearly one in two has an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders should therefore be assessed alongside the mood symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.
