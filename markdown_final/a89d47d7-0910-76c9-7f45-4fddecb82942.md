## Question

How to diagnose menieres

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose Ménière's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and whether MD is a clinical diagnosis. Then, I should verify the core clinical criteria for definite versus probable MD. Next, I will review the key differentials, especially vestibular migraine, and how to separate them. After that, I need to check which diagnostic tests are recommended versus discouraged. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, documentation needs, and follow-up to refine the diagnosis over time, and I will anchor this to the 2020 AAO-HNS guideline and related high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: Ménière's disease remains a clinical diagnosis based on symptom history plus audiometry, with no single definitive test, so I should not overinterpret ancillary tests that are not required for classification. The 2020 AAO-HNS guideline explicitly states clinicians should diagnose definite or probable MD when patients have two or more episodes of vertigo with the defined durations plus fluctuating aural symptoms, after excluding other causes, and it emphasizes that audiometry is necessary to distinguish definite from probable disease [^f863ee63] [^915e4ca9] [^775d8578].

> I will now examine the core clinical criteria for definite MD: at least two spontaneous vertigo attacks, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, with audiometrically documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least one occasion, and fluctuating aural symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in that ear. Importantly, symptoms must not be better accounted for by another disorder, and the hearing loss should be asymmetric by more than 15 dB PTA or a word recognition difference greater than 15% between ears to meet typical asymmetry thresholds used in MD workups [^f9b4a067] [^4410d866] [^66dfb329].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration. I should confirm the criteria for probable MD: at least two episodes of vertigo or dizziness lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours, with fluctuating aural symptoms in the affected ear, and other causes excluded. Probable MD does not require documented audiometric hearing loss, which is why it is a broader category that may evolve with further testing or longitudinal follow-up [^e5443388] [^66dfb329].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and the most common mimicker, vestibular migraine. VM typically presents with vestibular symptoms lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours, often with migraine features or a migraine history, and can include cochlear symptoms, which makes it easy to confuse with MD. The AAO-HNS guideline recommends explicitly assessing for VM when evaluating suspected MD, and I need to ensure I document migraine features, attack durations, and the pattern of hearing loss to avoid misclassification [^d8ecc6a1] [^9c0f4b12] [^1189788e].

> Wait, let me verify the role of audiometry because this is pivotal. Audiometry is mandatory to move from probable to definite MD, and it should include pure-tone thresholds, bone conduction to exclude conductive components, tympanometry and acoustic reflexes, and word recognition scores. Asymmetric SNHL by PTA greater than 15 dB or a WRS difference greater than 15% supports MD, whereas normal hearing or conductive patterns should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis or search for alternative etiologies such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence or retrocochlear pathology [^775d8578] [^4410d866].

> I need to check which ancillary tests are discouraged routinely. The AAO-HNS advises against routine vestibular function testing and against routine electrocochleography to establish the diagnosis of MD, because diagnostic yield is variable and results are not specific enough to replace clinical criteria. ECochG sensitivity ranges widely and elevated SP/AP ratios can occur in other conditions, so I should avoid over-ordering these tests unless there is a specific research or equivocal-case rationale [^9549c2f9] [^fb4a3a65] [^925d76a6].

> But wait, what if the hearing loss is asymmetric or there are red flags? In that case, I should consider MRI of the internal auditory canal and posterior fossa to exclude retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma, especially with audiometrically verified asymmetric SNHL. Routine MRI is not required for all patients, but it is reasonable when asymmetry or atypical features raise concern for alternate diagnoses [^cda27797] [^4410d866].

> Let me consider emerging tools cautiously. Delayed post-gadolinium high-resolution MRI can visualize endolymphatic hydrops and may support the diagnosis in equivocal cases, but it is not yet required by standard criteria and can be positive in other vestibular disorders, so I should not rely on MRI evidence of hydrops alone to make the diagnosis. Nonetheless, a recent meta-analysis suggests MRI descriptors can have high specificity, which may help in select scenarios or research settings [^8fe8095d] [^a2af7bdb].

> I should double-check the role of vestibular testing if I need to differentiate MD from VM. Caloric testing may show unilateral weakness in a substantial fraction of MD patients, but this is not diagnostic and is not required for MD classification. Similarly, vHIT and VEMPs may show abnormalities but lack sufficient specificity to distinguish MD from VM reliably, so I should interpret any abnormal vestibular test in clinical context and avoid overattributing diagnostic weight to them [^925d76a6] [^2e200b46] [^7f86a30d].

> Next, I should review documentation and longitudinal follow-up because MD often declares itself over time. I need to record attack frequency, duration, associated aural symptoms, and functional impact, and I should repeat audiometry periodically to capture fluctuating or progressive hearing loss that may convert a probable diagnosis to definite. The guideline also recommends documenting vertigo control, hearing status, and quality of life at follow-up to guide therapy adjustments [^fe9c9863] [^fc7c1af5] [^9d035fb2].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. Early disease may present with isolated cochlear or vestibular symptoms before the full triad emerges, and some patients ultimately develop bilateral disease, so I should maintain diagnostic humility and reassess over time. If a patient initially labeled probable MD later shows characteristic low- to mid-frequency SNHL, I can reclassify to definite MD, and if the clinical course diverges, I should reconsider alternative diagnoses such as autoimmune inner ear disease or perilymphatic fistula [^710e6a9a] [^b73d401c] [^c85216bc].

> Let me reconsider the practical diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm episodic vertigo with the correct durations, screen for VM and other mimics, obtain audiometry with attention to asymmetry and speech scores, and reserve MRI for asymmetric SNHL or atypical features. Avoid routine vestibular testing and ECochG unless there is a specific indication, and plan longitudinal follow-up to capture disease evolution and refine classification over time [^ba554b24] [^775d8578] [^9549c2f9].

> In summary, I need to ensure my diagnosis remains anchored to clinical criteria plus audiometry, with deliberate exclusion of alternatives, especially VM, and with judicious use of imaging or ancillary tests only when indicated. This approach minimizes misdiagnosis, avoids unnecessary interventions, and aligns with contemporary guideline-based care for Ménière's disease [^f863ee63] [^915e4ca9] [^d8ecc6a1].

Diagnose Ménière's disease using a **clinical approach** based on the 2020 AAO-HNS guidelines [^f863ee63], which require **two or more spontaneous vertigo attacks** (20 minutes to 12 hours) [^f9b4a067] with documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss [^775d8578] and fluctuating aural symptoms (tinnitus, fullness, or fluctuating hearing) in the affected ear, after excluding other causes [^915e4ca9]. Probable Ménière's disease is diagnosed when vertigo lasts 20 minutes to 24 hours without confirmed hearing loss [^e5443388]. Audiometry is essential to document hearing loss and distinguish definite from probable disease [^775d8578]; routine vestibular testing or electrocochleography is not recommended for initial diagnosis [^9549c2f9] [^fb4a3a65]. MRI is considered only when asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss or atypical features suggest retrocochlear pathology [^cda27797]. Differentiate from vestibular migraine [^d8ecc6a1] and other vestibular disorders using history, audiometry, and clinical judgment [^c85216bc].

## Clinical diagnostic criteria

The **AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines** provide standardized criteria for diagnosing Ménière's disease:

| **Category** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Definite Ménière's disease | - Two or more spontaneous vertigo attacks, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours [^f9b4a067] <br/> - Audiometrically documented fluctuating low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least one occasion [^775d8578] <br/> - Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear [^915e4ca9] <br/> - Symptoms not better accounted for by another disorder [^f863ee63] |
| Probable Ménière's disease | - Two or more episodes of vertigo or dizziness, each lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours [^e5443388] <br/> - Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear [^66dfb329] <br/> - Symptoms not better accounted for by another disorder [^f863ee63] |

---

## Essential diagnostic steps

### Detailed clinical history

Obtain a **careful history** to characterize vertigo attacks (duration, frequency, triggers) and associated aural symptoms (tinnitus, fullness, fluctuating hearing) [^af805ba7]. Exclude other causes such as vestibular migraine, BPPV, labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, and central vestibular disorders [^c85216bc].

---

### Audiometric evaluation

Perform **pure-tone audiometry** to document low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and assess symmetry and fluctuation [^775d8578]. Include speech recognition testing to evaluate word recognition scores and detect retrocochlear pathology [^4410d866].

---

### Exclusion of other disorders

Differentiate Ménière's disease from **vestibular migraine**, which presents with similar symptoms but typically lacks the characteristic audiometric findings of Ménière's disease [^d8ecc6a1]. Consider other vestibular disorders such as BPPV, labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, and central vestibular disorders [^c85216bc].

---

## Ancillary tests (not routinely required)

### Vestibular function testing

Routine vestibular testing (calorics, VEMPs, vHIT) is **not recommended** for initial diagnosis because of limited diagnostic yield and variability [^9549c2f9] [^925d76a6]. These tests may be considered in atypical cases or when differentiating from other vestibular disorders [^2e200b46].

---

### Electrocochleography (ECoG)

Routine ECoG is **not recommended** for initial diagnosis due to limited sensitivity and specificity [^fb4a3a65] [^925d76a6]. It may be considered in select cases where additional supportive evidence is needed [^cdd778d5].

---

### Imaging

MRI of the internal auditory canal and posterior fossa is **not routinely required** but should be considered in patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss or atypical clinical features to exclude retrocochlear pathology (e.g. vestibular schwannoma) [^cda27797] [^4410d866].

---

## Differentiation from vestibular migraine

Vestibular migraine is a **common mimic** of Ménière's disease. Key differences include:

| **Feature** | **Ménière's disease** | **Vestibular migraine** |
|-|-|-|
| Vertigo duration | 20 minutes to 12 hours | 5 minutes to 72 hours |
| Hearing loss | Documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss | Rare or mild |
| Migraine features | Absent | Present (headache, photophobia, phonophobia) |
| Audiometry | Abnormal | Normal or mild abnormality |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and adjust management strategies [^fe9c9863]. Document vertigo control, hearing status, and quality of life at each visit [^fc7c1af5].

---

Diagnosing Ménière's disease relies on a **clinical approach** grounded in the 2020 AAO-HNS guidelines, requiring two or more vertigo attacks with documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms, after excluding other causes [^f863ee63]. Audiometry is essential; routine vestibular testing or ECoG is not recommended for initial diagnosis [^9549c2f9] [^fb4a3a65]. MRI is reserved for atypical cases or asymmetric hearing loss [^cda27797].

Ménière's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes attacks of vertigo and hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness in the involved ear. Over the past 4 decades, the Equilibrium Committee of the AAO-HNS has issued guidelines for diagnostic criteria, with the latest version being published in 1995. These criteria were reviewed in 2015 by the Equilibrium Committee, and revisions were approved at the recent meeting of the committee at the 2015 AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting. The following commentary outlines the amended and approved criteria.

### Utility of area curve ratio electrocochleography in early meniere disease (...) [^cdd778d5]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

A retrospective chart review of a 3-year period was conducted. All charts of patients diagnosed as having MD who had undergone tympanic ECochG were examined to identify those with possible MD. Exclusion criteria were incomplete workup, ECochG performed using a prior system, cochlear microphonic spike obscuring ratio measurements, and prior otologic surgery. A control group of patients with normal SP/AP ratios and ECochG data were identified. SP/AP amplitude and area curve ratios for both groups were measured. MENIERE DISEASE is an affliction that poses a diagnostic dilemma. Since its description by Prosper Ménière in 1861, the wide spectrum of disease presentation continues to challenge clinicians in making the diagnosis. Objective diagnostic tests including electrocochleography have been widely studied. The use of ECochG in supporting the diagnosis of MD has become standard testing for many physicians.

Margolis et al2 found that ECochG can be a sensitive test in the early stages of MD, and that the specificity approached 95%. However, the sensitivity of the test ranges from 20%2 to 70%. 1 Some explanations for the variation in sensitivity include patient hearing levels, method of stimulation, cutoff for positive interpretation, ECochG characteristic measured, and location of electrode; in general, a sensitivity around 60% is a consistent expectation. 1, 8-13. This group of patients is uniquely poised to benefit from any method to increase sensitivity in confirmatory testing. We advocate initiation of medical therapy for MD based on the clinical presentation consistent with possible MD, exclusion of other pathological conditions, and confirmation with area curve ratio when the SP/AP ratio is negative.

In cases where the clinical suspicion is high for possible MD, ECochG is negative, and the patient can tolerate medical therapy, we advocate initiating medical therapy immediately to see if patients will respond. The SP/AP area curve ratio significantly improves ECochG diagnostic sensitivity in possible MD. This refinement of ECochG analysis can allow diagnosis of MD at an earlier stage of disease and hasten intervention to prevent inner ear deterioration. We recommend the use of ECochG with SP/AP area curve analysis in examining individuals who portray clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of this disorder.

### Ménière's disease: new guidelines, subtypes, imaging, and more [^4d8063ea]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews recent developments in Ménière's disease including etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic investigations that have changed the landscape for medical providers. These updates shed light onto the complex nature of Ménière's disease and generate additional means to provide optimal care to patients.

Recent Findings

Given the multifactorial cause of Ménière's disease, five subtypes of Ménière's disease have recently been proposed. A knowledge of these subtypes will aid in the development of an appropriate treatment algorithm. Although newer treatments have not been developed, stepwise treatment algorithms have been proposed and can improve patient care. New MRI modalities and serum testing hold promise as clinical clues and biomarkers.

Summary

As these updated diagnostic criteria are used, Ménière's disease can be identified and treated more precisely. This will in turn allow for future randomized controlled studies to improve the quality of treatment options available. Future imaging, vestibular testing, and the potential for serum biomarkers may illuminate additional diagnostic criteria, only furthering the improvement in clinical care.

### Diagnostic criteria for menière's disease [^b66ba82b]. Journal of Vestibular Research (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ICVD criteria for Ménière's disease" for Ménière's disease and dizziness and vertigo.

The International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD) criteria for Ménière's disease is a diagnostic tool designed to accurately identify and classify cases of Ménière's disease. This clinical tool is particularly useful in distinguishing Ménière's disease from other vestibular disorders, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The ICVD criteria for Ménière's disease primarily consists of four components: episodes duration, aural symptoms, audiometry findings, and differential diagnosis. The episodes duration component requires either two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, or two or more episodes of vertigo or dizziness each lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours. The aural symptoms component necessitates the presence of fluctuating aural symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in the affected ear. The audiometry findings component requires audiometrically documented low-to-medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least one occasion before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. Lastly, the differential diagnosis component ensures that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis.

The ICVD criteria for Ménière's disease provides a classification of "definite" or "probable" Ménière's disease. A diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease is made if the patient meets criteria A, C, D, and E. A diagnosis of probable Ménière's disease is made if the patient meets criteria B, C, and E. If the patient does not meet these criteria, then a diagnosis of Ménière's disease is not made according to the ICVD criteria.

The tool designed for assessing Ménière's disease criteria evaluates specific clinical inputs to determine if a person meets either the definite or probable criteria for the condition. Here's how the evaluation process unfolds:

The user needs to provide responses to four sets of criteria:

- **Episodes Duration**: This consists of two options, where a user selects whether they have experienced:
- At least 2 spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting from 20 minutes to 12 hours.
- At least 2 episodes of vertigo or dizziness, each lasting from 20 minutes to 24 hours.

- **Aural Symptoms**: The user confirms the presence of fluctuating aural symptoms, such as changes in hearing, tinnitus, or ear fullness, in the affected ear.

- **Audiometry Findings**: The user verifies audiometric documentation showing low-to-medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in one ear. This loss should be recorded at least once before, during, or after a vertigo episode.

- **Differential Diagnosis**: The user ensures that the symptoms are not better explained by another vestibular diagnosis.

The tool processes these inputs with a decision-making strategy:

- If a user reports having at least 2 spontaneous vertigo episodes with specific durations (20 minutes to 12 hours), confirms fluctuating aural symptoms, presents with audiometrically documented hearing loss, and rules out other vestibular diagnoses, their case is classified as "Meets criteria for definite MD."

- If a user indicates a broader timeframe for vertigo or dizziness episodes (20 minutes to 24 hours), confirms fluctuating aural symptoms, and rules out other vestibular issues with no additional auditory conditions, their case is delineated as "Meets criteria for probable MD."

- If neither of these condition sets are met, then the result is "Criteria not met."

This approach integrates user responses with established Ménière's disease diagnostic criteria, using logical assessments to align symptoms with either a definite or probable diagnosis classification.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease executive summary [^a6d4f8f5]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many, and approaches typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Clinical hints and precipitating factors in patients suffering from meniere's disease [^8d4f5e44]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Meniere disease is one of the most fascinating and most vexing of all clinical conditions encountered by the otolaryngologist. Operationally speaking, a Meniere ear is a fragile ear. In fact, Meniere disease can and should be redefined as a degenerating inner ear that has impairment of one or more homeostatic systems, resulting in instability of hearing and balance function. This updated definition is a valuable guide to the clinical epidemiology and presentation of Meniere disease and to understanding the effects of conservative treatments. In the absence of a definitive test for Meniere disease, the greatest challenge for the clinician may be differentiating this condition from migraine. Ultimately, Meniere vertigo attacks are controllable in more than 99% of cases, but hearing loss and other auditory symptoms tend to be unresponsive to treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^467f8ddd]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Clinical subtyping of Ménière's disease [^03bae10f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Fundamentally, Ménière's disease is a constellation of symptoms and, as such, may represent the final common pathway for a number of disease processes, as opposed to being the consequence of a single isolated pathology. Within this type of consideration, much can be learned regarding the etiology, presentation, prognosis, and treatment of these individual conditions by applying subtyping techniques currently employed to better understand similar disease processes that are encountered in other allied fields of medicine. This commentary proposes the principles, required processes, and benefits of subtyping for Ménière's disease.

### Survey of Ménière's disease in a subspecialty referral practice [^0e8330f4]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define the prevalence of definite Ménière's disease (MD) among patients presenting with characteristic symptoms and examine the utility of published diagnostic guidelines.

Study Design and Setting

Retrospective review in an academic referral practice.

Results

The prevalence of definite MD in these 295 individuals was 64%. The next-largest group (23%) consisted of patients with only cochlear symptoms. Those initially classified as probable are usually reclassified as definite with extended follow-up. Of those with definite MD, the mean duration of disease at last follow-up was 7.6 years, 56% were female, 19% had bilateral disease, and 34% required surgical management for vertigo.

Conclusions

The 1995 AAO-HNS guidelines are useful for classification of MD according to certainty of diagnosis and severity of disease, though some modifications could be considered.

Significance

Application of consistent diagnostic criteria is essential for epidemiological, genetic, or outcomes studies of Ménière's disease.

### What is menière's disease? A contemporary re-evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops [^7fe2a9a1]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria: evolution of the current criteria for assessment of Menière’s disease

Symptom-based classification methods have been used to make the diagnosis. In the diagnostic work up, mainly vertigo character and type, associated hearing loss and tinnitus or aural fullness are taken into consideration. Indeed, in a taxonomic investigation of patients with vertigo, after exclusion of neurological and middle ear conditions, head trauma and ototoxicity, Hinchcliffe found that those with ‘classical’ Menière’s disease (meeting the ‘‘definite MD’ definition below) fell in a single nosological entity with all the other cases of vertigo. He later argued that MD included ‘formes frustes’, where the triad of symptoms is not complete. Diagnostically confirmed cases represent only a limited proportion of individuals with the disease, as reflected in the variability between prevalence studies.

The nomenclature of “cochlear” or “vestibular” MD was coined by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) in 1972 and was abandoned with the 1985 and 1995 updates of the AAO-HNS criteria as there was insufficient evidence that these mono-symptomatic diseases share the same pathophysiology with MD. The revised AAO-HNS criteria define ‘Possible MD’ as episodic vertigo or fluctuating hearing loss. ‘Probable MD’ consists of one attack of rotatory vertigo lasting at least 20 min together with tinnitus and documented hearing loss. ‘Definite MD’ consists of two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo 20 min or longer with tinnitus and documented hearing loss. ‘Certain MD’ is diagnosed by additional histological verification of EH in the inner ear. To define the condition clinically, the existing AAO-HNS classification is often unhelpful as the latency of joint presentation of the cardinal complaints may take up to 10 years. General practitioners, otolaryngologists and audio-vestibular physicians face a challenge in making the diagnosis of MD. The symptoms can be variable, occur over different time spans and the hearing loss can recover before audiometric measurements are made.

Ménière's disease—standardization of definitions, severity, treatment failure, and outcomes is needed: The page states there is no clear definition or standardization of stages, severity, and response to treatment universally accepted for MD and proposes staging categories (“Active,” “Chronic,” and “Burned out”) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe), along with definitions for failure of conservative and medical management. It also calls for development and validation of clinically relevant measures of quality of life (QOL), standardization of disease-specific QOL measures, and standardized follow-up focused on symptoms and long-term hearing and balance outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^d0e3fab5]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière’s disease—implementation considerations and practice support address barriers and tools for adoption: Anticipated barriers to applying the recommendations in the guideline include (1) lack of knowledge penetration of current diagnostic criteria for MD, VM, and other vestibular disorders; (2) difficulty of changing entrenched clinician practice patterns, including use of diagnostic testing (eg, overuse of vestibular testing) and in non–evidence-based management strategies; (3) variability in access and quality of diagnostic tests (ie, audiograms, MRI), treatment options (eg, betahistine, IT therapy, surgery, vestibular therapy) based on setting of care, geographic location, and the training of the treating clinician; and (4) time restrictions and heavy clinical workloads (eg, precluding thorough patient education). The first 2 may be addressed with educational materials, active learning from experts and opinion leaders, and continuing medical education events. Short of overarching health care reform, the last 2 barriers may require approaches specific to local contexts, including multiprofessional collaboration, altered clinical workflows, and financial incentives. Supporting materials have been developed to assist in guideline implementation, and an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment has been developed to provide decision support to clinicians choosing among different diagnostic pathways and treatment options; the algorithm allows for more rapid understanding of the guideline’s logic and the sequence of the action statements, and the GDG hopes that the algorithm can be adopted as a quick-reference guide to support the implementation of the guideline’s recommendations. As patient education and shared decision making are essential components in the appropriate management of MD, an outline of essential components of clinician-provided patient education has been developed; adherence to diet and lifestyle modifications can be particularly challenging for patients to navigate, and pertinent educational materials will be developed in conjunction with the GDG’s patient advocate; additionally, a resource list for patients and their families has been developed to assist them in identifying reliable sources of information and support groups. Per AAO-HNSF policy, the guideline will be reviewed and updated 5 years from the time of publication.

### Meniere's disease [^427ef5d3]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ménière's disease: 
- Definition: Ménière's disease is a chronic disorder of the inner ear characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of Ménière's disease is multifactorial, with a characteristic sign being endolymphatic hydrops, a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of Ménière's disease in the US is estimated at 190 per 100,000 population.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for Ménière's disease include adult age, family history, certain lifestyle and environmental factors, such as allergies.
- Disease course: Clinically, patients experience intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, along with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss that can progress over time. Tinnitus and aural pressure are also common symptoms. The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary greatly among patients.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of Ménière's disease is generally favorable in terms of symptom management.

### What is menière's disease? A contemporary re-evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops [^46facd85]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Menière's disease is a chronic condition with a prevalence of 200-500 per 100,000 and characterized by episodic attacks of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, aural pressure and a progressive loss of audiovestibular functions. Over 150 years ago, Prosper Menière was the first to recognize the inner ear as the site of lesion for this clinical syndrome. Over 75 years ago, endolymphatic hydrops was discovered as the pathologic correlate of Menière's disease. However, this pathologic finding could be ascertained only in post-mortem histologic studies. Due to this diagnostic dilemma and the variable manifestation of the various audiovestibular symptoms, diagnostic classification systems based on clinical findings have been repeatedly modified and have not been uniformly used in scientific publications on Menière's disease. Furthermore, the higher level measures of impact on quality of life such as vitality and social participation have been neglected hitherto. Recent developments of high-resolution MR imaging of the inner ear have now enabled us to visualize in vivo endolymphatic hydrops in patients with suspected Menière's disease. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge from temporal bone histologic studies and from the emerging evidence on imaging-based evaluation of patients with suspected Menière's disease. These indicate that endolymphatic hydrops is responsible not only for the full-blown clinical triad of simultaneous attacks of auditory and vestibular dysfunction, but also for other clinical presentations such as "vestibular" and "cochlear Menière's disease". As a consequence, we propose a new terminology which is based on symptomatic and imaging characteristics of these clinical entities to clarify and simplify their diagnostic classification.

Background

Description of the condition

Ménière's disease was first described by Prosper Ménière in 1861 as a condition characterised by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus (Baloh 2001). Sufferers may also report a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Typically, it initially affects one ear, although some individuals may progress to develop bilateral disease. A hallmark of the condition is that symptoms are intermittent ‐ occurring as discrete attacks that last from minutes to several hours, then resolve. However, over time there is usually a gradual deterioration in hearing, and there may be progressive loss of balance function, leading to chronic dizziness or vertigo.

The diagnosis of Ménière's disease is challenging, due to the episodic nature of the condition, clinical heterogeneity and the lack of a 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Even the agreed, international classification system has scope for two categories of diagnosis – 'definite' and 'probable' (Lopez‐Escamez 2015). In brief, a diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease requires at least two episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, together with audiometrically confirmed hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (reduction in hearing, tinnitus or fullness) in the affected ear. 'Probable' Ménière's disease includes similar features, but without the requirement for audiometry to diagnose hearing loss, and with scope for the vertigo episodes to last longer (up to 24 hours). Both categories ('definite' and 'probable') require that the symptoms are not more likely to be due to an alternative diagnosis, due to the recognised challenges in distinguishing between balance disorders.

Ménière’s disease (MD)—Statement 2: Assessing for vestibular migraine (VM)—Clinicians should determine if patients meet diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine when assessing for Ménière’s disease, a Recommendation with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Benefits include accuracy of diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary treatments or testing, more appropriate treatment, patient education, and promoting multidisciplinary care, while the risk/cost is extra time for assessment. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with Low confidence, and VM is a common cause of dizziness that can closely mimic MD; appropriate assessment could lead to more appropriate treatment. Supporting text notes VM patients are typically younger and more likely to be female than those with MD; a multidisciplinary panel has established diagnostic criteria for VM with migraine features in at least 50% of the vestibular episodes, and VM may present with short (<15 minutes) or prolonged (>24 hours) vertigo; conversely, MD should be diagnosed when characteristic audiometric hearing loss is identified on audiograms even when migraine features are present.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION The cranial nerves should be examined for signs of palsies, sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus is 80 percent sensitive for vestibular nuclear or cerebellar vermis lesions. 1, 3, 19 may be the most helpful test to perform on patients with vertigo. It has a positive predictive value of 83 percent and a negative predictive value of 52 percent for the diagnosis of BPPV. 7, 10 After the initial test, the intensity of induced symptoms typically wanes with repeated maneuvers in peripheral vertigo but does so less often in central vertigo. HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION The tympanic membranes should be examined for vesicles or cholesteatoma. Hennebert’s sign indicates the presence of a perilymphatic fistula.

Laboratory Evaluation Laboratory tests such as electrolytes, glucose, blood counts, and thyroid function tests identify the etiology of vertigo in fewer than 1 percent of patients with dizziness. 10 They may be appropriate when patients with vertigo exhibit signs or symptoms that suggest the presence of other causative conditions. Audiometry helps establish the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease.
20. 19 In one study, 24 40 percent of patients with dizziness and neurologic signs had relevant abnormalities suggesting central nervous system lesions on magnetic resonance imaging of the head. In patients with isolated vertigo who also were at risk for cerebrovascular disease, 25 percent had caudal cerebellar infarcts. 25 In general, magnetic resonance imaging is more appropriate than computed tomography for diagnosing vertigo because of its superiority in visualizing the posterior fossa, where most central nervous system disease that causes vertigo is found.

26Magnetic resonance or conventional angiography of the posterior fossa vasculature may be useful in diagnosing vascular causes of vertigo such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency, thrombosis of the labyrinthine artery, anterior or posterior inferior cerebellar artery insufficiency, and subclavian steal syndrome. 26 Neuroimaging studies can be used to rule out extensive bacterial infections, neoplasms, or developmental abnormalities if other symptoms suggest one of those diagnoses.

Ménière’s disease—hearing evaluation and asymmetry criteria: The AAO-HNS defines asymmetric hearing loss by pure-tone average (PTA; average threshold at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) between ears of >15 dB or a difference >15% between ears in word recognition scores (WRS). Patients without documented hearing loss during acute attacks or permanent threshold shifts on audiometry do not meet diagnostic criteria for definite Ménière’s disease and an alternative diagnosis should be considered. Patients whose WRSs are worse than expected for the PTA should be assessed for retrocochlear pathology including auditory neuropathy or vestibular schwannoma, and mixed low- to midfrequency loss warrants investigation for conductive causes including possible superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Because some patients develop bilateral disease, hearing should be documented in both ears; rehabilitation should consider both involved and noninvolved ears using PTA and WRS, and in profound loss in ≥1 affected ears, contralateral routing of sound (CROS) devices or cochlear implantation may be an option.

Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while “dizziness” is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### Delayed post gadolinium MRI descriptors for meniere's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fe8095d]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meniere’s disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder characterised by the clinical presentation of episodic vertigo, low- to mid-frequency hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms, with a potentially devastating impact on quality of life. Prevalence as high as 513/100,000 has been reported in population-based studies. A series of diagnostic criteria have been proposed by international societies, most recently in 1995 and 2015, which are largely based on the subjective reporting of symptoms and audiometry. However, MD may have variable manifestations, with the cardinal symptoms present in only 40% of patients with early disease. The ability of clinical criteria to capture atypical phenotypes and to distinguish MD from alternative diagnoses has also been questioned. Nevertheless, there have been no other reliable diagnostic methods until recently, with the conventional role of MRI being to exclude other pathologies.

Endolymphatic hydrops (EHs) refer to the expansion of the endolymphatic space (ES) of the inner ear at the expense of the surrounding perilymphatic space (PS) and is considered to be the histological hallmark of MD. The MRI depiction of EH with delayed post-gadolinium MRI was first described in 2007. The ability of MRI to demonstrate EH and diagnose MD with both intra-tympanic and intravenous contrast administration has been evaluated in subsequent studies. The utilisation of delayed post-gadolinium MRI has been a major advance in otological imaging, with increasing worldwide application and a consequent shift in the diagnostic paradigm of MD. Some recent MD classifications have even incorporated MRI within the diagnostic criteria.

The reporting of EH on MRI is generally based on the evaluation of descriptors and semi-quantitative grading scales [,,,,,,–] but there is little consensus on which of these perform best in distinguishing affected ears. Despite previous systematic reviews on the subject, there have been no attempts to determine the pooled diagnostic performance of MRI descriptors. Meta-analysis would provide greater certainty as to how MRI should be interpreted to optimally corroborate the diagnosis of MD. Furthermore, whilst previous systematic reviews have been applied to a narrowly defined reference clinical standard such as “definite MD”, another question relates to whether MRI is diagnostically useful in atypical or monosymptomatic forms, such as cochlear MD (cMD) and vestibular MD (vMD).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of MR descriptors in distinguishing ears with clinical MD, and how this differs between the MD clinical subcategories.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of definite or probable Ménière's disease, according to the agreed criteria of the American Academy Otolaryngology ‐ Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS), the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Bárány Society. These criteria are outlined in Appendix 1 and described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015.

If studies used different criteria to diagnose Ménière's disease, we included them if those criteria were clearly analogous to those described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015. For example, studies that used earlier definitions of Ménière's disease (from the AAO‐HNS guidelines of 1995) were also included.  If there was uncertainty over the criteria used for the study, then we made a decision on whether to include the study. This decision was taken by authors who were masked to other features of the studies (such as study size, other aspects of methodology, results of the study) to avoid the introduction of bias in study selection. If a study was conducted in an ENT department and participants were diagnosed with Ménière's disease then we considered it was likely that other diagnoses had been excluded, and included the study. However, we reflected this uncertainty in diagnosis by considering the study at risk of indirectness when using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence (see 'Summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence').

We anticipated that most studies would include participants with active Ménière's disease. We did not exclude studies if the frequency of attacks at baseline was not reported or was unclear, but we planned to highlight if there were differences between studies that may impact on our ability to pool the data, or affect the applicability of our findings.

We excluded studies where participants had previously undergone destructive/ablative treatment for Ménière's disease in the affected ear (such as vestibular neurectomy, chemical or surgical labyrinthectomy), as we considered that they were unlikely to respond to interventions in the same way as those who had not undergone such treatment.

### What is menière's disease? A contemporary re-evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops [^84a2cfad]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, the Classification Committee of the Bárány Society formulated diagnostic criteria for MD jointly with several national and international organizations. The classification includes two categories: definite MD and probable MD. The diagnosis of definite MD is based on clinical criteria and requires the observation of an episodic vertigo syndrome associated with low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus and/or fullness) in the affected ear. Duration of vertigo episodes is limited to a period between 20 min and 12 h. Probable MD is a broader concept defined by episodic vestibular symptoms (vertigo or dizziness) associated with fluctuating aural symptoms occurring in a period from 20 min to 24 h. These definitions unfortunately do not help the clinician in defining MD. One interesting difference is that the proposed definition does not include endolymphatic hydrops that was the original finding in the disease.

Recent novel imaging methods have made it possible to visualize EH with gadolinium contrasted 3T MRI. The AAO-HNS (1995) criteria include EH as landmark to define certain MD. Recently, Nakashima et al. suggested that the inner ear of all patients with suspected MD should be imaged and the classification as definite MD should include MRI evidence of EH. The authors propose that also monosymptomatic ears with EH could be treated as MD in the same way as in the 1972 AAO-HNS classification, which recognized vestibular MD and cochlear MD as one disease entity among the umbrella of MD. Supporting this idea, Pyykkö et al. reported that in about 20 % of the patients with MD it can take more than 5 years and in 10 % even more than 10 years before cochlear and vestibular symptoms will coincide.

To conclude, we propose that diagnosis of MD should be based on the presence of EH in addition to symptoms and that also monosymptomatic patients with EH be regarded as ‘certain’ MD cases. MRI investigations should be made more frequently in assessing MD than hitherto.

### Diagnostic challenges in vestibular migraine-clinical differentiation from menière's disease and discrepancies with current classification criteria [^a2af7bdb]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The two most common spontaneous episodic vestibular syndromes are vestibular migraine (VM) with a lifetime prevalence of 1%, followed by Menière’s disease (MD). VM and MD are sometimes difficult to differentiate, even for an experienced clinician after thorough history taking and clinical examination. Previously assumed differentiation criteria such as endolymphatic hydrops (EH) on contrast-enhanced high-resolution temporal bone MRI no longer provide a reliable basis for differentiation. While EH has been well-documented in MD, it recently was also found in patients with VM and other vestibular disorders.

This diagnostic ambiguity has prompted the development of standardized clinical criteria. In 2012 resp. 2015 diagnostic criteria for VM and MD were formulated with the framework of the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD) by the International Bárány Society for Neuro-Otology and were revised for VM in 2022 with regard to a literature update, but without essentially changing the criteria (see Table 1 for an overview of the current definitions). To complicate matters, there are no reliable specific symptoms for one or the other condition, e.g. that both headache and auditory symptoms may occur in VM and MD. Further, epidemiological studies revealed a coincidence of both conditions in individual patients ; this fact even led to the proposal of a classification of ‘VM/MD overlap syndrome’ as a new clinical syndrome of patients with definite VM and definite MD. This may pose uncertainties in the evaluation of the response of medical treatment and various subsequent therapeutic interventions may be required.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^9984c487]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Ménière's disease was first described by Prosper Ménière in 1861 as a condition characterised by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus (Baloh 2001). Sufferers may also report a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Typically, it initially affects one ear, although some individuals may progress to develop bilateral disease. A hallmark of the condition is that symptoms are intermittent ‐ occurring as discrete attacks that last from minutes to several hours, then resolve. However, over time there is usually a gradual deterioration in hearing, and there may be progressive loss of balance function, leading to chronic dizziness or vertigo.

The diagnosis of Ménière's disease is challenging, due to the episodic nature of the condition, clinical heterogeneity, and the lack of a 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Even the agreed, international classification system has scope for two categories of diagnosis – 'definite’ and 'probable' (Lopez‐Escamez 2015). In brief, a diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease requires at least two episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, together with audiometrically confirmed hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (reduction in hearing, tinnitus or fullness) in the affected ear. 'Probable' Ménière's disease includes similar features, but without the requirement for audiometry to diagnose hearing loss, and with scope for the vertigo episodes to last longer (up to 24 hours). Both categories ('definite' and 'probable') require that the symptoms are not more likely to be due to an alternative diagnosis, due to the recognised challenges in distinguishing between balance disorders.

### An update on the epidemiology and clinicodemographic features of meniere's disease [^cc10231b]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the estimated prevalence and clinicodemographic features of Ménière's disease (MD) using current diagnostic criteria.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was undertaken at our tertiary academic referral center. All patients seen in Otolaryngology clinic with ICD-10 diagnoses of MD, from January 1, 2013 to July 31, 2022 were identified. Chart review was undertaken to determine the estimated prevalence of MD meeting AAO-HNS diagnostic criteria. Clinicodemographic features were evaluated against a comparator group without MD seen in our health system.

Results

Of 806 ICD-10 diagnoses of MD, we identified 480 MD cases meeting diagnostic criteria (168 definite). Mean age at presentation for MD cases was 49years. Forty-seven percent of cases were male. A significantly higher proportion of MD cases than comparators were white (76% vs. 66%, p<0.001). Mean time since MD symptom onset was 6.7years, with a mean attack duration of 4.6h; 7.5% of MD cases reported a positive family history, and 7% had bilateral disease. The odds of reporting migraine were significantly greater among MD patients than comparators (OR 1.74 [1.26-2.42]); the odds of having autoimmune conditions were lower (OR 0.45 [0.28-0.74]); and the odds of reporting allergies were no different (OR 0.96 [0.74-1.25]) versus comparator patients after controlling for demographic characteristics.

Conclusions

Among MD diagnoses, there is a low estimated prevalence of MD meeting diagnostic criteria, and an even lower prevalence of definite MD. Compared to a comparator group of patients seen for any disorder, patients with MD are more likely to be white, male, and have a history of migraine.

### Ménière's disease: a challenging and relentless disorder [^b97b6e55]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus, and by the presence of endolymphatic hydrops on postmortem examination. This disease continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Patients with MD range from minimally symptomatic, highly functional individuals to severely affected, disabled patients. Current management strategies are designed to control the acute and recurrent vestibulopathy but offer minimal remedy for the progressive cochlear dysfunction. Recent research highlights the role of neurotoxicity in the pathogenesis of the cochleovestibular deterioration. This article discusses a patient with MD, and provides an algorithm for the management of this disease.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^1bf48ce9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of definite or probable Ménière's disease, according to the agreed criteria of the American Academy Otolaryngology ‐ Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS), the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Bárány Society. These criteria are outlined in Appendix 1 and described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015.

If studies used different criteria to diagnose Ménière's disease, we included them if those criteria were clearly analogous to those described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015. For example, studies that used earlier definitions of Ménière's disease (from the AAO‐HNS guidelines of 1995) were also included. If there was uncertainty over the criteria used for the study, then we made a decision on whether to include the study. This decision was taken by authors who were masked to other features of the studies (such as study size, other aspects of methodology, results of the study) to avoid the introduction of bias in study selection. If a study was conducted in an ENT department and participants were diagnosed with Ménière's disease then we considered it was likely that other diagnoses had been excluded, and included the study. However, we reflected this uncertainty in diagnosis by considering the study at risk of indirectness when using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence (see 'Summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence').

We anticipated that most studies would include participants with active Ménière's disease. We did not exclude studies if the frequency of attacks at baseline was not reported or was unclear, but we planned to highlight if there were differences between studies that may impact on our ability to pool the data, or affect the applicability of our findings.

We excluded studies where participants had previously undergone destructive/ablative treatment for Ménière's disease in the affected ear (such as vestibular neurectomy, chemical or surgical labyrinthectomy), as we considered that they were unlikely to respond to interventions in the same way as those who had not undergone such treatment.

Table 1 
Current definitions of vestibular migraine and Menière’s disease

Adapted from Lempert et al. 2022 for vestibular migraine and Lopez-Escamez et al. 2015 for Menière’s disease

The current diagnostic criteria are optimized to differentiate typical presentations of MD and VM, e.g. to define homogenous cohorts for clinical trials, but may pose difficulties in daily clinical care. For example, patients presenting with symptoms of VM, but without five previous attacks, currently cannot be classified as VM.

These diagnostic uncertainties and the revision of the diagnostic guidelines without changing the diagnostic criteria prompted us to collect real-world clinical features of these two spontaneous episodic vestibular syndromes, including potentially predictive symptoms, interictal ocular motor findings, vestibular diagnostic test results and additional parameters, that may enable differentiation beyond the current strict ICVD classification. The primary objective of this study was to characterize patients with VM and MD presenting at a specialized tertiary dizziness center and to identify factors that can effectively differentiate these two conditions. The second study aim was to investigate the reasons for discrepancies in diagnostic classification of VM based on clinical expert evaluations and ICVD criteria, specifically addressing the limitations of the conventional classification into (definite) VM and probable VM in the context of daily practice in a specialized outpatient setting.

In this article, the present state of the art with respect to audiovestibular testing for Meniere's disease (MD) is reviewed. There is no gold standard for MD diagnosis, and the classic dictum is that even the "best" tests yield positive results in only two-thirds of patients with MD. Still, we advocate the use and further investigation of advanced audiovestibular testing in patients with MD in an attempt to answer the questions that confront any clinician who cares for patients with audiovestibular symptoms.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^a7e211b5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness).

Although Ménière's disease is a relatively uncommon condition, the significant impact it has on quality of life demonstrates the clear importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate the symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first‐line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options, to support people with Ménière's disease (and healthcare professionals) when making decisions about their care.

### Long-term risk of progression from unilateral to bilateral Méniere's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cf528a39]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Méniere's disease (MD) is a debilitating disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodic vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The hallmark histopathologic feature, endolymphatic hydrops, has long been established in experimental and clinical study (–). However, despite over one-and-a-half centuries and a wealth of literature since Prosper Méniere first attempted to describe this disorder, there still remains much that is not fully understood about the pathophysiology, management, and clinical course of this disease.

Contemporary diagnosis of MD is based on clinical assessment alone, and the most recent set of criteria was established by international committee initially published by the Barany Society in 2015 and later agreed upon by the American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO). Objective tests, such as delayed post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrocochleography, are not essential but have been shown to be useful adjuncts in diagnosis and guiding management. MD can be a unilateral (UMD) or bilateral (BMD) process, and bilateral cases can be subclassified into synchronous or metachronous based on the onset of each ear. Additional classification systems have been described, separating patients based on features including migraine status, family history, autoimmune disease, and presence of delayed endolymphatic hydrops.

Diagnosis of Ménière's disease

For most studies, the diagnosis was made according to the AAO‐HNS 1995 criteria. Three studies did not report the use of these criteria:

Khan 2011 reported that participants were diagnosed in the ENT department of a military hospital, and required episodic vertigo (at least two definitive episodes of vertigo of at least 20 minutes duration), tinnitus and hearing loss (minimum hearing loss of 30 dB in any of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz).
Schmidt 1992 reported that the diagnosis was made according to the "Utrecht working definition", which comprised cochlear hearing loss, a history of tinnitus, history of attacks of vertigo and exclusion of other disease that could account for these symptoms. A specific diagnostic protocol was used to assess participants before inclusion in the study (see Characteristics of included studies for further details).
Ricci 1987 and Duphar B.V. 77.054/M did not describe their methods for diagnosing Ménière's disease, but as the studies were conducted in the ENT department of a hospital, we considered it likely that participants had other diagnoses excluded.

Four studies explicitly stated that only participants with definite Ménière's disease were included (Adrion 2016 ; Albu 2016 ; Derebery 2004 ; Park 2016). The remaining studies did not comment on whether participants with probable disease were also included.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^49af7655]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Ménière's disease was first described by Prosper Menière in 1861 as a condition characterised by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus (Baloh 2001). Sufferers may also report a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Typically, it initially affects one ear, although some individuals may progress to develop bilateral disease. A hallmark of the condition is that symptoms are intermittent ‐ occurring as discrete attacks that last from minutes to several hours, then resolve. However, over time there is usually a gradual deterioration in hearing, and there may be progressive loss of balance function, leading to chronic dizziness or vertigo.

The diagnosis of Ménière's disease is challenging, due to the episodic nature of the condition, clinical heterogeneity and the lack of a 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Even the agreed, international classification system has scope for two categories of diagnosis – 'definite' and 'probable' (Lopez‐Escamez 2015). In brief, a diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease requires at least two episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, together with audiometrically confirmed hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (reduction in hearing, tinnitus or fullness) in the affected ear. 'Probable' Ménière's disease includes similar features, but without the requirement for audiometry to diagnose hearing loss, and with scope for the vertigo episodes to last longer (up to 24 hours). Both categories ('definite' and 'probable') require that the symptoms are not more likely to be due to an alternative diagnosis, due to the recognised challenges in distinguishing between balance disorders.

### The differences in caloric test and vHIT results between menière's disease and vestibular migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2e200b46]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Because of different prognosis and therapeutic options, diagnosing patients with vertigo attacks correctly is essential. This can be challenging when patients present with symptoms that are not specific to a single disease, often referred to as an overlap syndrome. Menière's disease (MD) and vestibular migraine (VM) may manifest in various, and sometimes similar, ways.That is, VM patients may present without migraine headache, one of the distinctive features in differentiating VM from MD. Moreover, aural symptoms are typical for MD, but are also experienced by VM patients; and hearing loss in MD may not occur until later in the course of the disease. Currently, the diagnoses of MD and VM are based on clinical history and the result of audiometric testing, as reported by the internationally accepted criteria by the Bárány Society and the International Headache Society. Various studies suggest that vestibular testing may serve as a valuable supportive tool in diagnosis. This raises the question of the diagnostic value of vestibular function tests in differentiating between MD and VM in cases of recurrent spontaneous vertigo attacks without hearing loss or typical migrainous features.

The current literature describes caloric hypofunction in up to 71% of MD patients, compared with rates up to 28% in VM. However, earlier studies indicate a trend of increasing asymmetry in the caloric response with advancement of the disease in MD,, making it a less distinctive feature for early diagnosis.Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) gains are often reported to be normal in both disorders. Vestibular function tests are currently not part of the diagnostic criteria for MD as there are no sufficient high-quality RCTs, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses reporting high diagnostic testing accuracy for MD.Also for VM, there is difficulty in applying vestibular testing in the diagnostic approach, mainly due the fact that vestibular hypofunction is not pathognomonic for VM.Nevertheless, it may still provide valuable insights for guiding diagnosis or clinical management.The aim of this systematic review of the literature is therefore to present an overview of the differences in the results of caloric testing and vHIT between MD and VM patients, aiming to guide clinicians with patients who do not (yet) fulfill the diagnostic criteria by the Bárány Society and the International Headache Society. This may help in differentiating between MD and VM. To the best of our knowledge, to date no meta-analysis addressing this topic has been published.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^c85216bc]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière’s disease—differential diagnosis features highlight that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo presents as positional vertigo lasting less than a minute (ie, seconds) and is not associated with hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness, whereas vestibular migraine can have attacks lasting minutes or >24 hours with hearing loss less likely and migraine history common. Labyrinthitis produces sudden severe vertigo with profound hearing loss and prolonged vertigo (ie, >24 hours) that is not episodic or fluctuating. Vestibular neuritis reflects a viral infection leading to acute prolonged vertigo with prolonged nausea and vomiting without hearing loss, with table notes that severe rotational vertigo lasts 12 to 36 hours with decreasing disequilibrium for the next 4 to 5 days. Stroke/ischemia may cause vertigo lasting minutes with nausea, vomiting, severe imbalance and drop attacks, with deficits often permanent and nonfluctuating.

Barany diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine (VM) state that diagnosis requires “At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours,” plus a “Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD),” and “One or more migraine features with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes” (headache with “at least two of the following characteristics: one sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity,” “photophobia and phonophobia,” or “visual aura”), and episodes “Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis.” Probable vestibular migraine requires “At least 5 episodes with vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours,” but with “Only one of the criteria B and C for vestibular migraine is fulfilled (migraine history or migraine features during the episode)” and also “Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis.” Qualifying vestibular symptoms include “Spontaneous vertigo including: o Internal vertigo, a false sensation of self-motion, and o External vertigo, a false sensation that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing,” “Position vertigo, occurring after a change in head position,” “Visually-induced vertigo, triggered by a complex or large moving visual stimulus,” “Head motion-induced vertigo, occurring during head motion,” and “Head motion-induced dizziness with nausea”; severity is “moderate” when they “interfere with but do not prohibit daily activities” and “severe” if “daily activities cannot be continued.” Visual auras “typically expand over 5–20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes.”

### Efficacy and safety of betahistine treatment in patients with meniere's disease: primary results of a long term, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, dose defining trial (BEMED trial) [^7f8e7cb7]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Several clinical studies assessing the effect of betahistine on the vestibular system and, to a lesser degree, audiological symptoms suggested that the drug improved these symptoms.According to a Cochrane systematic review of betahistine for Meniere’s disease or syndrome, there is, however, insufficient evidence to indicate whether betahistine has any effect.So far, randomised controlled trials that meet high quality standards are lacking, either due to inadequate diagnostic criteria or methods,or because the effect of betahistine treatment on vertigo was assessed inadequately. To summarise, the limitations of the evidence base for preventive treatment strategies for Meniere’s disease include:

• Predominance of trials investigating short term effects (treatment periods of six months or less)
• Inclusion criteria of enrolled patients (for instance, no differentiation between patients with the disease and patients with other causes of vertigo)
• High dropout rateswith potential for considerable attrition bias
• Small trials or few placebo controlled trials
• Varying quality of outcome measures for assessing efficacy (including quality of life scores, functional impairment, disability, and the number and severity of acute attacks of vertigo).

The dose of betahistine in these studies varied between 16 and 72 mg per day, which might explain the differences in symptom relief observed. Even higher doses of up to 480 mg per day have shown benefit for severe cases in a small case series, suggesting a possible effect of high dose regimens in the treatment of Meniere’s disease.The drug seems to retain a good tolerability profile. On the basis of many years’ clinical experience, the dose was successively increased to 48 mg three times a day, pointing towards the role of long term treatment (up to 12 months). This dose increase was supported by an open, uncontrolled, non-masked study without a placebo arm that compared a high dose regimen of 48 mg three times daily with the recommended standard dose of 16 or 24 mg three times daily.This non-interventional study showed that the higher dose was superior to the lower dose, and that the treatment effect of betahistine on the incidence of attacks of vertigo became more prominent over time.

The current guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery entrust the diagnosis of Ménière disease (MD) only to the clinical presentation and the pure tone audiometry. However, most otolaryngologists request a widened instrumental evaluation of the patients suspected of MD. The effective reliability of the further instrumental support for the diagnosis of MD is still debated in the literature because of nonstandardized procedures and sometimes incoherence among authors. New and more sophisticated diagnostic tests have been developed both in audiovestibology and in imaging in the last few years. A review of the recent literature on this controversial subject is provided.

### Vestibular migraine or meniere's disease: a diagnostic dilemma [^886878c7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meniere's disease (MD) represents one of the vertigo disorders characterized by triad symptoms (recurrent vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus or ear fullness). The diagnosis of MD relies on the accurate and detailed taking of medical history, and the differentiation between MD and vestibular migraine (VM) is of critical importance from the perspective of the treatment efficacy. VM is a highly prevalent vertigo condition and its typical symptoms (headache, vestibular symptoms, cochlear symptoms) mimic those of MD. Furthermore, the misdiagnosis in MD and VM could lead to VM patients mistakenly receiving the traumatic treatment protocol designed for MD, and sustaining unnecessary damage to the inner ear. Fortunately, thanks to the advances in examination technologies, the barriers to their differentiation are being gradually removed. These advances enhance the diagnostic accuracy of vertigo diseases, especially VM and MD. This review focused on the differentiation of VM and MD, with an attempt to synthesize existing data on the relevant battery of differentiation diagnosis (covering core symptoms, auxiliary tests [audiometry, vestibular tests, endolymphatic hydrops tests]) and longitudinal follow-up. Since the two illnesses are overlapped in all aspects, no single test is sufficiently specific on its own, however, patterns containing all or at least some features boost specificity.

Ménière's Disease

Prosper Ménière first described a series of patients with episodes of vertigo and hearing loss in 1861. Prior to this it was assumed vertigo attacks originated in the brain in a mechanism akin to strokes or seizures, however included in this series of patients was the autopsy of a young girl with vertigo and hearing loss with an inner ear hemorrhage, the first account that convincingly demonstrated that vertigo could originate in the inner ear. Classically, it has been theorized that Ménière's disease (MD) results from so-called endolymphatic hydrops, or and excessive buildup of endolymphatic fluid in the inner ear. More recently, this theory has been called into question since not all patients with endolymphatic hydrops (on temporal bone histopathology) have MD, although all patients with MD appear to have endolymphatic hydrops.

The diagnostic criteria for MD were most recently updated in 2015 and are separated into definite MD and probable MD. Definite MD is characterized by at least two episodes of vertigo lasting between 20 ​min and 12 ​h, an audiogram demonstrating low to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear, fluctuating aural symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in the affected ear, and the symptoms should not be better accounted for by another disorder. Probable MD allows for attacks to last up to 24 ​h instead of 12 and excludes the audiogram criteria. Vestibular testing – including vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, electrocochleography, head impulse testing, and especially calorics may demonstrate vestibular dysfunction ipsilateral to the hearing loss, although abnormal results do not contribute to the diagnostic criteria of MD.

### Inner ear pathologies impair sodium-regulated ion transport in meniere's disease [^07bba8b8]. Acta Neuropathologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Further studies will address the questions of (1) how the respective ES pathologies can be distinguished in clinical MD patients; (2) whether different ES pathologies are associated with clinically meaningful prognostic subgroups of MD patients; (3) whether diminished eES epithelial function in MD is, in fact, a critical predisposing pathology in the pathogenesis of clinical MD symptoms; and, if so, (4) how eES function can be restored. Moreover, future histopathological studies need to take into consideration newly emerging disease concepts, such as migraine-associated vertigo syndromes, in order to answer the question of whether the clinical (phenotypic) resemblance between those syndromes and “classic” MD is due to similar (etio)pathological traits in the inner ear or whether the eES pathologies described here are a distinguishing feature of MD. However, such studies will require the continued prospective collection of postmortem temporal bone specimens from patients whose clinical history has been carefully documented according to the latest diagnostic consensus criteria.

Conclusions

In view of the evident overlap in clinical symptoms and intrinsic pathogenesis, more attention should be paid to the differentiation between MD and VM. It is high time we gave up the mindset that over-emphasizes clinical signs of vestibular diseases and adopted a multiple-perspective approach that focus on the core symptoms and signs, audiologic function, vestibular function, and follow-up. This multiple-pronged approach entails that, at the initial diagnosis stage, vestibular-auditory tests should weigh as much as history taking, to avoid mis-diagnosis up to the hilt. In the follow-up, the clinical course of the disease and the efficacy of the initial therapy should be meticulously monitored to confirm or revise our initial diagnosis.

### Meniere's disease [^c00f68ea]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Meniere's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. The aetiology of MD is multifactorial. A characteristic sign of MD is endolymphatic hydrops (EH), a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells. In most patients, the clinical symptoms of MD present after considerable accumulation of endolymph has occurred. However, some patients develop symptoms in the early stages of EH. The reason for the variability in the symptomatology is unknown and the relationship between EH and the clinical symptoms of MD requires further study. The diagnosis of MD is based on clinical symptoms but can be complemented with functional inner ear tests, including audiometry, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, caloric testing, electrocochleography or head impulse tests. MRI has been optimized to directly visualize EH in the cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canals, and its use is shifting from the research setting to the clinic. The management of MD is mainly aimed at the relief of acute attacks of vertigo and the prevention of recurrent attacks. Therapeutic options are based on empirical evidence and include the management of risk factors and a conservative approach as the first line of treatment. When medical treatment is unable to suppress vertigo attacks, intratympanic gentamicin therapy or endolymphatic sac decompression surgery is usually considered. This Primer covers the pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, management, quality of life and prevention of MD.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

If statistical heterogeneity was identified for any comparison, we planned to assess this considering the following subgroups:

Different comparators.
Different pressures/duration/frequency of administration.
Use of concomitant treatment.
Diagnosis of Ménière's disease.

However, due to the paucity of data available, and the few meta‐analyses included in this review, we did not carry out any subgroup analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

We planned to carry out a number of sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes in this review. However, the paucity of data and the lack of meta‐analyses has meant that this was not possible.

If few studies are identified for meta‐analysis, the random‐effects model may provide an inaccurate measure of the between‐studies variance. Therefore, we explored the impact of using a fixed‐effect model using a sensitivity analysis ‐ the results are very similar (Table 3).

Sensitivity analysis

If there was uncertainty over the diagnostic criteria used for participants in the studies (for example, if it is not clear whether participants were diagnosed using criteria that are analogous to the AAO‐HNS criteria) then we also planned to explore this by including/excluding those studies from the analysis. However, all the included studies reported inclusion of participants with definite Ménière's disease, according to the AAO‐HNS 1995 guidelines.

We used the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Screening Tool to identify any studies with concerns over the data available. We had intended that any studies identified by the tool would be excluded from the main analyses in the review, but that we would explore the impact of including the data from these studies through a sensitivity analysis. However, as noted above, we had some concerns over the use of this tool, and few studies were included in the review, therefore this sensitivity analysis was not conducted.

Diagnosis of Ménière's disease

For most studies, the diagnosis was made according to the AAO‐HNS 1995 criteria. A single study did not state the use of these criteria for making a diagnosis of Ménière's disease (Borghei 2016), and instead simply stated that "all patients with intractable Ménière's disease" were included in the study. As the study was conducted in an ENT department, we assume that participants were appropriately investigated to confirm the diagnosis, but we have reflected this uncertainty in our GRADE assessment of the evidence (where relevant).

Three studies explicitly stated that only participants with definite Ménière's disease were included (Garduno‐Anaya 2005 ; Lambert 2012 ; Lambert 2016). Two further studies are likely to have included participants with definite disease, as they stated that the AAO‐HNS 1995 criteria were used, and also required the presence of "documented asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss" (AVERTS‐1 ; AVERTS‐2 ; NCT03664674). The remaining trials did not comment on whether participants with probable disease were also included.

Features of Ménière's disease

Most studies specifically stated that participants with only unilateral disease were included (AVERTS‐1 ; AVERTS‐2 ; Garduno‐Anaya 2005 ; Lambert 2012 ; Lambert 2016 ; NCT02265393 ; NCT03664674). The remaining studies did not state whether participants had unilateral or bilateral disease.

The majority of studies gave no information regarding the duration of Ménière's symptoms. Where the duration of symptoms was reported, the majority of participants had experienced symptoms for up to five years. Most participants in Borghei 2016 had symptoms for five years or less (88.9%), with the majority being within two years of diagnosis (about 50%). This was similar for Lambert 2016, where around 60% of participants had symptoms for five years or less, but some had symptoms for over 15 years. Approximately half of the participants in El Shafei 2020 had symptoms for a year or less, and the remainder had been diagnosed within the past five years.

Supporting text—Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and amplification considerations in Ménière’s disease (MD) state that “SNHL is one of the key criteria for the diagnosis of MD” and that “No medical or surgical intervention has yet been shown to effectively prevent or correct SNHL associated with MD.” Early disease fluctuations complicate fitting, as “Fitting hearing aids in mild, fluctuating SNHL is difficult, as an initially successful fitting may be followed by complaints that the sound is too soft, too loud, or distorted soon thereafter,” and “overamplification could induce permanent SNHL due to excessive exposure to high-level acoustic stimuli.” Over time, “fluctuation tends to wane and progress to nonusable hearing in the affected ear.” Regarding devices, “Conventional hearing aids involve a microphone, an amplifier, and a speaker that increases sound volume in the affected ear” and “These are typically custom fit to an individual’s SNHL based on audiometric testing.”

Diagnostic criteria and nomenclature applied to human cases

We classified archival TB samples from humans with EH based primarily on the etiology of EH, which can be either secondary or idiopathic. By definition, secondary EH is associated with a history of certain otological or systemic diseases that are believed to cause secondary EH, although the detailed pathophysiological connection between the diseases and secondary EH is mostly unknown. In contrast to secondary EH, idiopathic EH, by definition, occurs spontaneously and has unknown etiology. In the present study, patients were classified as having secondary EH when their clinical records mentioned one or more of the diseases that supposedly cause secondary EH (Supplementary Table 2), and patients were classified as having idiopathic EH when their medical history was negative for those diseases. Next, patients with idiopathic EH were classified as having MD when their history of otological symptoms matched the diagnostic criteria for “definite” MD. Patients with secondary EH were classified as having Meniere’s symptom complex when their clinical records fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for “definite” MD. All individuals without a clinical history of MD or Meniere’s symptom complex, respectively, were classified as having had other otological (non-Meniere’s-like) symptoms or no otological symptoms (see also Table 1).

Ménière’s disease—use of vestibular function testing and electrocochleography (ECoChG) in diagnosis: Patients with a history and symptoms consistent with MD should not routinely undergo formal vestibular function testing or ECoChG to establish the diagnosis of MD, and MD remains a clinical diagnosis based on patient-reported symptomatology and audiometric data. Diagnostic yield is limited and variable: in an SR of ECoChG accuracy, the sensitivity of ECoChG ranged from 66% to 85.7%, and specificity ranged from 80% to 100%; the protocol and analysis to perform ECoChG have not been standardized, and clinicians should be mindful that elevation of the SP/AP amplitude and area ratio is not unique to patients with MD and may also be observed with a third mobile window such as a superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Caloric testing is best used to identify unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction, and in cross-sectional studies and case series of patients with MD, 65% of patients have unilateral weakness noted on caloric testing, thus a substantial proportion of MD patients are expected to have normal results. Policy level: Recommendation against.

### Vestibular migraine or meniere's disease: a diagnostic dilemma [^35f7075a]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meniere’s disease (MD) represents one of the vertigo disorders characterized by triad symptoms (recurrent vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus or ear fullness). The diagnosis of MD relies on the accurate and detailed taking of medical history, and the differentiation between MD and vestibular migraine (VM) is of critical importance from the perspective of the treatment efficacy. VM is a highly prevalent vertigo condition and its typical symptoms (headache, vestibular symptoms, cochlear symptoms) mimic those of MD. Furthermore, the misdiagnosis in MD and VM could lead to VM patients mistakenly receiving the traumatic treatment protocol designed for MD, and sustaining unnecessary damage to the inner ear. Fortunately, thanks to the advances in examination technologies, the barriers to their differentiation are being gradually removed. These advances enhance the diagnostic accuracy of vertigo diseases, especially VM and MD. This review focused on the differentiation of VM and MD, with an attempt to synthesize existing data on the relevant battery of differentiation diagnosis (covering core symptoms, auxiliary tests [audiometry, vestibular tests, endolymphatic hydrops tests]) and longitudinal follow-up. Since the two illnesses are overlapped in all aspects, no single test is sufficiently specific on its own, however, patterns containing all or at least some features boost specificity.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of definite or probable Ménière's disease, according to the agreed criteria of the American Academy Otolaryngology ‐ Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS), the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Bárány Society. These criteria are outlined in Appendix 1 and described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015.

If studies used different criteria to diagnose Ménière's disease, we included them if those criteria were clearly analogous to those described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015. For example, studies that used earlier definitions of Ménière's disease (from the AAO‐HNS guidelines of 1995) were also included. If there was uncertainty over the criteria used for the study, then a decision was made on whether to include the study. This decision was taken by authors who were masked to other features of the studies (such as study size, other aspects of methodology, results of the study) to avoid the introduction of bias in study selection. If a study was conducted in an ENT department and participants were diagnosed with Ménière's disease then we considered it was likely that other diagnoses had been excluded and included the study. However, we reflected this uncertainty in diagnosis by considering the study at risk of indirectness when using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence (see 'Summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence').

We anticipated that most studies would include participants with active Ménière's disease. We did not exclude studies if the frequency of attacks at baseline was not reported or was unclear, but we planned to highlight if there were differences between studies that may impact on our ability to pool the data, or affect the applicability of our findings.

We excluded studies where participants had previously undergone destructive/ablative treatment for Ménière's disease in the affected ear (such as vestibular neurectomy, chemical or surgical labyrinthectomy), as we considered that they were unlikely to respond to interventions in the same way as those who had not undergone such treatment.

Statement 3. Audiometric testing—Clinicians should obtain an audiogram when assessing a patient for the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease. Strong recommendation with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, Level of confidence in evidence: High, and Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. The purpose is to highlight the importance of obtaining audiometric data on all patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of MD. Audiometry is necessary to differentiate probable versus definite MD and the audiogram is required to move from a diagnosis of possible MD to definite MD. Audiometry should include pure tone air conduction thresholds bilaterally, ruling out or quantifying any conductive component of the hearing loss (bone conduction thresholds, tympanometry, acoustic reflex measures, and/or otoscopy), and including a measure of speech recognition (ie, word recognition/discrimination score [WRS]) in each ear. If audiometric testing is not available for the initial otolaryngology evaluation, tuning fork evaluation can be used to identify asymmetric hearing loss and whether there is a conductive component to the loss, but a recent systematic review “does not support the individual reliance on tuning fork tests for clinical screening and surgical candidacy assessment.” Role of patient preferences: Small; Exclusions: None; Intentional vagueness: None; Policy level: Strong recommendation; and for this document, “low- to midfrequency hearing loss” refers to audiometric frequencies ≤2000 Hz.

### What is menière's disease? A contemporary re-evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops [^b4f2dbce]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Relationship between histologically proven EH and clinical definite Menière’s disease

Despite the development of several animal models of EH, none of these models displays the typical phenotype observed in human MD patients: paroxysmal audiovestibular events plus chronic-progressive loss of inner ear functions. Therefore, we shall concentrate on evidence from human patients when considering the relationship between EH and clinical MD in patients.

In a recent review, Foster et al. analyzed all published articles that have reported on temporal bones with EH and/or on temporal bones of patients with clinically suspected MD. This resulted in a total of 3707 temporal bone specimens. Of these, 165 cases had been reported to fulfill the AAO-HNS 1995 criteria. Two of these studies were specifically designed to explore the relationship of EH to MD that meets the AAO-HNS 1995 criteria, and found EH in 100 % of MD cases. 163 of the temporal bones from definite MD patients in this review (98.8 %) had EH in at least one ear. Only two of 165 cases had been classified as MD without EH, and these cases were mentioned incidentally in a single study of strial changes in the contralateral ear of MD patients. Foster et al. communicated with the authors of that study and report that both cases were diagnosed before the AAO-HNS 1995 criteria, and that their clinical presentation was not described so it is impossible to verify whether they fulfilled the AAO-HNS criteria during their lifetime. None of these cases can be used to refute the primary finding of the Merchant study that EH and MD are found in association with 100 % of cases when the current definition of MD is strictly applied.

This indicates that it is virtually certain that EH is present in at least 1 temporal bone in a person who meets current MD criteria. The authors conclude that EH is unlikely to be just an epiphenomenon of MD, because the association is perfect: every case with MD according to the AAO-HNS criteria showed EH. It seems, therefore, that EH is necessary but not sufficient for the display of the full symptom triad of MD.

### Pathogenesis and etiology of Ménière disease: a scoping review of a century of evidence [^d0794d8a]. JAMA Otolaryngology-- Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Ménière disease is a rare chronic benign disorder of the inner ear with a natural history of multiple clinical phenotypes of variable severity and a tendency to burnout with time. Although multiple treatment modalities have been shown to improve the disease process-some adversely affecting cochleovestibular function-it remains uncertain whether one, several separate, or a combination of pathophysiologic mechanisms affect the disease process. A scoping review of the evidence underlying proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms of Ménière disease is needed to determine which processes are most likely to be etiopathogenic factors.

Observations

Of the 4602 relevant articles found through Embase, Ovid, and PubMed, 444 met inclusion criteria. The most common reported causes of Ménière disease were autoimmune or immune-mediated, genetic, or structural dysfunction of the inner ear. During the study period from inception to March 2021, etiologic theories shifted from structural dysfunction to autoimmune and genetic causes of Ménière disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

This scoping review found that Ménière disease is a multifactorial disease with lifelong comorbidities and loss of quality-associated life-years whose most commonly reported causes were structural dysfunction, immunologic damage, and genetic susceptibility. Recent studies have examined how autoinflammatory processes and vestibular migraine may be associated with Ménière disease. Large heterogeneity among studies may be explained by historical differences in the clinical understanding of the disease, as well as evolving intervention methodologies and practitioner expertise. Ménière disease is a multifactorial disease with lifelong comorbidities and loss of quality-associated life-years; therefore, future studies of reliable biomarkers of endolymphatic hydrops and real-time imaging are warranted to improve understanding and treatment.

### Prognostic implications of and audiometric evidence for hearing fluctuation in meniere's disease [^aeb1f85f]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

1) To establish criteria for significant hearing fluctuation by assessing the range and occurrence of hearing fluctuations over the course of Meniere's disease; 2) to determine if audiometric evidence exists to support the notion that Meniere's disease is a pathophysiologic process involving the whole cochlea; and 3) to suggest prognostic implications for initial hearing fluctuation in patients with Meniere's disease.

Study Design

Retrospective case series review.

Methods

A total of 488 patients diagnosed by 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Meniere's disease criteria for whom audiometric data were prospectively collected (2 cohorts: 341 and 146 patients initially seen between April 2002 to July 2003 and between January to December 2010, respectively). Based on several definitions for significant hearing fluctuation, change in hearing was categorized as "same," "worse," or "better" between any two consecutive evaluations. The relationship of initial hearing fluctuation to future hearing fluctuation and future hearing loss was evaluated.

Results

Hearing fluctuation was evident in Meniere's disease patients with heterogeneous audiometric follow-up; and the characteristics of these hearing fluctuations, including the mean incidence, is described. Audiometric data suggests that there is a high congruence in Meniere's disease between changes in low- and high-frequency thresholds. Initial hearing fluctuation is associated with the occurrence of future and more frequent hearing fluctuations.

Conclusion

Understanding the range of hearing fluctuations establishes a basis for determining audiometric thresholds used in evaluating future therapeutic trials aimed at the prevention of hearing loss in Meniere's disease. This knowledge will also inform the counseling directed toward patients diagnosed with Meniere's disease.

### Efficacy and safety of betahistine treatment in patients with meniere's disease: primary results of a long term, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, dose defining trial (BEMED trial) [^6178b02a]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Studies that support a beneficial effect of betahistine on Meniere’s disease have been mostly observational. On the one hand, non-randomised studies tend to show larger treatment effects compared to randomised controlled trials, and tend to overestimate the magnitude of a potential treatment effect.On the other hand, there is the question of whether bias alone can explain the large effect differences between observational and experimental studies. There could also be a problem of external validity for the trial under consideration. Below, we reconsider these aspects using the PICO approach (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) to discuss the strengths and limitations of the BEMED trial.

Strengths and limitations

Patient population

The BEMED trial population (n=221) was selected from 1450 screened patients. Patients were diagnosed with definite Meniere’s disease according to the criteria of the 1995 AAO-HNS guidelineand the new schema for diagnosis of Meniere’s disease previously ratified by the Bárány Society,which are widely accepted and provide sufficient diagnostic accuracy.The mean monthly attack rate during the first month of treatment was about 5.7, which is considered as representative for patients with Meniere’s disease and being treated with betahistine. The population could have also included patients with vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, and secondary functional dizziness, which is typical for many Meniere’s disease studies.

Intervention

The duration of exposure to study treatment was similar across the three treatment groups and ranged between a mean of 214 and 224 days for the intention to treat population. About 75% of patients completed the nine month treatment period.

Control group

The BEMED trial decided to implement a placebo arm for ethical and compliance reasons. Our placebo results may not fully reflect Meniere’s disease’s natural history.

Types of interventions

We included the following intervention:

positive pressure therapy.

The main comparison is:

positive pressure therapy versus placebo/no treatment.

Concurrent treatments

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We pooled studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment. We planned to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment. However, due to the small number of studies included in the review this was not possible (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^9d035fb2]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière’s disease—clinical follow-up, vertigo control, hearing loss, and quality of life (QOL) assessment are outlined as follows: One of the major goals of therapy is adequate control of vertigo. Follow-up to determine a patient’s level of control of vertigo with current therapy allows for changes in therapy if control is inadequate or potential reduction in therapy if patients have complete vertigo control. Hearing loss is another variable component of MD, although in most cases it progresses with longer duration of disease, and hearing impairment can be divided into low frequency, mostly prominent in early stages, and high frequency, which can manifest in later stages of the disease process; audiometric testing is an important component of follow-up to inform further therapeutic or rehabilitative options. Determination of adequate follow-up for MD is dependent on the severity and progression of the disease, and if vertigo is not adequately controlled, if hearing loss is progressive, or if the patient is experiencing more frequent drop attacks, there may be alternate therapeutic options. Patients with severe or progressive disease should have more frequent follow-up, but those who have stabilized or have fewer disabling symptoms may not require it as frequently. Utilizing baseline assessment and frequent follow-up in the early stages of the disease will allow for accurate and effective therapy, including, but not limited to, aural/vestibular rehabilitation, and a questionnaire that establishes a baseline assessment to outline patient needs may help dictate the long-term surveillance schedule that will afford the patient and physician the best opportunity to optimize outcome. Measurement of QOL before and after therapeutic interventions can provide a valuable tool for evaluation of long-term effect and outcome data development, and the CPG currently does not recommend a specific QOL measure over another; rather, this CPG recommends that the provider use a measure that will lead to a consistent evaluation of the MD patient.

Overall, with adequate medical therapy, allergy workup, and immunotherapy for patients with known diagnoses of allergies, the author's clinic has been able to help more than 85% of its patients who present with symptoms of Meniere's disease. For intractable cases where autoimmune phenomena can be suspected with a strong degree of suspicion, the author's clinic has also treated patients with immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and/or methotrexate in a low dose.

### Predictive nomograms and an algorithm for managing patients with probable meniere's disease [^1e5fcbfe]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore the efficacy of diagnostic tests in accurately reclassifying patients initially diagnosed with probable Meniere's disease (MD) into either definite or non-MD categories.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a neurotology clinic between 1/2016 and 5/2022. Patients underwent a battery of tests, from which sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as positive and negative likelihood ratios, were calculated. Additionally, prediction nomograms were developed.

Results

Of the 69 patients, 25 (36.2 %) were initially classified as definite MD, 21 (30.4 %), probable MD, and 23 (33.4 %) non-MD. The mean follow-up was 3.5 years. The sensitivity of electrocochleography (ECochG) was the highest (92 %), with a negative likelihood ratio of 15 %. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MD-protocol had the highest specificity (100 %), with a positive likelihood ratio of 100 %. Videonystagmography, video head impulse test, and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, had lower sensitivity and specificity. We were able to reclassify 18 (86 %) patients with probable MD: 12 (57 %) were diagnosed with definite MD, and 6 (29 %) were diagnosed with non-MD, consistent with their clinical course.

Conclusions

The combination of ECochG and MRI with MD-protocol provides the most reliable approach to reclassify patients with Probable MD, ensuring a precise and accurate diagnosis. Vestibular tests express the functional status of the labyrinth and may not be reliable. Our findings provide valuable insights into clinical decision-making for patients with Probable MD and raise the consideration of additional diagnostic tests as supplementary to the existing clinical-only diagnosis criteria.

Subjects with definite Ménière's disease (Group 1), differential diagnosis (Group 2: another audiovestibular diseases or neurologic disorders), and normal hearing (Group 3) were included. Sample sizes were calculated.

Interventions

Study test (CHAMP) was compared with the current clinical criterion standard described by the guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.

Main Outcome Measure

Sensitivity, specificity, and other indicators of diagnostic validation.

Results

One hundred ten cases completed the follow-up, and their results are presented. Sensitivity at 31.3% and specificity at 100% were found in subjects with definite Ménière's disease, features that are more helpful in confirming the diagnosis than in rejecting it. Group 1 showed significantly shorter latency delays than Groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

If definite Ménière's disease is suspected, an abnormal result confirms the diagnosis; however, a normal result does not rule out the Ménière's disease diagnosis.
