## Question

A 52-year-old woman is referred to your surgical clinic after an incidental finding of a 7 cm left adrenal mass on abdominal CT performed for evaluation of abdominal pain. She has a BMI of 38 kg/m² and a history of hypertension, but no prior abdominal surgeries. Hormonal workup is negative for pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, or aldosteronism. There is no radiological evidence of local invasion or metastasis, and the radiologist's report suggests the lesion is likely a benign adenoma. You are the surgeon tasked with planning her adrenalectomy.

Based on current SAGES guidelines, what is the preferred surgical approach for this patient, and what factors support your choice?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting the best surgical approach for a 7 cm, nonfunctioning, left adrenal incidentaloma in a 52-year-old woman with a BMI of 38 kg/m², no prior abdominal surgery, and no evidence of local invasion or metastasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether surgery is indicated at all for a nonfunctioning adrenal mass of this size. Then, I should verify which minimally invasive approaches are acceptable and how surgeon expertise influences choice. Next, I will examine how tumor size and patient BMI shift the balance toward a lateral transabdominal versus retroperitoneal approach. After that, I need to check for any red flags that would push me to an open operation. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note contingencies like conversion and learning-curve considerations.

> Let me first confirm the indication for surgery, because I should not jump to an approach before ensuring we should operate. For a 7 cm nonfunctioning adrenal mass, malignancy risk rises with size, and contemporary endocrine guidance supports considering resection for lesions ≥ 4 cm even when imaging is indeterminate, particularly in younger patients, given the nontrivial risk of adrenocortical carcinoma and the difficulty of long-term surveillance in larger masses, so surgery is reasonable here after shared decision-making [^b05aab10] [^2fd583b8].

> Next, I should review the overarching principle for approach selection. SAGES emphasizes that surgeons should choose the minimally invasive technique they are most familiar with, have been trained in, and achieve the best outcomes with, because outcomes hinge on surgeon expertise as much as the approach itself, and both transperitoneal and retroperitoneal laparoscopic methods are acceptable when performed by experienced hands [^3ac74bc9] [^d7a97019].

> Now, I will examine how tumor size influences approach. Large adrenal tumors, generally > 6 cm, are more challenging due to limited working space and the need for mobilization. SAGES notes that the lateral transabdominal approach offers greater working space and improved feasibility for large tumors compared with retroperitoneal approaches, albeit with potential for longer operative times and higher conversion in larger masses, so for a 7 cm lesion I should lean toward a lateral transabdominal approach if my expertise supports it [^8c96c6a6] [^43761e05] [^547ccc3c].

> Hold on, I should verify how obesity modifies this choice. With a BMI of 38 kg/m², the lateral transabdominal approach is again favored because the lateral decubitus position and gravity-assisted retraction improve exposure in morbid obesity, whereas the posterior retroperitoneal approach can be technically limited by the depth of the retroperitoneal space and fatty tissue obscuring landmarks; SAGES specifically recommends the lateral transabdominal approach in morbidly obese patients and for large tumors, which fits this scenario [^8c96c6a6] [^f1cbcbf0] [^2ed3dfcf].

> Wait, let me verify whether a retroperitoneal approach could still be reasonable. The posterior retroperitoneoscopic approach has advantages in patients with prior abdominal surgery and for bilateral adrenalectomies, but it is less suitable for very large tumors and can be more difficult in obesity; since this patient has no prior abdominal surgery and a solitary 7 cm mass, those relative advantages do not apply, so the lateral transabdominal approach remains preferable if I am facile with it [^2ed3dfcf] [^8c96c6a6].

> I should confirm that there are no malignancy red flags mandating an open operation. There is no radiologic evidence of local invasion or metastasis, and the lesion is described as likely benign, so minimally invasive adrenalectomy is appropriate. However, I need to ensure a low threshold to convert to open if I encounter intraoperative signs of carcinoma such as adherence, invasion, enlarged nodes, or difficult dissection, because oncologic principles and margin status drive outcomes in suspected ACC [^3ad4b6a0] [^b08e8366] [^7220cece].

> Let me consider robotic assistance briefly. Robotic adrenalectomy may offer ergonomic advantages for large tumors and in obesity, but evidence is limited, costs are higher, and operative times are often longer. Given the lack of clear outcome benefits, I should reserve robotics for situations where it meaningfully facilitates dissection in my hands rather than defaulting to it solely for size or BMI [^7a204a8f] [^a727355f].

> I should double-check learning-curve and referral considerations. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy has a meaningful learning curve, and outcomes improve with experience. If I do not regularly perform adrenal surgery, referral to a high-volume center is prudent to minimize complications and conversion risk, especially for larger tumors where technical demands are higher [^a5e1b6ff] [^d1383d06].

> Putting this together, my preferred approach is a minimally invasive lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy on the left side, because the 7 cm size and BMI of 38 kg/m² both favor the lateral transabdominal route for working space and exposure, there is no prior abdominal surgery pushing me retroperitoneally, and there are no signs of invasion requiring an open operation. I will plan for standard port placement and maintain a low threshold to convert if malignancy is suspected intraoperatively [^8c96c6a6] [^547ccc3c] [^3ad4b6a0].

The preferred approach for a 7 cm left adrenal mass in a morbidly obese patient without prior abdominal surgery is a **minimally invasive lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy** [^8c96c6a6], as it provides superior visualization and working space for large tumors and in obesity [^547ccc3c]. This approach is supported by SAGES guidance to prefer the lateral transabdominal approach for large tumors (> 6 cm) and morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/m²) [^8c96c6a6] [^f1cbcbf0]. Robotic assistance may be considered if available and within resource constraints, but standard laparoscopy remains the reference approach [^7a204a8f] [^a727355f]. Open surgery is reserved for suspected or proven malignancy with local invasion or when minimally invasive techniques are not feasible [^7220cece] [^5f13d2e7].

---

## Indications for surgery

Surgery is indicated for the following reasons:

- **Tumor size**: Masses ≥ 4 cm have an increased risk of malignancy, and larger sizes further elevate concern [^b05aab10] [^0e92d490].

- **Hormonal activity**: Although this patient's hormonal workup is negative, large nonfunctioning masses may still harbor malignant potential [^b05aab10].

- **Patient preference**: Given the patient's symptoms and anxiety, surgical excision is reasonable after counseling [^notfound].

---

## Surgical approaches

Several surgical approaches are available for adrenalectomy, including:

| **Approach** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lateral transabdominal laparoscopic | - Large tumors (> 6 cm) <br/> - Morbidly obese patients <br/> - No prior abdominal surgery | - Excellent visualization <br/> - Ample working space <br/> - Familiar anatomy | - Longer operative time <br/> - Potential for intra-abdominal adhesions |
| Posterior retroperitoneoscopic | - Bilateral adrenalectomies <br/> - Prior abdominal surgery | - Avoids intra-abdominal cavity <br/> - Shorter operative time <br/> - Less postoperative pain | - Limited working space <br/> - Difficult for large tumors |
| Robotic-assisted laparoscopic | - Large tumors <br/> - Morbidly obese patients | - Enhanced dexterity <br/> - 3D visualization <br/> - Reduced blood loss | - Increased cost <br/> - Longer operative time <br/> - Limited availability |
| Open adrenalectomy | - Suspected malignancy <br/> - Local invasion <br/> - Difficult anatomy | - Direct visualization <br/> - En bloc resection | - Larger incision <br/> - Longer recovery <br/> - Higher morbidity |

---

## SAGES recommendations

SAGES provides specific guidance on the choice of surgical approach:

- **Large tumors (> 6 cm)**: Prefer lateral transabdominal approach due to increased feasibility and working space [^8c96c6a6] [^f1cbcbf0].

- **Morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/m²)**: Prefer lateral transabdominal approach for improved visualization and ergonomics [^8c96c6a6] [^f1cbcbf0].

- **Surgeon expertise**: Choose the approach with which the surgeon is most experienced and achieves the best outcomes [^3ac74bc9] [^d7a97019].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing approach selection

In this patient, the following factors influence the choice of approach:

- **Tumor size**: 7 cm, favoring lateral transabdominal approach [^8c96c6a6].

- **BMI**: 38 kg/m², favoring lateral transabdominal approach [^8c96c6a6].

- **Prior abdominal surgery**: None, making lateral transabdominal approach feasible [^8c96c6a6].

- **Hormonal status**: Nonfunctioning, allowing for standard laparoscopic approach without special perioperative considerations [^notfound].

---

## Recommended surgical approach

Given the patient's tumor size, BMI, and lack of prior abdominal surgery, the **preferred approach is a minimally invasive lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy**. This approach provides optimal visualization, working space, and ergonomic advantages for large tumors in morbidly obese patients [^547ccc3c]. Robotic assistance may be considered if available and within resource constraints, but standard laparoscopy remains the reference approach [^7a204a8f] [^a727355f].

---

## Intraoperative considerations

During surgery, the following considerations are important:

- **Patient positioning**: Lateral decubitus position with appropriate padding and support [^547ccc3c].

- **Port placement**: Standard four-port configuration with careful attention to ergonomics [^547ccc3c].

- **Adrenal vein control**: Early identification and ligation of the adrenal vein to minimize blood loss [^notfound].

- **Tumor handling**: Gentle manipulation to avoid capsular rupture and potential seeding [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative considerations

Postoperatively, the patient should be monitored for:

- **Pain control**: Multimodal analgesia regimen [^notfound].

- **Early mobilization**: To reduce risk of thromboembolic complications [^notfound].

- **Hormonal assessment**: Although the preoperative workup was negative, postoperative reassessment is prudent [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The preferred surgical approach for a 7 cm left adrenal mass in a morbidly obese patient without prior abdominal surgery is a **minimally invasive lateral transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy**. This approach aligns with SAGES recommendations and offers the best balance of safety, feasibility, and outcomes for this clinical scenario [^8c96c6a6] [^9fa3a3a4].

Diagnosis of PheochromocytomaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this study is to develop better methods of diagnosis, localization, and treatment for pheochromocytomas. These tumors, which usually arise from the adrenal glands, are often difficult to detect with current methods. Pheochromocytomas release chemicals called catecholamines, causing high blood pressure. Undetected, the tumors can lead to severe medical consequences, including stroke, heart attack and sudden death, in situations that would normally pose little or no risk, such as surgery, general anesthesia or childbirth. Patients with pheochromocytoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Study participants will undergo blood, urine, and imaging tests, described below, to detect pheochromocytoma. If a tumor is found, the patient will be offered surgery.

If surgery is not feasible, evaluations will continue in follow-up visits. If the tumor cannot be found, the patient will be offered medical treatment and efforts to detect the tumor will continue. Main diagnostic and research tests may include the following:

- Blood tests
- mainly measurements of plasma or urine catecholamines and metanephrines as well as methoxytyramine. If necessary the clonidine suppression test can be carried out.
- Standard imaging tests
- Non-investigational imaging tests include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonography, and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and FDG PET/CT. These scans may be done before and/or after surgical removal of pheochromocytoma. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies.

Large adrenal masses — laparoscopic adrenalectomy considerations include that the question on how to approach large adrenal tumors (> 5–6 cm) with no preoperative (or intraoperative) evidence of malignancy is a dilemma to the surgeon; tumor size ≥ 7.5 cm has been shown to be an independent risk factor for longer operating times, more blood loss, longer hospital stay, and a higher conversion rate to open surgery; and a shorter length of operating room time has been reported in tumors ≤ 5 cm compared with tumors > 5 cm. Recommendations specify that large adrenal tumors without pre- or intraoperative evidence of primary adrenal cortical carcinoma can be approached laparoscopically by a surgeon skilled in advanced laparoscopy and adrenal surgery (+, weak); laparoscopic adrenalectomy for larger tumors may be associated with increased operating room times, blood loss, and conversion rate to open surgery (+, weak); and if there is any evidence for carcinoma found intraoperatively, conversion to an open approach is warranted (should be strongly considered) (+, strong).

### Radiologic evaluation of incidentally discovered adrenal masses… [^449becbb]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Imaging to Determine Malignancy Most incidentally detected adrenal masses greater than 1 cm are characterized as benign, lipid-rich adenomas using the unenhanced phase of adrenal protocol CT. For masses that do not fit into this category, further contrast-enhanced and delayed-phase CT with washout calculations can be performed as part of the same examination. For patients who are unable to undergo a contrast-enhanced CT because of renal insufficiency or allergy to iodinated contrast media, chemical shift MRI can be performed. CT and MRI demonstrate similar accuracy in the diagnosis of adrenal masses. 18, 19 Cost and availability determine which is used as the primary modality in individual centers. Fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography can be used for lesions that cannot be categorized by CT or MRI. If the lesion still cannot be characterized, biopsy or surgical removal may be indicated.

The tracer m-iodobenzylguanidine localizes to adrenergic nerve endings, and studies using MIBG are useful in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma. CT The Hounsfield unit scale is a semiquantitative method of measuring radiography attenuation. Organs and tissues demonstrate variable attenuation depending on their density. Fat- and lipid-containing lesions have lower densities than the spleen, normal adrenal gland, or parenchyma of the liver. If an adrenal mass measures 10 HU or less on unenhanced CT, it is probably a lipid-rich adenoma. 14 The mean Hounsfield unit for adrenal carcinoma, metastasis, and pheochromocytoma is significantly higher. 20 A threshold value of 10 HU has a 71 percent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity for identifying adenomas and is generally accepted as a cutoff for diagnosis of lipid-rich adenomas. 21, 22. MRI Chemical shift MRI uses a technique based on hydrogen and fat protons, which resonate at different frequencies.

By using different time parameters during the same MRI examination, it is possible to identify lipid-rich adenomas. These adenomas show signal loss on out-of-phase imaging, as opposed to imaging when the protons are in phase. In contrast, nonadenomas do not show signal loss on out-of-phase imaging. 23, 24 Recent studies have shown that 60 to 89 percent of lesions measuring between 10 and 30 HU on unenhanced CT can be characterized using chemical shift MRI. 23, 25. FDG-PET Evaluation using FDG-PET has a high sensitivity for detecting malignancy 26; however, adenomas can also occasionally take up the radiotracer, decreasing the test's specificity. Therefore, FDG-PET is used to determine the need for biopsy in masses that cannot be characterized on CT or MRI. ADRENAL BIOPSY TO DETECT MALIGNANCY The role of adrenal biopsy has evolved.

Biopsy is not performed to diagnose adrenal adenoma, but mostly to confirm or rule out malignancy in the few cases in which CT or MRI results are equivocal. However, before adrenal biopsy is performed, pheochromocytoma should be excluded with biochemical tests, especially in an incidentally detected mass, because hemorrhage and hypertensive crisis have been reported as complications of pheochromocytomas biopsy. 27, 28. Is the Lesion Functioning or Nonfunctioning. Subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal nodules are well recognized; pheochromocytomas, aldosteronomas, and cortisol-secreting nodules are the most common. 13, 29 Although the literature yields variable results, the incidence of subclinical hyperfunctioning adrenal lesions is between 0. 4 and 15 percent. In one study, 19 of 33 adrenal pheochromocytomas were detected incidentally, and only 10 of the 19 patients were hypertensive.

Partial adrenalectomy — Studies reporting long-term outcomes after partial adrenalectomy have showed steroid-free outcomes in up to 91% of patients, and there is general agreement that the location of the tumor within the gland is the main determinant of the ease and ability to perform a partial adrenalectomy, with tumors anterior to and on the margin of the gland generally more amenable to partial removal than those on the posterior surface. In the laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy literature, the reported amount of adrenal cortical tissue needed to preserve adrenal function is 1/3 of one gland or 15% of total adrenal cortical tissue.

Partial adrenalectomy — Technique notes and recommendation: During preparation of the remnant, tumors should be resected with a 0.5–1 cm margin of normal adrenal tissue, the preserved adrenal cortex should not be mobilized out of the retroperitoneum, preservation of the adrenal vein is not essential, liberal use of laparoscopic ultrasound is advised, and extracapsular dissection with capsule preservation and surrounding fat resection is generally recommended except in partial adrenalectomies. Partial adrenalectomy is stated to be safe and feasible; for patients requiring bilateral adrenalectomy (e.g., hereditary pheochromocytomas), laparoscopic cortical sparing surgery "may be the procedure of choice (++, weak)", and additional evidence is needed before recommending partial adrenalectomy for single-gland, non-hereditary tumors.

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy evidence base — limitations include study design and reporting constraints: The available literature in laparoscopic adrenalectomy has several limitations, with few small controlled trials, mostly retrospective studies with significant heterogeneity and increased risk for publication bias and other confounding factors. Reporting of outcomes varies significantly and follow-up generally tends to be short, making it difficult to combine and compare data. Many studies lack details on surgeon expertise and are conducted in a single institution, limiting generalization; based on these limitations, firm recommendations are difficult.

Single port adrenalectomy — Published non-randomized series comparing conventional laparoscopic approaches and single port adrenalectomy have demonstrated no significant differences in patient length of stay or morbidity and a small benefit in cosmesis and postoperative pain but longer operative times with single port laparoscopy. From a technical standpoint, a transabdominal single port adrenalectomy requires a 2–3 cm incision for a multiport device, and for right adrenalectomies, an additional 2 mm needlescopic port is needed for liver retraction. Recommendation: Based on the available evidence, single port adrenalectomy is feasible and safe when undertaken by an experienced surgeon but offers little if any advantage over other standard laparoscopic approaches to adrenalectomy. Additional, better quality evidence is needed before this approach can be recommended (+, weak).

Pheochromocytoma — operative technical considerations highlight that compared with other indications for adrenalectomy, both laparoscopic and open resection of pheochromocytomas has been associated with longer operative times, higher complication rates, greater blood loss and longer hospitalization in some selected series, that generous use of clips in addition to vessel sealing technology is advisable for reliable hemostasis with careful identification and protection of the renal vessels, and that conversion to an open procedure is warranted when laparoscopic dissection cannot be performed safely or a complete resection cannot be performed without undue trauma to the gland; in this setting, intraoperative findings of tumor invasion into adjacent structures should guide the decision since radiographic and histological information, including intraoperative frozen section examination, are unreliable predictors of malignancy.

Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) — Approach selection and conversion: Evidence comparing laparoscopic and open adrenalectomy for ACC is limited; open advocates cite higher rates of local and peritoneal recurrence, shorter time to recurrence, and higher positive margin rates in laparoscopic groups, while others argue that for stage I and II ACC in high-volume centers adhering to oncologic principles, outcomes can be similar. Many surgeons start laparoscopically for medium or large incidental tumors but convert when tumor adhesion, invasion, enlarged nodes, or difficult dissection are encountered. The recommendation emphasizes that the best determinant of outcomes is appropriate oncologic resection with en bloc resection and regional lymphadenectomy; thus an open approach may be best, and if laparoscopy is chosen, conversion to open is strongly recommended when difficult dissection, adhesion or invasion, or enlarged nodes are seen (++, strong).

Minimally invasive adrenalectomy — comparative outcomes and adoption — Most patients spend 1–2 nights in the hospital, with a few centers performing outpatient adrenalectomies in appropriately selected patients. Compared with open adrenalectomy, studies have shown improved postoperative pain, decreased morbidity, lower or equivalent operative blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return of bowel function and recovery, with no significant differences in mortality. Operating time is less clear, with some series reporting longer times for laparoscopy, others similar duration, and others shorter duration compared with the open approach. For pheochromocytoma, laparoscopy has been associated with lower estimated blood loss and postoperative length of stay, with operative duration, morbidity, mortality, and intraoperative hemodynamics generally similar, though some reports noted fewer episodes of intraoperative hypertension or hypotension when laparoscopy was used. In hyperaldosteronism, two retrospective studies reported significantly decreased morbidity and shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopic group. Overall, minimally invasive adrenalectomy is associated with less postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay, earlier recovery, and similar long-term outcomes compared with open surgery and has been established as the preferred approach to all non-primary adrenal cancer pathology (+++, strong).

Guideline for the use of laparoscopic ultrasound in adrenal surgery — indications and benefits: Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) has been used in adrenal surgery to help localize tumors, and although it is not necessary in most cases, it may add information helpful in tumor removal to identify the extent of the disease. LUS can be used to localize a gland, determine the invasion of tumors into adjacent organs, identify adrenal veins/arteries, and identify pathology in other organs. Complications are uncommon, but misidentification could lead to harm; benefits include identification of the adrenal gland when it is difficult to find in retroperitoneal adipose tissue, identification of adrenal vasculature, assessment of adjacent organs for invasion, and assessment of pathology in other organs.

Lateral retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (LPA) — utilization, indications, and technique are summarized: LPA is the most common technique used by the urologic surgeon for adrenalectomy and, similar to PRA, is advocated in patients with prior abdominal surgery; while tumor size is also an important consideration, it does not seem to be as important as in PRA; typically, the procedure has slightly longer operating times and requires more ports than LA or PRA but maintains the advantages of avoiding the peritoneal cavity as in PRA. Relevant technical details include positioning the patient in a 60–90 degree angle with tumor side up and flexing the table, and that 4–5 trocars are needed to complete the procedure on either side, with dissection facilitated by three key planes between peri-renal fat and anterior renal fascia, perirenal fat and posterior fascia, and between the adrenal gland and the upper pole of the kidney.

Recommendation: Compared with standard laparoscopic techniques, robotic adrenalectomy may offer advantages for large tumors and in morbidly obese patients (+, weak). However, given the increased cost, longer operative times, and lack of clear patient outcome benefits using this technique, additional higher quality evidence is needed before a firm recommendation can be provided.

Technical details specify a camera port at the umbilicus with three additional ports placed in various configurations, left-sided steps of elevating the transverse mesocolon, identifying the ligament of Treitz and the IMV, opening the posterior retroperitoneum lateral to the IMV, dissecting inferiorly to and elevating the pancreas to identify the left renal vein and follow it to the left adrenal vein, then after the vein is taken mobilizing the gland from inferior and medial to superior and lateral.

Lateral transabdominal adrenalectomy (LTA) — technique and key steps — LTA is the most common adrenalectomy technique used by the general surgeon and, compared with the retroperitoneal approach, provides greater working space that can be beneficial for very large tumors and morbidly obese patients; the lateral decubitus position affords excellent exposure because gravity pulls the abdominal contents outside the operating field. Patients are positioned at a 60–90 degree angle with tumor side up, and the table is flexed to maximally open the space between the tip of the 12th rib and the iliac crest, and the operation can usually be accomplished with 3 ports for left adrenalectomy and 4 ports for right adrenalectomy (the fourth port is used for liver retraction). Left-sided steps include taking down the splenic flexure of the colon, freeing splenic ligaments to mobilize the spleen and rotate it medially, dissecting in the avascular plane between the tail of the pancreas and kidney, and controlling/dividing the adrenal vein as it enters the left renal vein. Right-sided steps include mobilization of the right triangular ligament of the liver, a hockey stick incision between the retroperitoneal attachments of the right lobe of the liver and the lateral border of the inferior vena cava (IVC), dissection of the lateral edge of the IVC, and taking the right adrenal vein at the takeoff from the IVC, with superior retraction of the liver maintained by the assistant throughout the case to aid exposure of the right adrenal; mobilization of the gland follows a superior-lateral to medial-inferior progression unless surgeon preference is for taking the adrenal vein early, in which case an inferior to superior and medial to lateral mobilization of the gland is preferred.

Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) — advantages, limitations, and key steps are outlined: advocates cite advantages of direct access to the adrenal gland that avoids the intra-abdominal cavity, and because the prone position facilitates equal access to the right and left side, bilateral procedures performed by PRA do not require repositioning between sides; disadvantages include lack of access to the intra-abdominal cavity for evaluation, difficulty in removing large tumors, and increased difficulty with increasing BMI due to the large distance between the gland and the skin and decreased working space from the additional fatty tissue; comparative studies with other laparoscopic approaches have demonstrated a small yet significant benefit in pain medication requirement, time to oral intake, length of hospital stay, and overall convalescence for PRA. Relevant technical details include positioning with bent hip joints at a 90-degree angle and table flexion to open the space between the 12th rib and iliac crest, use of three trocars placed just under the 12th rib, insufflation of the retroperitoneal space with 20–30 mmHg of CO2 via a balloon trocar, identification of landmarks (superior pole of kidney, psoas majorous, and posterior surface of liver or spleen), and elevation with identification and ligation of the adrenal vein in a medial or inferomedial position with either clips or a hemostatic device followed by lateral dissection between the diaphragm and psoas with superior attachments divided last.

Because of the frequent use of computed tomography and other abdominal imaging modalities, clinicians more frequently see the incidentally discovered, clinically silent adrenal mass. Most adrenal incidentalomas should be evaluated for hormonal activity and assessed for their risk of malignancy. Adrenalectomy is indicated for hyperfunctioning tumors and for any potential primary malignant adrenal lesion. Nonfunctioning cortical adenomas < 4 to 5 cm in size should be followed clinically and radiographically. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been used increasingly as the preferred approach in patients who require surgical resection whereas open adrenalectomy is reserved for patients with large, malignant tumors. The indications for adrenalectomy in patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors should not be liberalized because of the laparoscopic approach.

Surgical Management of Adrenal Incidentaloma

Indications for unilateral adrenalectomy

The principle threat of a unilateral adrenal lesion, with indeterminate imaging characteristics, is an ACC. For ACC without metastases, surgery is the most important single therapeutic measure. Guidelines recommend that surgery for patients with ACC should be limited to referral centers and performed by surgeons with expertise in adrenal surgery (open and laparoscopic) and with a volume of more than 15 adrenalectomies per year (benign and malignant).

Patients with a functional unilateral adenoma, with clinically significant hormone excess, are offered unilateral adrenalectomy. Patients with a unilateral adrenal adenoma and ACS, are considered for surgery on an individual basis and after MDT discussion. Surgery is taken into consideration along with the patient's age, degree of cortisol excess, general health, comorbidities, and patient preference. In all patients, considered for surgery, ACTH-independent cortisol excess should be confirmed.

There is no absolute size for the recommendation of surgery in nonfunctioning adenomas. Due to the paucity of follow-up data on the natural history of large suspected benign AIs, and the realization that the larger the mass, the higher the incidence of malignancy, surgery may be considered in larger lesions (> 4 cm) even if imaging characteristics suggest a benign lesion. Any indeterminate nodule on imaging greater than 4 cm should be offered surgery.

Occasionally myelolipomas and adrenal cysts are removed if they get to a significant size and cause compressive symptoms. Adrenal metastases are resected if appropriate in the context of the underlying pathology. In general, patients are deemed suitable if the underlying extra-adrenal malignancy is controlled, the metastasis is isolated to the adrenal gland and the patient has an adequate performance status to justify aggressive treatment.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published April 21, 2021 Among adults, the prevalence of adrenal incidentaloma has increased with the growing use of and technological advances in imaging and with the aging of the population. Read the NEJM Clinical Practice here. Clinical Pearls Q: What is the etiology of most adrenal incidentalomas. A: Most adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctioning benign tumors; 75% are nonfunctioning cortical adenomas. However, there are important clinical consequences in a subset of these masses. For example, approximately 14% of adrenal incidentalomas are functional tumors that secrete excess cortisol, aldosterone, or both. Other masses with clinical significance are pheochromocytomas and primary adrenal cancers or metastases to the adrenal gland. Q: What diagnostic tests should be performed in all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma.

A: An overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be performed in all patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Guidelines recommend that all patients with adrenal incidentaloma undergo biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma because these tumors may be clinically silent. However, some investigators have suggested that biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma is not necessary in a patient who has a lipid-rich tumor with a computed tomography attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, because these tumors are rarely pheochromocytomas. Any patient with adrenal incidentaloma and hypertension or hypokalemia should be screened for primary hyperaldosteronism with measurement of the mid-morning plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. A: Tumor size and imaging features are key to determining the likelihood of cancer and guiding treatment.

Although many studies of the risks of cancer associated with tumor size are limited by small samples, retrospective design, and selection bias, data consistently support associations between tumors that are larger than 4 cm in greatest diameter and an increased risk of cancer among patients with a unilateral adrenal mass. The risk of adrenocortical carcinoma is less than 2% among patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm in diameter, 6% among those with tumors between 4 cm and 6 cm in diameter, and 25% or higher among those with tumors that are at least 6 cm in diameter. However, patient age is an important factor in estimating cancer risk; because benign incidentalomas are uncommon in patients younger than 40 years of age, cancer is a concern even with smaller tumors in this age group.

A: On CT imaging, features other than tumor size can help to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal incidentalomas, although the ultimate diagnosis is based on histologic findings or clinical follow-up. Irregular tumor margins, heterogeneity, necrosis, vascularity, and calcification are features that arouse suspicion for cancer. An attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less on unenhanced CT is consistent with a benign lesion; in a series of 1161 adrenal tumors with an attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, no malignant tumors were observed. Guidelines differ with respect to follow-up recommendations for nonfunctioning tumors that are smaller than 4 cm in diameter with attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, but the most recent guidelines recommend that no follow-up imaging is needed unless clinical manifestations develop.

Recognize that the likelihood of malignancy is still low. Prefer obtaining immediate additional imaging according to the center's expertise and availability in most cases. Obtain interval imaging in 6–12 months (non-contrast CT/MRI) if the tumor is still judged as an indeterminate mass and surgery is not performed.

Follow-up in patients without surgery

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends repeated imaging for up to 5 years for benign tumors. However, the more recent European guidelines do not recommend further imaging for benign, nonfunctioning lesions of less than 4 cm. Patients with adrenal lesions over 4cm or indeterminate lesions, who have not undergone surgery are recommended to have repeat imaging, either a noncontrast CT or MRI in 6 to 12 months, the optimal timing is at the discretion of the MDT and depends on the index of suspicion. Surgical resection is recommended if there is a 20% increase in size, in addition to at least a 5 mm increase in diameter over this period. Both adrenocortical cancers and metastases usually demonstrate rapid growth over months, in contrast to a benign adenoma. Further imaging should be undertaken, again at 6 to 12 months, if there is an increase in size, but not at the threshold for surgical intervention. For younger patients, MRI surveillance, rather than CT, is preferred due to lower radiation exposure. In elderly patients follow up with imaging, even with nodules over 4 cm might be favored over surgery, in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Patients are treated on an individual basis but it is acknowledged that many clinicians and patients would not feel comfortable following up a tumor over 4 cm on imaging, even if radiologically benign, in a young patient and surgery is often the preferred option.

Repeat hormonal testing is not advised in patients without evidence of hormone oversecretion on their initial assessment. It should only be considered if patients develop new clinical signs of adrenal hormone hypersecretion or worsening of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, or osteoporosis.

The risk of patients with ACS progressing to overt Cushing's syndrome is negligible; however, ACS is associated with numerous comorbidities. If patients with ACS do not undergo surgery initially, they should be annually reassessed for cortisol hypersecretion and potential worsening of comorbidities. If there is clinical or biochemical progression then patients can be re-evaluated for surgery.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^9fa3a3a4]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Adrenalectomy — operative approach and minimally invasive technique: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy has become accepted as the gold-standard approach for most small benign adrenal pathology because studies show decreased pain, shorter hospitalizations, and more rapid recovery compared with open adrenalectomy, although there have been no prospective randomized trials comparing laparoscopic to open adrenalectomy. Both laparoscopic transabdominal adrenalectomy and posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (PRA) are effective and safe; some studies suggest less pain and faster recovery after PRA and additional advantages in patients with extensive abdominal surgical history and/or bilateral tumors. When patient and tumor characteristics are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we recommend either a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach because of similar perioperative outcomes, with approach choice determined by surgeon expertise and tumor/patient characteristics (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Adrenocortical carcinoma is described as "a rare malignancy, often with poor outcomes". For any patient with an adrenal mass suspicious for adrenocortical carcinoma, "the approach should include prompt evaluation with detailed history and physical exam, imaging, and biochemical adrenal hormone assessment". It adds that "in addition to adrenal-focused imaging, patients should be evaluated with chest-abdomen-pelvis cross-sectional imaging to define the initial therapy plan". For potentially resectable disease limited to the adrenal gland, patients "should undergo en bloc open surgery by an expert surgeon". The review notes its approach is case-based and that "the provided recommendations are based on evidence available from randomized prospective clinical studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional and case-based studies, and expert opinions".

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^20e6b8a6]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Metastasis to the adrenal gland — evaluation and management state that adrenal metastases may have imaging features that make them potentially indistinguishable from other pathologies, and functional evaluation is imperative prior to biopsy, ablation, or resection and should aim, at a minimum, to exclude excess hormone production. If the indeterminate adrenal mass is the only site of potential metastatic disease and appears resectable in an otherwise fit operative candidate, surgical resection rather than biopsy may be considered for both diagnostic purposes and potential therapeutic benefit. We recommend that a directed hormonal evaluation should be performed in patients with an adrenal mass regardless of history of extra-adrenal malignancy. We suggest that in the setting of a radiographically indeterminate mass, image-guided biopsy be rarely performed and reserved for patients in whom results would change overall disease management and that it be performed only after confirming lack of hormone excess. We suggest that after multidisciplinary review, resection may be offered to highly selected patients to improve survival compared with systemic therapy alone.

Importance

Adrenalectomy is the definitive treatment for multiple adrenal abnormalities. Advances in technology and genomics and an improved understanding of adrenal pathophysiology have altered operative techniques and indications.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective approaches to adrenalectomy.

Evidence Review

A multidisciplinary panel identified and investigated 7 categories of relevant clinical concern to practicing surgeons. Questions were structured in the framework Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome, and a guided review of medical literature from PubMed and/or Embase from 1980 to 2021 was performed. Recommendations were developed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and were discussed until consensus, and patient advocacy representation was included.

Findings

Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger should undergo biochemical testing and further imaging characterization. Adrenal protocol computed tomography (CT) should be used to stratify malignancy risk and concern for pheochromocytoma. Routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule with benign imaging characteristics and unenhanced CT with Hounsfield units less than 10 is not suggested. When unilateral disease is present, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with primary aldosteronism or autonomous cortisol secretion. Patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to optimize outcomes, including, when possible, a complete R0 resection without tumor disruption, which may require en bloc radical resection. Selective or nonselective α blockade can be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. Empirical perioperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated for patients with overt Cushing syndrome, but for patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion, postoperative day 1 morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation testing can be used to determine the need for glucocorticoid replacement therapy. When patient and tumor variables are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy can be achieved either via a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach depending on surgeon expertise, as well as tumor and patient characteristics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Twenty-six clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations are provided to assist surgeons with perioperative adrenal care.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) — operative and systemic management emphasizes that adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer and complete surgical resection is the only potential curative therapy, and we recommend that patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with ACC should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to improve recurrence outcomes; data on overall survival are inconclusive. Regardless of operative approach, we recommend an en bloc radical resection with an intact capsule to microscopically negative (RO) margins because of improved survival, and although open resection is preferred when ACC is suspected, the choice of operative approach should be based on the certainty of a complete RO resection without tumor disruption. Approximately 22% to 35% of patients with ACC have evidence of metastatic disease at initial presentation, and we suggest that patients with systemic disease be offered resection of the primary tumor if all sites of disease are reasonably amenable to resection or local treatment and if performance status allows; surgery may also be considered in patients with hormone excess medically refractory to steroidogenic inhibition. We recommend that neoadjuvant systemic therapy be administered for advanced ACC when RO surgical resection is not initially feasible, and we recommend up-front surgical intervention when RO resection is possible.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) — limitations of the available literature — are noted to include a few single-center studies of limited quality with small patient cohorts that make generalizations difficult and allow institutional and personal biases; there is also a lack of uniformity and detail in reported selection criteria and noninvasive imaging prior to the procedure. These limitations and the high mortality rates of this patient population make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact of DL on patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness, and the impact of the surgeon's laparoscopic expertise on diagnostic accuracy is unknown.

Since the first description of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) for pheochromocytoma and Cushing syndrome in 1992, the utilization of and indications for a minimally invasive approach to the adrenal gland have vastly expanded. Although minimally invasive adrenalectomy has been established as the preferred approach for patients with benign tumors of the adrenal gland, minimally invasive adrenalectomy for cancer remains controversial. In this article, the authors review the indications for minimally invasive adrenalectomy for adrenal nodules suspicious for, or established to represent, a primary malignancy or a site of metastatic cancer.
