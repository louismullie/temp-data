## Question

How is chronic anemia determined?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine chronic anemia and wants a step-by-step approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to confirm the presence and chronicity of anemia using appropriate hemoglobin thresholds and repeat testing. Then, I should review the initial clinical evaluation, including history, exam, and baseline labs. Next, I will classify anemia by red cell indices and reticulocyte response to narrow the differential. After that, I need to interpret iron studies in the context of inflammation. Then, I will assess inflammatory activity and hepcidin-mediated mechanisms. Next, I should evaluate for specific chronic conditions such as CKD, IBD, malignancy, and heart failure. Finally, I will rule out coexisting etiologies and account for special populations like older adults, children, and high-altitude residents before synthesizing a diagnostic path forward.

> Let me first confirm the presence and chronicity of anemia; I need to ensure hemoglobin is below an appropriate threshold for age, sex, and context and that the low value is persistent over at least three months, because a single low result may reflect transient illness or laboratory variation rather than chronic anemia. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds I apply: WHO cutoffs are widely used but have recognized limitations and may not map cleanly to health outcomes; in older adults, evidence supports an Hb threshold of < 13.0 g/dL for both men and postmenopausal women, and altitude adjustments can be necessary to avoid misclassification in high-altitude populations, so I must adjust for these factors before labeling chronic anemia definitively [^112abv88] [^113a1ABe] [^116TEFLD].

> Next, I should review the initial clinical evaluation; wait, let me verify I capture key history clues such as duration of anemia, bleeding, diet, medications, comorbid inflammatory disease, CKD, malignancy, family history, and symptoms, and then examine for pallor, organomegaly, and bleeding stigmata to contextualize laboratory findings and guide targeted testing [^113hDmon] [^116116vp]. I need to check that baseline laboratory screening includes a CBC with indices and RDW, an absolute reticulocyte count to assess marrow response, and a peripheral smear, because these are foundational in distinguishing production failure from hemolysis or blood loss and are part of guideline-recommended initial workup in CKD as well [^116oqmLu] [^113hDmon].

> I will now classify anemia by MCV and reticulocyte response; but wait, what if the MCV is normal yet mixed processes exist, I should double-check RDW and smear for dual populations. Microcytosis points me toward iron deficiency, thalassemia traits, or iron-restricted erythropoiesis in inflammation, normocytosis is common in CKD and anemia of inflammation, and macrocytosis suggests B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia, so MCV narrows the differential but does not replace a reticulocyte index interpretation [^112AkgfE] [^117SGuKh] [^113hDmon]. Let me verify reticulocyte signaling: a high reticulocyte index suggests hemolysis or ongoing blood loss, whereas a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte response indicates impaired erythropoiesis typical of inflammation, CKD, marrow disorders, or nutritional deficiencies [^116116vp].

> Next, I should review iron studies and interpret them in the inflammatory milieu; I need to ensure I do not overcall iron sufficiency when ferritin is elevated as an acute phase reactant. Ferritin is reliable for deficiency when very low, but in inflammation ferritin may exceed 100 mcg/L despite iron-restricted erythropoiesis, making transferrin saturation (TSAT) and advanced markers crucial; TSAT < 20% supports insufficient iron delivery, and a low TSAT with normal or high ferritin is characteristic of anemia of inflammation, whereas soluble transferrin receptor and the sTfR/log ferritin index can help separate pure IDA from AI or mixed states, and in CKD the percentage of hypochromic cells or reticulocyte hemoglobin content improves detection of functional iron deficiency [^1132BBN1] [^117SGuKh] [^116ir8de] [^113bSGbB] [^117EMSCv]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; pathophysiologically, IL-6–induced hepcidin causes iron sequestration by downregulating ferroportin, so functional deficiency can coexist with adequate or increased stores, and hepcidin measurements, where available, may assist in differentiating AI from AI/IDA and guide therapy selection [^1114Y6P7] [^117SGuKh].

> I will now examine inflammatory status; wait, let me verify a broad assessment that includes clinical context and biomarkers such as CRP and ESR. Elevated CRP, and often ESR, supports an inflammatory anemia, and emerging clinical hepcidin assays can corroborate iron sequestration, while IL-6 is a key cytokine linking inflammation to hepcidin induction and marrow suppression, especially relevant in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis; however, I need to ensure I interpret these markers alongside iron indices to avoid misclassification [^113nmJsn] [^116hYeZK] [^116xxuaK] [^117SGuKh] [^116ir8de].

> Let me consider specific chronic conditions now; I should confirm or exclude CKD because anemia becomes prevalent as eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², more so below 30, and is typically normocytic and hypoproliferative from relative EPO deficiency compounded by inflammation and iron dysregulation, so I will check eGFR, review KDIGO-recommended initial labs, and consider relative EPO deficiency in the differential [^112AGZ78] [^117SGuKh] [^116oqmLu]. I should also evaluate for IBD, where ECCO criteria define AI when ferritin is > 100 mcg/L with TSAT < 20% in the setting of inflammation, and I must keep malignancy, heart failure, and HIV on my radar as they drive anemia via cytokine-mediated EPO resistance and iron restriction, necessitating disease-directed workup and management if suspected clinically [^1132BBN1] [^111o9XK7] [^111z2C6o] [^115zFEUA] [^116FvDEb].

> I need to ensure I rule out confounders and coexisting etiologies; true iron deficiency remains common from occult gastrointestinal blood loss or menorrhagia, so I should confirm with a low ferritin in the absence of inflammation and pursue GI evaluation when indicated, balancing best-practice guidance to identify sources of iron loss, including GI bleeding and malabsorption, especially in IBD or NSAID exposure [^111sFJG3] [^113ed3k8]. I should double-check for hemolysis with haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and Coombs testing, confirm or exclude B12 and folate deficiency, consider hemoglobinopathy screening when ancestry or indices suggest it, and, if cytopenias are unexplained or myelodysplasia is suspected, proceed to marrow evaluation; I initially used a reference that was incomplete, so let me correct and explicitly cite UK Kidney Association guidance for selective tests including hemolysis panels, hemoglobin electrophoresis, free light chains, and bone marrow examination, and rely on ASH and primary care approaches that emphasize smear and reticulocytes to trigger marrow evaluation when indicated [^112RQe65] [^116116vp] [^113hDmon] [^116oqmLu].

> But wait, what if the population context alters thresholds; I should verify special scenarios. In pediatrics with CKD, KDIGO uses age-specific Hb cutoffs to define anemia, which differ from adult thresholds, requiring age-appropriate interpretation, and in older adults, using < 13 g/dL for both sexes better aligns with observed risk even at mild anemia levels, so I should recalibrate expectations accordingly [^1116VmVe] [^112abv88] [^113vHCGw]. In high-altitude populations, I need to adjust Hb thresholds because physiologic erythrocytosis can mask anemia or spuriously elevate classification if uncorrected, and recent analyses emphasize the risk of misclassification using unadjusted WHO cutoffs, so altitude-aware diagnostics are essential before labeling chronic anemia [^113a1ABe] [^116q5b2E].

> Let me synthesize and verify the diagnostic path; chronic anemia is best framed as persistent low hemoglobin confirmed on repeat testing over at least three months, followed by structured evaluation with CBC indices, reticulocyte count, smear, iron studies interpreted with inflammatory markers, and targeted workup for CKD, IBD, malignancy, heart failure, or HIV while excluding coexisting iron deficiency, hemolysis, B12/folate deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, and marrow failure, tailoring thresholds to age and altitude to avoid misclassification that delays definitive diagnosis and treatment [^113D8qwA] [^116oqmLu] [^117SGuKh] [^112AGZ78] [^1132BBN1]. Hold on, I should also confirm that I do not jump to treatment before addressing correctable causes; in CKD, for example, guidelines emphasize correcting iron deficiency and inflammation prior to ESAs, cautious ESA targets well below 13 g/dL, monitoring iron safety thresholds, and considering HIF-PHI in ESA hyporesponsiveness, which underscores why accurate phenotyping of anemia mechanisms up front is crucial to safe and effective management once the diagnosis of chronic anemia is established [^116oxpC2] [^114wzHmw] [^113TEwKM] [^116V9Nh1] [^112a4NQ3].

Chronic anemia results from a combination of **nutritional deficiencies** (iron, B12, folate) [^111sFJG3] [^115NRaXz], **chronic diseases** (CKD, heart failure, IBD, cancer) [^117SGuKh], and **inflammatory states** that drive hepcidin-mediated iron restriction and erythropoietin suppression [^117SGuKh] [^114BsmYh]. Additional contributors include **chronic blood loss**, hemolytic disorders, bone marrow failure, and genetic conditions such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia [^113Tx4eQ] [^112AkgfE]. Diagnosis relies on **CBC, iron studies**, and evaluation of underlying causes [^116oqmLu]; management focuses on correcting deficiencies, treating the primary disease, and using **ESAs or transfusions** when indicated [^116oxpC2] [^116Qxyrx].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

**Iron deficiency** is the most common cause globally, due to inadequate intake, malabsorption (e.g. IBD, gastrectomy), or chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, GI bleeding, hookworm) [^115NRaXz] [^111sFJG3]. **Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies** are common in older adults, causing macrocytic anemia from impaired DNA synthesis [^113hS5xH].

---

## Chronic diseases and inflammation

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced erythropoietin, inflammation, iron deficiency, and uremic toxins cause normocytic, normochromic anemia [^115y47Jv].

- **Heart failure**: Inflammation, renal dysfunction, and malabsorption contribute to anemia [^111pQ8zP] [^115zFEUA].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease are frequent [^113bSGbB] [^1132BBN1].

- **Cancer**: Cytokine-mediated erythropoietin suppression and iron sequestration cause anemia [^111z2C6o].

- **Chronic inflammation**: IL-6–driven hepcidin increases iron sequestration and suppresses erythropoiesis [^116ir8de] [^114BsmYh].

---

## Chronic blood loss

**Gastrointestinal bleeding** from peptic ulcers, malignancies, and varices, and **gynecologic bleeding** due to menorrhagia and uterine fibroids are common sources of chronic blood loss [^111sFJG3] [^113ed3k8].

---

## Hemolytic disorders

**Sickle cell disease** causes chronic hemolysis from abnormal hemoglobin [^113Tx4eQ] [^115XnfEq], and **thalassemia** results from genetic defects in globin synthesis, leading to chronic hemolysis.

---

## Bone marrow failure syndromes

**Aplastic anemia** involves marrow failure that reduces erythropoiesis, whereas **myelodysplastic syndromes** feature ineffective erythropoiesis due to clonal marrow disorders [^113hS5xH] [^116116vp].

---

## Genetic factors

**Hemoglobinopathies** such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia cause chronic anemia [^113Tx4eQ] [^112AkgfE], while **enzyme deficiencies** like G6PD deficiency cause hemolytic anemia.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **CBC**: Assess hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and reticulocyte count [^116oqmLu].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and TIBC [^117EMSCv].

- **Vitamin levels**: Serum B12 and folate [^116oqmLu].

- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP and ESR [^117SGuKh].

- **Additional tests**: Hemolysis markers, hemoglobin electrophoresis [^112RQe65], and bone marrow biopsy as indicated [^116oqmLu] [^112RQe65].

---

## Management strategies

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and inflammation [^112ekgeq].

- **Iron supplementation**: Oral or intravenous iron as indicated [^113ed3k8] [^116V9Nh1].

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: For CKD and other chronic diseases [^1148K2kY] [^116oxpC2] [^113rGhTA].

- **Blood transfusions**: For severe anemia or acute exacerbations [^116Qxyrx].

---

Chronic anemia results from nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, inflammation, chronic blood loss, hemolytic disorders, bone marrow failure, and genetic factors. **Accurate diagnosis** and **targeted management** are essential to improve outcomes [^115BrY5w].

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, leading to hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function result in impaired gas exchange, causing tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia, defined as the deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues, is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies and is often multifactorial in its causes. Chronic hypoxia in these patients often signifies disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is crucial to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications.

In this article, we discuss the management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to:

- **Understanding of the disease pathophysiology**: Demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination.
- **Explore diagnostic pathways**: Discuss various approaches to diagnosis.
- **Review the management**: Provide insights into effective treatment strategies.

### The role of iron in chronic inflammatory diseases: From mechanisms to treatment options in anemia of inflammation [^114BsmYh]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI) is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients affected by chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer, that negatively affect disease outcome and quality of life. The pathophysiology of AI is multifactorial, with inflammatory hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis playing a major role in the context of disease-specific factors. Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to iron dysregulation in AI, the impact of hypoferremia and anemia on the course of the underlying disease, and novel therapeutic strategies applied to treat AI.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in patients with diseases that cause prolonged immune activation, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list has grown to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity. Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis. In addition, shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern. Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, the diagnosis of AI patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more difficult. In addition to treatment of the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in many patients. In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may offer additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, finding the appropriate indications for these specific treatments remains challenging.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^115y47Jv]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as kidney disease progresses.

- **Pathophysiology**: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO) production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.

- **Disease course**: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48–5.26).

### Sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sickle cell disease:

- **Definition**: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and end-organ damage.

- **Pathophysiology**: SCD is caused by a mutation in the sixth amino acid of the β-globin gene. Polymerization of abnormal hemoglobin leads to vascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia, which precipitate a cascade of pathologic events leading to vascular-endothelial dysfunction, functional nitric oxide deficiency, hypercoagulability, increased neutrophil adhesiveness, and platelet activation.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of SCD is estimated at 30 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: CNS injury is the most debilitating frequent complication of SCD and includes stroke, silent cerebral infarct, and cognitive impairment. SCD causes vasculopathy (pulmonary hypertension, priapism, and retinopathy) and progressive ischemic organ failure (renal failure, hyposplenism, liver damage, bone disease).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, the median age at death is 42 years for females and 38 years for males. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment, but it is not feasible for the vast majority of patients suffering from the disease.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116V9Nh1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, and more specifically with respect to iron therapy, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring iron status every 1–3 months in patients receiving IV iron to avoid toxicity, indicated by a serum ferritin of > 800 mcg/L or transferrin saturation > 40%. View serum ferritin consistently > 800 mcg/L with no evidence of inflammation (normal CRP) as suggestive of iron overload. (1B).

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^116q5b2E]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Limitations of global standards for anemia diagnosis and outdated definitions represent significant challenges in estimating the burden of anemia. The thresholds commonly used for defining anemia are largely arbitrary. For instance, the thresholds recommended by the WHO were originally based on hemoglobin (Hb) distributions observed in limited populations from Western countries such as Europe, the United States, and Canada in the 1960s. These thresholds were not derived from direct associations with health outcomes. While revising these thresholds might seem straightforward, accurately defining anemia remains highly complex due to recognized differences in biological, geographical, and geopolitical factors, compounded by challenges related to measurement methods, test validity, and accessibility.

Hemoglobin concentration cutoffs established by the WHO for anemia diagnosis (13.0 g/dL for men aged 15 years and older, 11.0 g/dL for children, and 12.0 g/dL for nonpregnant women) may not reflect functional outcomes or clinical practice. Additionally, these cutoffs do not appear to be linked with physiological, health, or other relevant outcomes. A cross-sectional study involving 79,950 hemoglobin observations from 30 global nutrition surveys conducted between 2005 and 2016 across 25 countries indicated that WHO cutoffs are higher than the fifth percentile in most countries, except the United States. This pattern was noted in 13,445 children aged 6–59 months and 25,880 nonpregnant women aged 15–49 years. Elevated levels of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), a biomarker, were also observed.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Normocytic anemia [^113hDmon]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem often discovered through routine laboratory tests, with its prevalence increasing with age; it reaches 44 percent in men older than 85 years. Normocytic anemia is the most frequently encountered type of anemia. Anemia of chronic disease, the most common normocytic anemia, is found in 6 percent of adult patients hospitalized by family physicians. The goals of evaluation and management are to make an accurate and efficient diagnosis, avoid unnecessary testing, correct underlying treatable causes, and ameliorate symptoms when necessary.

The evaluation begins with a thorough history and a careful physical examination. Basic diagnostic studies include red blood cell distribution width, corrected reticulocyte index, and peripheral blood smear; further testing is guided by these study results. Treatment should focus on correcting the underlying cause of anemia. A recent advance in treatment is the use of recombinant human erythropoietin.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically during the initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating all patients with chronic anemia associated with CKD. This evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment if hemoglobin levels are less than 110 g/L (or less than 105 g/L in patients under 2 years old) or if symptoms are attributable to anemia, regardless of the grade of kidney disease or the requirement for RRT.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^116YXhHM]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene, resulting in the loss of function of collagen VII anchoring fibrils. This structural defect leads to severe skin and mucosal fragility, causing patients to suffer repetitive cutaneous wounds and mucosal damage. These lesions cause blood loss, persistent inflammation, infection risk, iron deficiency (ID), and, ultimately, anemia, which further exacerbates the overall disease burden.

Inflammation induces hypoferremia as an innate defense mechanism to restrict iron availability to pathogens. Although this strategy limits microbial growth, it simultaneously impairs erythropoiesis by reducing iron availability for red blood cell production. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines exert a direct negative effect on red blood cell production. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) skews hematopoiesis toward myelopoiesis, prioritizing the production of immune cells over erythrocytes to meet the increased demand for host defense. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) contributes to this shift by directly inhibiting the differentiation and survival of erythroid progenitors, whereas interferon-γ (IFN-γ) shortens erythrocyte life span, further compromising erythroid output. The sustained activation of these mechanisms ultimately leads to anemia of inflammation (AI), also referred to as anemia of chronic disease. AI is associated with highly prevalent conditions including cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases, and other inflammatory disorders.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^116TEFLD]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Several fundamental unknowns remain in our collective understanding of anaemia; many researchers worldwide are working on these problems, and that focus must be sustained. First and foremost, we do not truly know what the ideal definition of anaemia should be. Although many health conditions are defined on the basis of empirical assessments of increased rates of poor health outcomes (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease) or statistical deviations in representative populations (e.g. childhood growth standards), WHO anaemia definitions do not have a similar rigorous clinical basis. Evidence-based definitions of anaemia according to health loss associated with low haemoglobin concentrations are urgently needed to guide updated burden assessments, clinical standards, and subsequent prioritisation of this public health problem.

Work from the BRINDA team suggests that existing formulae for altitude adjustment could lead to underestimation of anaemia at lower altitudes (3000 m), with differences in total anaemia prevalence ranging from three to 22 percentage points in the locations studied. Second, methods of haemoglobin sampling (e.g. whole vs capillary blood) and analysis (e.g. laboratory vs point-of-care testing) vary considerably. The effect of this heterogeneity on estimates of anaemia burden and trends requires further exploration, as some evaluations have suggested up to a 28% variation between sampling methods.

Finally, although we assess the direct disability burden of anaemia in the form of years lived with disability (YLDs), this measure…

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^116oqmLu]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning the initial evaluation, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests as part of the initial evaluation of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of age and CKD stage:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Gather baseline information on blood components.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: Assess bone marrow response.

- **Serum ferritin level**: Evaluate iron stores.

- **Serum transferrin saturation**: Determine iron availability for erythropoiesis.

- **Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels**: Check for vitamin deficiencies that may contribute to anemia.

### Anemia and risk for cognitive decline in chronic kidney disease [^1122E5JZ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its health consequences are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between anemia and cognitive decline in older adults with CKD.

- **Methods**: We studied a subgroup of 762 adults aged ≥ 55 years with CKD participating in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women). Cognitive function was assessed annually with a battery of six tests. We used logistic regression to determine the association between anemia and baseline cognitive impairment on each test, defined as a cognitive score more than one standard deviation from the mean. Mixed effects models were employed to determine the relation between anemia and changes in cognitive function during follow-up after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Of 762 participants with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 42.7 ± 16.4 ml/min/1.73 m², 349 (46%) had anemia. Anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive impairment on any test after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Over a median of 2.9 (IQR 2.6–3.0) years of follow-up, there was no independent association between anemia and changes in cognitive function on any of the six cognitive tests.

- **Conclusions**: Among older adults with CKD, anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive function or cognitive decline.

Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but its health consequences are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between anemia and cognitive decline in older adults with CKD.

- **Methods**: We studied a subgroup of 762 adults aged ≥ 55 years with CKD participating in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. Anemia was defined according to World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women). Cognitive function was assessed annually with a battery of six tests. We used logistic regression to determine the association between anemia and baseline cognitive impairment on each test, defined as a cognitive score more than one standard deviation from the mean, and mixed effects models to determine the relation between anemia and change in cognitive function during follow-up after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Of 762 participants with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 42.7 ± 16.4 ml/min/1.73 m², 349 (46%) had anemia. Anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive impairment on any test after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Over a median of 2.9 (IQR 2.6–3.0) years of follow-up, there was no independent association between anemia and change in cognitive function on any of the six cognitive tests.

- **Conclusions**: Among older adults with CKD, anemia was not independently associated with baseline cognitive function or decline.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend individualizing therapy. Some patients may experience improvements in quality of life (QoL) at hemoglobin concentrations greater than 11.5 g/dL and may be prepared to accept the associated risks.

### Dysregulated monocyte iron homeostasis and erythropoietin formation in patients with anemia of chronic disease [^116Dx4pR]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is frequently found in patients with chronic immune activation. Since most studies on ACD pathophysiology were performed with cell culture or animal models, but not in humans, we examined 37 ACD patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or infections, 10 subjects with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), 10 anemic patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), and 27 age-matched controls. Although hemoglobin concentrations were comparable between ACD and IDA patients, the latter presented with significantly higher serum erythropoietin concentrations than ACD patients. The significant negative correlation between erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels observed in IDA patients was also found in a group of anemic but not hypoferremic hereditary spherocytosis subjects, but not in ACD patients. Increased serum concentrations of the hepcidin precursor prohepcidin were paralleled by a decreased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin in circulating monocytes of ACD patients. In the latter cells, increased amounts of the iron storage protein ferritin and a reduced activity of iron-regulatory protein indicated monocyte iron accumulation. Our data indicate that hypoferremia in ACD may result from downregulation of ferroportin expression by hepcidin and cytokines with subsequent iron retention in monocytes. Together with a diminished erythropoietin formation, the impaired iron recirculation from monocytes may be central in the pathophysiology of ACD in humans.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^116rH9yg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common feature of CKD associated with poor outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is controversial, with recent clinical trials demonstrating increased morbidity and mortality related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Here, we examine recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD. These insights hold promise for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies that directly target the pathophysiologic processes underlying this form of anemia.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to indications for screening, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend measuring hemoglobin concentration in patients with CKD who do not have anemia when clinically indicated. The frequency of these measurements is based on the stage of CKD:

- **Stage 3**: Once per year
- **Stage 4–5, non-dialysis**: Twice per year
- **Stage 5, on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis**: Every 3 months.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^114RqVtL]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Inflammatory signals and the restriction in iron availability impair erythropoiesis, contributing to the development of anemia of inflammation (AI). In response to hypoxia, erythropoietin (EPO) secretion increases, which promotes tissue repair and the expansion of erythroblasts while attenuating inflammatory signaling. Erythroblasts secrete erythroferrone (ERFE), which disrupts bone morphogenetic protein signaling, reducing hepcidin secretion by hepatocytes and thereby allowing iron release to support erythropoiesis. However, chronic inflammatory signals can unbalance this homeostatic loop by suppressing EPO production and its downstream signaling.

Thus, in chronic pathologies, this dysregulation causes inflammatory iron restriction to progress into absolute iron deficiency (ID), making it common for AI to coexist with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Under conditions of ID, the production of EPO in response to hypoxia is further diminished as the body attempts to conserve limited iron resources for essential functions beyond erythropoiesis. This suppression impairs the maturation of red blood cells, thereby complicating the restoration of hemoglobin levels when AI and IDA occur simultaneously.

Iron deficiency and inflammation are considered the main contributors to anemia in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), yet the role of specific mediators and the reasons behind the limited efficacy of therapies remain incompletely understood. In RDEB, continuous wounding leads to unrelenting inflammation that complicates anemia recovery. However, because of the constant risk of infection, anti-inflammatory drugs are not the first line of treatment for RDEB. This situation underscores the complexities involved in managing anemia in this condition.

### Anemia in early rheumatoid arthritis is associated with interleukin 6-mediated bone marrow suppression, but has no effect on disease course or mortality [^116hYeZK]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is the most common extraarticular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but there is limited information on the cause and consequences of ACD. We investigated the prevalence, relation with proinflammatory cytokines, and effect on disease outcome of ACD in patients with RA.

- **Methods**: The presence of anemia was analyzed in a cohort of 111 consecutive patients with early RA. Anemia was related to markers of erythropoiesis and inflammation, clinically and by levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The frequency of various disease outcomes during the mean follow-up of 74 months was compared between ACD and nonanemic patients.

- **Results**: ACD was present in 25% of patients during the first year of disease. ACD was associated with higher CRP (45 vs 22 g/l; p = 0.04) and ESR levels (54 vs 33 mm/h; p = 0.002). Hemoglobin levels were inversely correlated with serum erythropoietin (p = 0.003) in univariate analysis, but in multivariate analysis only ESR (p = 0.005) and IL-6 (p = 0.056) remained as independent predictors of hemoglobin levels. Presence of ACD was not associated with later development of disease manifestations or mortality.

- **Conclusion**: While ACD affected 25% of patients with RA early in the disease course, this had no influence on disease outcome, including mortality during the following six years. The association between IL-6 and ACD suggests that IL-6-mediated bone marrow suppression is the main mechanism for development.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, with particular focus on iron therapy (upper limit), UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend not allowing serum ferritin to exceed 600 mcg/L in patients not on hemodialysis who are treated with iron. It is advised to review iron management when ferritin is ≥ 500 mcg/L, recognizing that levels > 800 mcg/L may indicate iron toxicity.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: Etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^112abv88]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Anemia is prevalent in men and women over the age of 65 years and becomes progressively more common with age. It is associated with reductions in functional capacity and quality of life, as well as an increased risk of death from all causes. Roughly one-third of anemia cases in older patients is unexplained (UAA). Although the WHO diagnostic thresholds for anemia are most frequently used, evidence supports the use of a single criterion of Hb < 13 g/dl in both older men and postmenopausal women.

Even mild anemia (Hb 11.0–12.9) is associated with poor clinical outcomes, lower quality of life (QOL), and elevated mortality.

- **Diagnosis**: UAA is currently diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable causes for anemia. However, the diagnostic criteria for UAA are clearly defined, and the UAA patient population experiences significant functional decline, morbidity, and mortality.
- **Treatment limitations**: Due to the lack of consensus on the etiology of UAA, treatment options are extremely limited at present. Novel therapies are currently in development for the treatment of this highly prevalent condition.

Finally, we strongly recommend routine assessment of functional capacity and quality of life in all older patients by healthcare providers. This is particularly important for those suffering from anemia, using standardized tools that will help to identify functional deficits and changes in functional capacity in older patients with anemia.

### The role of inflammation in the anaemia of end-stage renal disease [^111HmdZK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic inflammation is a common feature of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that is gaining increasing attention as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is well established that ESRD itself carries a heightened risk of inflammatory disorders and other co-morbid conditions. However, it should also be noted that dialysis treatment can introduce additional risk factors for inflammation, such as impure dialysate or bio-incompatible membranes.

Recently, inflammation has been associated with atherosclerosis and malnutrition in ESRD, leading to the development of the malnutrition, inflammation, atherosclerosis (MIA) hypothesis. This hypothesis describes a syndrome where raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, are a common link between malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, anaemia appears to be an important element linking elevated cytokine levels with poor patient outcomes.

Several mechanisms for cytokine-induced anaemia have been proposed, including intestinal bleeding, impaired iron metabolism, and suppression of bone marrow erythropoiesis and erythropoietin production. These effects suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines may also be a significant cause of a lack of response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-Epo) therapy. In light of this potential role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-cytokine agents may prove useful in optimizing the efficacy of rh-Epo in anaemic chronic renal failure patients. Other potential therapeutic strategies include minimizing exposure to causes of inflammation from various co-morbid conditions.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, and more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a possible cause of anemia when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². This is especially pertinent if the GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² in patients with diabetes, and no other cause such as blood loss, folic acid, or vitamin B12 deficiency is identified.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1159mjTY]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Estimating the burden imposed by anemia is not a trivial task. The difficulties in reliably quantifying its consequences stem from complex challenges related to its diagnosis. Anemia is multifactorial and can result from various causes, which are often hard to differentiate, making accurate diagnosis challenging, especially in developing countries. Moreover, multiple types of anemia can occur simultaneously, often presenting with similar symptoms, complicating the task of distinguishing and accurately attributing the specific causes of anemia on a global scale. Achieving this requires more comprehensive, high-quality data to understand and quantify the contributions of different underlying causes across diverse populations.

Over-attribution to iron deficiency anemia, the most common type of anemia, is an important issue due to its status as a default diagnosis in regions with limited diagnostic resources and its high prevalence as a primary etiology in many populations. Analyses often rely on iron deficiency, while only about half of anemia cases globally are due to it, leading to misdiagnosis and misclassification. Therefore, assessing anemia should involve testing various biomarkers (e.g. ferritin and retinol) with different sensitivities and specificities.

- **Biomarker complexity**: The complexity is further heightened and compounded by interactions with factors like inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, and pregnancy, especially in developing countries where multiple types of anemia can coexist.

### Prevalence of anemia and effects on mortality in patients with heart failure [^111pQ8zP]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease, the adverse cardiovascular effects of anemia have been well established. New data are emerging to suggest anemia may represent an important treatable cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. To improve understanding of the problem of anemia in heart failure, it is important to assess the factors that influence the prevalence of anemia and evaluate the consistency of the association between anemia and mortality in various populations of patients with heart failure.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was conducted by performing detailed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, examining the bibliographies of the articles retrieved during the database search, and consulting with heart-failure experts involved in clinical trials. Twenty-eight publications from 26 studies that evaluated anemia prevalence with or without effects on mortality in patients with heart failure were identified. The definition of anemia used in each study was tabulated, along with pertinent patient characteristics, the prevalence of anemia, and the association between anemia and mortality.

- **Results**: Anemia is common among patients with heart failure. The prevalence of anemia increases with increasing severity of heart failure, declining renal function, and increasing age. Anemia is consistently associated with poorer survival in all patient populations, but there are substantial differences in the patient populations and definitions of anemia.

### Regulation of iron homeostasis in anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications [^1114Y6P7]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is characterized by macrophage iron retention induced by cytokines and the master regulator hepcidin. Hepcidin controls cellular iron efflux by binding to the iron export protein ferroportin. Many patients, however, present with both ACD and iron deficiency anemia (ACD/IDA), the latter resulting from chronic blood loss. We used a rat model of ACD resulting from chronic arthritis and mimicked ACD/IDA by additional phlebotomy to define differing iron-regulatory pathways.

Iron retention during inflammation occurs in macrophages and the spleen but not in the liver. In rats and humans with ACD, serum hepcidin concentrations are elevated, which is paralleled by reduced duodenal and macrophage expression of ferroportin. Individuals with ACD/IDA have significantly lower hepcidin levels than ACD subjects, and ACD/IDA persons, in contrast to ACD subjects, were able to absorb dietary iron from the gut and mobilize iron from macrophages. Circulating hepcidin levels affect iron traffic in ACD and ACD/IDA and are more responsive to the erythropoietic demands for iron than to inflammation. Hepcidin determination may aid in differentiating between ACD and ACD/IDA and in selecting appropriate therapy for these patients.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns frequently encountered in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered:

- **Anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts**: This pattern can indicate a range of underlying issues that need to be further investigated.

- **Anemia with increased reticulocyte counts**: Typically suggests active red blood cell (RBC) production which may be compensatory for hemolysis or acute bleeding.

- **Life-long history of chronic anemia**: This indicates a stable, long-standing anemic condition that requires thorough historical evaluation.

- **Anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes**: Suggests a problem in red blood cell production.

The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Anemia at older age: Etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^113hS5xH]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and serves as a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia in older age is increasing, primarily due to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies.

The etiology of anemia at older age is complex and ranges from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes, including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as having unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In other cases, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled. This condition is termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance.

Management of anemia at older age depends on the severity of the anemia, the underlying condition(s), and patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that, due to age-related changes, organ function, such as erythropoietin production in the kidney, may become suboptimal. Management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function.

Other causes include sideroblastic anemia, anemia of chronic inflammation, hereditary atransferrinemia, iron deficiency anemia, and lead poisoning.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: Current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective, and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide hepcidin plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for the detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels. However, where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Pathogenesis and clinical implications of HIV-related anemia in 2013 [^116FvDEb]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common feature of HIV-related disease and has been uniformly demonstrated to be an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality. Although anemia often responds to combination antiretroviral therapy, many patients remain anemic despite therapy, and such persistent anemia continues to negatively affect prognosis regardless of drug response. Anemia is also a common feature of normal aging.

We postulate that the pathophysiology of anemia in HIV, especially that which persists in the face of combination antiretroviral therapy, reflects underlying proinflammatory pathways. These pathways are also thought to contribute to anemia in the elderly, as well as other age-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This suggests that HIV induces inflammatory pathways associated with a pattern of accelerated aging and that anemia is a biomarker of these processes.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV-related anemia may provide important entry points for improving the chronic manifestations of HIV-related disease.

### How I treat renal anemia [^1148K2kY]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication of kidney disease. When severe, it causes symptoms that can be debilitating. The course of anemia tends to track the decline in kidney function, with prevalence increasing in more advanced disease. Although the most common cause is relative erythropoietin deficiency, other factors such as reduced iron availability contribute to the pathobiology. In this review, we use cases to explore the surprising complexity of decision-making in management of renal anemia.

### An update on anemia in less developed countries [^1139aDTZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

The highest prevalence of anemia exists in the developing world, where its causes are multi-factorial.

Understanding the causes of anemia and potential mechanisms is crucial to our ability to intervene and reduce this burden. In the past decade, our understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of anemia in LDCs has advanced significantly. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of the burden of anemia in specific sub-groups, the causes and mechanisms of anemia, and the consequences of anemia for the human host.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1111w91K]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **The global burden and diverse etiology of anemia**: Anemia is a prevalent global health issue characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating red blood cells or a lower-than-normal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, irrespective of the underlying cause such as red blood cell enzyme deficiency, red blood cell membrane disorders, hemoglobinopathies, or kidney disease, resulting in a diminished oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Clinically, anemia is conventionally determined when Hb levels fall below the established normal threshold for age, sex, and physiological status. Anemia can be subdivided into acute anemia, typically resulting from sudden blood loss, or chronic anemia, which develops over time and is often associated with underlying health conditions such as nutritional deficiencies or chronic diseases. Chronic anemia is accompanied by significant adverse health outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality, and imposes substantial health and economic burdens worldwide.

In 2021, the global prevalence of anemia, encompassing both chronic and acute forms, was 24.3%, a decrease from 28.2% in 1990. Nevertheless, the total number of individuals affected by anemia has increased due to population growth, rising from 1.50 billion in 1990 to 1.92 billion in 2021. In 2021, it accounted for 52.0 million years lived with disability (YLDs), which translates to 5.7% of all YLDs globally, making it one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.

Some specific populations and demographics are dramatically affected by chronic anemia. Women of reproductive age (15–49 years) face a high…

### The definition of anemia: What is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

Anaemia remains a major public health issue across the life course. The persistently high anaemia burden, particularly in women of reproductive age and young children, underscores the need for renewed attention on accurately measuring the prevalence of anaemia and its underlying causes and using these data to design comprehensive policies and interventions that reflect the context-specific epidemiology of the disease and its determinants. Analyses of population-level anaemia burden can provide the insights required to appropriately tailor interventions at the country and subnational levels in an effort to reduce the prevalence of anaemia across all ages and sexes. Although probably not obtainable for most countries, multifaceted and contextual approaches will be necessary to ensure substantive progress towards Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 3 and WHO Global Nutrition Targets.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113hjMh8]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

With the globally growing older adult population, clinicians face the common yet complex challenge of evaluating and managing anemia in this group. Older age predisposes individuals to common causes of anemia, such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality.

Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because it may have a single cause, be multifactorial, or have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. A systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial to ensure appropriate testing and avoid the pitfalls of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article, we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for managing anemia in older adults.

### Anemia of inflammation [^116xxuaK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte life span all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority.

- **Hepcidin**: Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Anemia in elderly patients: An emerging problem for the 21st century [^112dabUZ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is a significant problem in elderly patients. Although many anemic elderly patients can be diagnosed with nutritional deficiency or anemia of chronic inflammation or comorbid diseases that explain their decreased hematocrit, the etiology of anemia in a significant fraction remains obscure. There is evidence to suggest that the hematopoietic stem cell displays increasing erythropoietin (EPO) resistance with age.

EPO levels rise in elderly, non-anemic patients, and it is hypothesized that there is an interplay between this rising demand for EPO and the decreasing ability of the aging kidney to produce adequate hormone to meet that need. There is further considerable evidence that aging is associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine expression and that many of these cytokines can contribute to EPO insensitivity. Consequently, genetic variation in the expression of these proinflammatory cytokines may influence the development of anemia in elderly patients, both through induction of hepcidin expression (anemia of inflammation) and through cytokine suppression of erythroid colony formation.

The impact of inflammatory mediators, EPO insensitivity, and other factors that may act on the hematopoietic stem cell to decrease erythropoiesis are under active study and should serve to elucidate the pathophysiology of this important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of anemia in elderly patients should provide critical entry points for interventions that will improve survival and quality of life in the aging population.

### What is really dangerous: Anaemia or transfusion [^116Qxyrx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

While complex physiological mechanisms exist to regulate and optimize tissue oxygenation under various conditions, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that anaemia, if unchecked, is associated with organ injury and unfavourable outcomes. More data, especially from human studies, are needed to answer questions regarding the optimal approaches to the treatment of acute and chronic anaemia. In the meantime, allogeneic blood transfusions remain the most common treatment, particularly in surgical or trauma patients and those with moderate-to-severe anaemia.

Clinical studies emphasize the paradox that both anaemia and transfusion are associated with organ injury and increased morbidity and mortality across a wide span of disease states and surgical interventions. Further characterization of the mechanisms of injury is needed to appropriately balance these risks and to develop novel treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.

- **Understanding of the physiological mechanisms**: This includes tissue oxygen delivery, utilization, adaptation, and survival in the face of anaemia.
- **Evidence on the independent and synergistic impact**: Both anaemia and transfusion have a potential deleterious impact on patient outcomes.

The risks of anaemia and transfusion, in light of substantial variations in transfusion practices, increasing costs, shrinking pool of donated resources, and ambiguity about the actual clinical benefits of banked allogeneic blood, demand better management strategies targeted at improving patient outcomes.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^114cUhSs]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a major health problem worldwide. Global estimates of anaemia burden are crucial for developing appropriate interventions to meet international targets for disease mitigation. This study describes the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia and its underlying causes in 204 countries and territories.

- **Methods**: We estimated population-level distributions of haemoglobin concentration by age and sex for each location from 1990 to 2021. We then calculated anaemia burden by severity and associated years lived with disability (YLDs). With data on the prevalence of the causes of anaemia and associated cause-specific shifts in haemoglobin concentrations, we modelled the proportion of anaemia attributed to 37 underlying causes for all locations, years, and demographics in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

- **Findings**: In 2021, the global prevalence of anaemia across all ages was 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 23.9–24.7), corresponding to 1.92 billion (1.89–1.95) prevalent cases, compared with a prevalence of 28.2% (27.8–28.5) and 1.50 billion (1.48–1.52) prevalent cases in 1990. Large variations were observed in anaemia burden by age, sex, and geography, with children younger than 5 years, women, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia being particularly affected. Anaemia caused 52.0 million (35.1–75.1) YLDs in 2021, and the YLD rate due to anaemia declined with increasing Socio-demographic Index. The most common causes of anaemia YLDs in 2021 were dietary iron deficiency.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: Etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^115NWJD9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Up to 15% of people aged 60 and over are anemic, and the prevalence of anemia increases with age. In older men and women, anemia is associated with increases in the risk of death, all-cause hospitalization, poor functional capacity, quality of life, and depression.

- **Methods and results**: We reviewed the literature describing anemia in aging populations, focusing on the specific diagnostic criteria of anemia and potential causes in older men and women. Even after extensive etiologic workup that involves careful medical history, physical examination, laboratory measurements, and additional studies such as bone marrow biopsy, anemia of aging is unexplained in up to 40% of older patients with anemia. As a result, treatment options remain limited.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of unexplained anemia of aging (UAA; also called unexplained anemia of the elderly, UAE), its deleterious impacts on health, physical function, and quality of life, and the lack of effective treatment or therapy guidelines represent a compelling unmet clinical need. In this review and consensus document, we discuss the scope of the problem, possible causes of UAA, diagnostic criteria, and potential treatment options. Because even mild anemia is strongly linked to poor clinical outcomes, it should receive clinical attention rather than simply being considered a normal part of aging.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is a comprehensive effort to systematically measure the causes and risk factors of death and disability. Anaemia-specific manuscripts relating to the 2010 and 2013 GBDs have previously been published. Other studies examining trends in anaemia burden at the global level have often been limited to particular demographic groups, such as children or women of reproductive age, geographies like low-income settings, or specific underlying causes such as iron deficiency. Consequently, these studies do not capture the full extent of the anaemia burden. For instance, the 2022 WHO estimates present anaemia burden among children aged 6–59 months and women aged 15–49 years from 2000 to 2019. In this context, the GBD provides an ideal framework to comprehensively quantify the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia burden across all geographies, demographics, and causes. To estimate total anaemia prevalence, we used individual-level and tabulated survey and report data from the Global Health Data Exchange, identified using the keywords "anemia" and "hemoglobin", supplemented with sources from the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System. This comprehensive database includes measurements of haemoglobin concentration and anaemia prevalence collected from systematic reviews of scientific literature databases; WHO regional and country offices; other research, governmental, and non-governmental organisations; and manual searches of non-indexed journals.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: Etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^113vHCGw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Unexplained anemia of aging poses several challenges, including its unclear etiology and potential health consequences. Understanding the diagnostic criteria is crucial in addressing this condition.

- **Etiology**: The origin of unexplained anemia in the elderly remains largely unknown. It is often associated with a combination of nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and age-related decline in bone marrow function.
- **Health consequences**: Anemia in the aging population can lead to decreased physical performance, increased risk of falls, and heightened mortality rates. It is also linked with cognitive decline and a diminished quality of life.
- **Diagnostic criteria**: Identifying this type of anemia involves ruling out other common causes such as iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and chronic kidney disease. Comprehensive blood tests and clinical evaluations are necessary for accurate diagnosis.

A collaborative approach in research and clinical practice is essential to improve the understanding and management of unexplained anemia of aging.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^113D8qwA]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Anaemia develops when the red cell mass is insufficient to meet physiological oxygen-carrying needs and is usually formally diagnosed when the haemoglobin concentration falls below a defined threshold for age and sex. Accurate case definition of anaemia is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and for understanding the magnitude and distribution of this condition as a public health problem. WHO's anaemia definitions aim to reflect the lower fifth centile of the haemoglobin distribution of a reference population of healthy individuals. WHO thresholds were initially proposed in 1958, then updated in 1968, and have remained essentially unchanged since. WHO thresholds were based on studies with restricted measurement of biomarkers of iron and other forms of haematinic deficiency and inflammation. There is limited consensus on anaemia definitions, leading to heterogeneous definitions between sources, expert groups, and public health bodies, translating into inconsistent clinical definitions.

Establishing a valid diagnosis of anaemia is crucial for treating patients and detecting the range of diseases that could underlie this condition. Anaemia can cause clinical effects directly (e.g. anaemia causes a substantial burden of disease); however, even in the absence of overt clinical effects, haemoglobin-based thresholds for anaemia are used as important triggers for investigation and optimisation of underlying contributors. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced by acute, recurrent, chronic medical, or surgical illness. Inflammation (e.g. due to autoimmune disease, infection).

### Investigation of the role of interleukin-6 and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide in the development of anemia with age [^117C1xTE]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in older adults and is associated with adverse health outcomes in epidemiological studies. A thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms driving anemia in the elderly is lacking; however, inflammation, iron restriction, and impaired erythroid maturation are thought to influence the phenotype. We hypothesized that interleukin-6 contributes to this anemia, given its pro-inflammatory activities, its ability to induce hepcidin antimicrobial peptide, and its negative impact on several tissues in older adults.

We tested this hypothesis by comparing changes in indices of inflammation, iron metabolism, and erythropoiesis in aged C57BL/6 mice to aged mice with targeted deletions of interleukin-6 or hepcidin antimicrobial peptide. Circulating neutrophil and monocyte numbers and inflammatory cytokines increased with age. A decline in hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell number indicated that C57BL/6, interleukin-6 knockout mice, and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide knockout mice all demonstrated impaired erythropoiesis by 24 months.

However, the interleukin-6 knockout genotype and the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide knockout genotype resulted in improved erythropoiesis in aged mice. Increased erythropoietic activity in the spleen suggested that the erythroid compartment was stressed in aged C57BL/6 mice compared to aged interleukin-6 knockout mice. Our data suggest C57BL/6 mice are an appropriate mammalian model for the study of anemia with age. Furthermore, although interleukin-6 and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide are not required, they can participate in these processes.

Implications of all the available evidence

We show that progress towards alleviating the anaemia burden across age, sex, and geography is varied and often slow. Our analysis of the underlying causes of anaemia provides insights for the design of effective, contextualized disease surveillance programs and public health interventions. Although iron deficiency is often the most frequent cause of anaemia, much of the iron-related anaemia burden could be unresponsive to iron treatments if the underlying issues relating to iron deficiency are not addressed. Interventions to deal with major causes of anaemia — such as chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, malaria, and, where prevalent, neglected tropical diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm disease — are necessary to substantially reduce anaemia burden.

Important gaps in data and knowledge remain, necessitating the development of evidence-based definitions of anaemia centered on actual health loss, quantification of morbidity and mortality associated with low haemoglobin concentrations as a risk factor for other illnesses, and analysis of the effect of comorbid diseases on the incidence and severity of anaemia. Investments in closing these gaps will improve future estimates of the burden of anaemia and will provide policymakers, stakeholders, and health practitioners with the comprehensive data needed to reduce persistently high anaemia prevalence and associated health loss.

The WHO's Global Nutrition Target calls for a 50% reduction in anaemia prevalence among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by 2030.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^113a1ABe]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Anemia remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in high-altitude populations where physiological adaptations complicate standard diagnostic practices. WHO Hb cutoff points may lead to misclassification, either under- or overestimating anemia in high-altitude regions. To address this, a refined approach is needed, incorporating revised diagnostic thresholds tailored to population-specific adaptations, alongside personalized clinical assessments and emerging biomarkers. Additionally, integrating genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors will enhance diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy. Implementing this comprehensive framework would facilitate greater diagnostic precision, enable more targeted therapeutic interventions, and enhance health outcomes for the populations most impacted.

### Impact of C-reactive protein on the effect of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113nmJsn]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition resulting from a heterogeneous range of diseases, ultimately leading to irreversible alterations in kidney function and structure. Globally, over 10% of the population is affected by CKD, making it an increasingly significant health burden on society. While the precise pathological mechanisms driving CKD are not fully understood, a growing list of primary and secondary risk factors has been identified. Among these factors, anemia emerges as a hallmark complication of CKD and is associated with a poor prognosis. Its occurrence is linked to various elements, such as impaired renal endocrine function resulting in inadequate secretion of erythropoietin (EPO), uremic toxin accumulation, chronic inflammation, impaired iron metabolism, and a shortened half-life of erythrocytes. Consequently, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) have been the standard therapy for treating renal anemia since the 1990s.

Simultaneously, chronic inflammation is common in CKD patients. As a marker of systemic inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) stands out as an independent risk factor for CKD. Previous studies have indicated that ESA is less effective in patients with renal anemia with high CRP levels. The necessity for an increased dose required to maintain target hemoglobin concentration may elevate the risk of cardiovascular events and tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that CRP levels may impact the efficacy of drugs used for treating CKD anemia.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) represent an emerging class of drugs, demonstrating potential in treating CKD-associated anemia.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: Global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^1121y8V1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major global health challenge affecting an estimated quarter of the world's population, imposing a substantial burden in terms of morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic costs. Although iron deficiency remains the most frequently cited cause, the etiological landscape of anemia is remarkably diverse. It includes deficiencies of other micronutrients, such as vitamin B12 and folate, hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, and anemia of chronic disease. Women of reproductive age and young children are especially vulnerable, with iron deficiency anemia contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes, impaired cognitive development, and heightened susceptibility to infection. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are therefore pivotal to controlling this significant public health issue.

Diagnosing anemia, however, is far from straightforward. Hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs established by the World Health Organization (WHO) provide widely accepted thresholds for identifying anemia in the general population, yet these reference values were largely developed and validated in low-altitude and high-income settings. Such generalized classifications often fail to capture the complexities of diverse global populations, particularly individuals living in high-altitude regions (> 2500 m). Due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude, an elevated Hb concentration is a normal physiological adaptation to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. When altitude-dependent Hb correction cutoffs are applied in these environments, they can identify anemia inaccurately.

Anaemia is a major health problem worldwide. Global estimates of anaemia burden are crucial for developing appropriate interventions to meet international targets for disease mitigation. This study describes the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia and its underlying causes in 204 countries and territories.

- **Methods**: We estimated population-level distributions of haemoglobin concentration by age and sex for each location from 1990 to 2021. We then calculated anaemia burden by severity and associated years lived with disability (YLDs). With data on prevalence of the causes of anaemia and associated cause-specific shifts in haemoglobin concentrations, we modelled the proportion of anaemia attributed to 37 underlying causes for all locations, years, and demographics in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

### Anemia in chronic heart failure: pathogenetic mechanisms [^115zFEUA]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia can be the cause of heart failure, but also its consequence. The pathogenesis of anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) has yet to be fully elucidated but is likely to be complex. Epidemiologic studies suggest several factors may be important in the development of anemia in CHF: kidney dysfunction (by reducing the erythropoietic response to anemia), inflammation (by inducing erythropoietin resistance), decreased body mass index, old age, female gender, and poor clinical status. Intestinal malabsorption, chronic aspirin use, and proteinuria predispose individuals to iron deficiency. Proinflammatory cytokines are likely to play a significant role in anemia in CHF by generating the "anemia of chronic illness" that is a hallmark of inflammatory conditions. Few studies have investigated the mechanisms of anemia in CHF, indicating a need for further research in this area.

In the context of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), particularly concerning patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of IDA. This involves determining whether the anemia is due to inadequate intake, poor absorption, or iron loss, often from gastrointestinal bleeding. Best practice advice stresses the importance of treating active inflammation to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion.

### Iron in sickle-cell disease: What have we learned over the years [^115c1hSv]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last four decades, monumental advances have been made in the understanding, assessment, and management of transfusion-dependent patients, which have translated into significant improvements in patient morbidity and mortality. Important lessons have been learned from extensive clinical experience of iron management in the thalassemias, but greater knowledge of key differences in the sickle-cell disease (SCD) population may impact our approach to patient assessment and management. The unique pathophysiology of SCD is reflected in a distinct pattern of iron loading with minimal organ-specific injury. An appreciation and understanding of these differences should allow us to develop tailored management approaches that optimize patient outcomes.

### The anemia of inflammation/malignancy: mechanisms and management [^111z2C6o]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2008).

Anemia is a common complication in patients with inflammatory diseases of many kinds, including cancer. The mechanisms that have captured the most attention include cytokine-mediated changes in both the production of and the response to erythropoietin (Epo), as well as important alterations in iron metabolism. This is brought about by the relatively recently recognized peptide hormone, hepcidin.

The availability of recombinant human Epo and its derivatives, known by class as erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESAs), has dramatically changed anemia management in patients with cancer but, in the process, has raised as many issues as have been answered. This chapter reviews the mechanisms resulting in anemia in inflammation, including cancer, and focuses on the controversies around management with the ESAs and the adjuvant use of iron in anemia management.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests based on the initial assessment to diagnose the cause of anemia in selected cases:

- **Serum B12 and serum folate concentrations**: These tests help assess vitamin deficiency-related anemia.
- **Tests for hemolysis**: These include plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, LDH, bilirubin, and Coombs' test. These help identify hemolytic anemia.
- **Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis**: This test checks for abnormal proteins in the blood or urine.
- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Useful for identifying hemoglobinopathies.
- **Free light chains and bone marrow examination**: These are considered for diagnosing abnormalities in protein production and bone marrow disorders.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, etc), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches, and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.
