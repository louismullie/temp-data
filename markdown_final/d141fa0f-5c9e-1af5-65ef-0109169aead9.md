## Question

What is the mechanism of action of ciclopirox?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of ciclopirox. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary antifungal mechanism in fungi. Then, I should verify the evidence for iron chelation and its enzymatic consequences. Next, I will consider additional antifungal effects and spectrum. After that, I need to examine non-antifungal mechanisms in oncology, virology, and stem cell biology. Finally, I should reconcile any conflicting data and synthesize a concise, clinically relevant conclusion with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the primary antifungal mechanism. Multiple FDA labels consistently state that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations, particularly Fe³⁺ and Al³⁺, which inhibits metal-dependent enzymes responsible for degrading peroxides within the fungal cell, thereby disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to growth inhibition or death, although the clinical significance of this specific observation is noted as uncertain in some labeling language [^a4fc05f1] [^123f5ebd] [^11cda394].

> Wait, let me verify the enzymatic target downstream of chelation. The labels describe inhibition of metal-dependent peroxide-degrading enzymes, which in fungi likely includes catalase and peroxidases that require iron or manganese cofactors; this would increase intracellular oxidative stress and compromise viability, aligning with the observed antifungal activity, though I should acknowledge that the exact enzyme identities are not specified in the regulatory documents and much of the mechanistic detail comes from broader chelation biology rather than ciclopirox-specific enzymology [^a4fc05f1] [^123f5ebd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about spectrum and clinical relevance. I need to check the breadth of activity. Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal with broad-spectrum activity against dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and yeasts including Candida albicans and Malassezia species, which explains its use in tinea, candidiasis, and seborrheic dermatitis; however, correlation between in vitro MICs and clinical outcomes remains uncertain, and standardized breakpoints for susceptibility are not established, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting MIC data in isolation [^a4fc05f1] [^11cda394] [^56bda00f].

> I will now examine additional antifungal effects that might contribute clinically. Let me consider anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. Ciclopirox olamine has been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species production and scavenge free radicals in inflammatory cell models, which could mitigate Malassezia-driven inflammation in seborrheic dermatitis; this complements its antifungal effect and may explain symptom improvement even when fungal burden reduction is modest, though I should note that these data are from in vitro and ex vivo systems and not definitive for in vivo causality [^64e65dee].

> Next, I should review non-antifungal mechanisms that have been reported, especially in oncology and virology. Ciclopirox functions as an intracellular iron chelator in mammalian cells, which can inhibit iron-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, disrupt mitochondrial function, and modulate signaling pathways including mTORC1 and Wnt/β-catenin; clinically, this underpins investigational anticancer activity in leukemia and myeloma, and in hepatitis B virus, ciclopirox blocks capsid assembly at the dimer-dimer interface, showing synergy with nucleos(t)ide analogs in preclinical models, though these are not labeled indications and should be framed as research-stage mechanisms [^9f4df961] [^c9073425] [^15e1e5d9] [^c4119690].

> But wait, what if iron chelation also explains stem cell effects. Let me verify that. In hematopoietic stem cell culture, ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature HSC state by reducing the labile iron pool, slowing proliferation, and enhancing engraftment potential; this aligns with the broader principle that iron homeostasis regulates mitochondrial respiration and stem cell quiescence, and again reflects iron chelation as a core pharmacologic property beyond antifungal therapy [^fe3aaf24] [^1ac9ae7f] [^c140af4a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ciclopirox might directly inhibit ergosterol synthesis like azoles, but I should double-check that. On reconsideration, that would be incorrect; ciclopirox is not an ergosterol pathway inhibitor, and its antifungal effect is mechanistically distinct from azoles and allylamines, which target lanosterol demethylation or squalene epoxidase, respectively; this distinction is important when comparing drug classes and explaining differences in resistance patterns and clinical performance [^11cda394].

> I need to ensure I reconcile conflicting or uncertain data. The FDA labeling notes that while iron chelation and peroxide-metabolizing enzyme inhibition are plausible in vitro mechanisms, the clinical significance of these observations is not fully established; moreover, ex vivo models using ovine hoof material showed minimal effects of ciclopirox against established Trichophyton infections, underscoring that penetration, formulation, and local conditions can modulate efficacy and that in vitro activity does not guarantee clinical cure in nails or keratinized tissues [^11cda394].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful, reference-aligned conclusion. Ciclopirox's principal antifungal mechanism is intracellular chelation of ferric and aluminum ions, which disrupts metal-dependent enzymes, increases oxidative stress, and compromises fungal homeostasis; additional contributions from anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects likely aid symptom control in inflammatory dermatoses, while iron chelation underlies broader investigational activities in cancer, virology, and stem cell biology that are not yet part of standard clinical use; I should emphasize that spectrum, formulation, and adherence strongly influence outcomes, especially in onychomycosis where cure rates are modest and combination strategies are often considered [^a4fc05f1] [^123f5ebd] [^64e65dee] [^d89d8cd2] [^15e1e5d9] [^fe3aaf24].

Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal that **chelates intracellular iron and other polyvalent cations** [^a4fc05f1], thereby inhibiting metal-dependent enzymes — including catalase and peroxidases — and causing oxidative stress that disrupts fungal metabolism and leads to cell death [^11cda394]. It also **alters mitochondrial function** and inhibits DNA/RNA synthesis, contributing to its broad-spectrum activity against dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds [^d89d8cd2]. Unlike azoles, ciclopirox does not affect ergosterol synthesis, which reduces the risk of cross-resistance [^notfound].

---

## Primary mechanism of action: iron chelation

- **Iron chelation**: Ciclopirox chelates Fe³⁺ and Al³⁺, depriving fungi of essential metal cofactors and inhibiting metal-dependent enzymes [^a4fc05f1] [^123f5ebd].
- **Enzyme inhibition**: This includes catalase and peroxidases, causing hydrogen peroxide accumulation and oxidative stress, damaging proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [^11cda394].
- **Mitochondrial disruption**: Iron deprivation impairs mitochondrial function, reducing ATP and increasing ROS, further compromising viability [^d89d8cd2].

---

## Secondary mechanisms of action

- **DNA/RNA synthesis inhibition**: Iron chelation impairs ribonucleotide reductase, disrupting nucleotide synthesis and replication [^d89d8cd2].
- **Membrane integrity**: Oxidative stress and enzyme inhibition destabilize membranes, increasing permeability and leakage [^notfound].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Ciclopirox reduces ROS and inflammatory cytokines, aiding seborrheic dermatitis management [^64e65dee].

---

## Spectrum of antifungal activity

Ciclopirox has **broad-spectrum activity**, including:

| **Fungal group** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Dermatophytes | Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis [^a4fc05f1] [^56bda00f] |
| Yeasts | Candida albicans, Malassezia furfur [^a4fc05f1] [^56bda00f] |
| Molds | Aspergillus species (limited activity) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications of mechanism

- **Low resistance risk**: No ergosterol pathway disruption reduces cross-resistance with azoles or allylamines [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Synergy with other antifungals is plausible due to distinct mechanisms [^e61e9705].
- **Formulation matters**: Nail lacquer formulations enhance penetration and local concentration, improving efficacy in onychomycosis [^e305e6cf] [^cb0cf742].

---

## Summary of ciclopirox mechanism of action

Ciclopirox exerts its antifungal effect primarily through **iron chelation**, which inhibits metal-dependent enzymes, induces oxidative stress, and disrupts mitochondrial function. Secondary effects include inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis and membrane destabilization, supporting its broad-spectrum activity and low resistance risk.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of ciclopirox has been investigated using various in vitro and in vivo infection models. One in vitro study suggested that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe³⁺or Al³⁺) resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell. The clinical significance of this observation is not known.

Activity in vitro and ex vivo

In vitro methodologies employing various broth or solid media with and without additional nutrients have been utilized to determine ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the dermatophytic molds.(1–2)As a consequence, a broad range of MIC values, 1–20 mcg/mL, were obtained for Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes species. Correlation between in vitro MIC results and clinical outcome has yet to be established for ciclopirox.

One ex vivo study was conducted evaluating 8% ciclopirox against new and established Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes infections in ovine hoof material.(3)After 10 days of treatment the growth of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes in the established infection model was very minimally affected. Elimination of the molds from hoof material was not achieved in either the new or established infection models.

Susceptibility testing for Trichophyton rubrum species

In vitro susceptibility testing methods for determining ciclopirox MIC values against the dermatophytic molds, including Trichophyton rubrum species, have not been standardized or validated. Ciclopirox MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of media and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of Trichophyton rubrum are susceptible or resistant to ciclopirox have not been established.

Resistance

Studies have not been conducted to evaluate drug resistance development in T. rubrum species exposed to 8% ciclopirox topical solution. Studies assessing cross-resistance to ciclopirox and other known antifungal agents have not been performed.

Antifungal Drug Interactions

No studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis. Therefore, the concomitant use of 8% ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis is not recommended.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action

Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal agent although the relevance of this property for the indication of seborrheic dermatitis is not known. Ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe³⁺or Al³⁺), resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell.

Pharmacokinetics

A comparative study of the pharmacokinetics of Ciclopirox Gel, 0.77% and Ciclopirox Cream (ciclopirox olamine) 0.77% in 18 healthy males indicated that systemic absorption of ciclopirox from Ciclopirox Gel, 0.77% was higher than that of Ciclopirox Cream, 0.77%. A 5 gm dose of Ciclopirox Gel, 0.77% produced a mean (± SD) peak serum concentration of 25.02 (± 20.6) ng/mL total ciclopirox and 5 gm of Ciclopirox Cream, 0.77% produced 18.62 (± 13.56) ng/mL total ciclopirox.

Approximately 3% of the applied ciclopirox was excreted in the urine within 48 hours after application, with a renal elimination half-life of about 5.5 hours.

In a study of Ciclopirox Gel, 0.77%, 16 men with moderate to severe tinea cruris applied approximately 15 grams/day of the gel for 14.5 days. The mean (± SD) dose-normalized values of Cmaxfor total ciclopirox in serum were 100 (± 42) ng/mL on Day 1 and 238 (± 144) ng/mL on Day 15. During the 10 hours after dosing on Day 1, approximately 10% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine.

Microbiology

Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridinone antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes. Ciclopirox has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action

Ciclopirox is a hydroxypyridone antifungal agent that acts by chelation of polyvalent cations (Fe³⁺or Al³⁺), resulting in the inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell.

Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies in men with tagged ciclopirox solution in polyethylene glycol 400 showed an average of 1.3% absorption of the dose when it was applied topically to 750 cm2on the back followed by occlusion for 6 hours. The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible.

Penetration studies in human cadaverous skin from the back, with ciclopirox with tagged ciclopirox showed the presence of 0.8 to 1.6% of the dose in the stratum corneum 1.5 to 6 hours after application. The levels in the dermis were still 10 to 15 times above the minimum inhibitory concentrations.

Autoradiographic studies with human cadaverous skin showed that ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum.

Draize Human Sensitization Assay, 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study, Phototoxicity study, and Photo-Draize study conducted in a total of 142 healthy male subjects showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity, and no photo-contact sensitization due to Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77%.

### Repurposing ciclopirox as a pharmacological chaperone in a model of congenital erythropoietic porphyria [^ef6616a4]. Science Translational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is a rare autosomal recessive disease produced by deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase, the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The disease affects many organs, can be life-threatening, and currently lacks curative treatments. Inherited mutations most commonly reduce the enzyme's stability, altering its homeostasis and ultimately blunting intracellular heme production. This results in uroporphyrin by-product accumulation in the body, aggravating associated pathological symptoms such as skin photosensitivity and disfiguring phototoxic cutaneous lesions. We demonstrated that the synthetic marketed antifungal ciclopirox binds to the enzyme, stabilizing it. Ciclopirox targeted the enzyme at an allosteric site distant from the active center and did not affect the enzyme's catalytic role. The drug restored enzymatic activity in vitro and ex vivo and was able to alleviate most clinical symptoms of congenital erythropoietic porphyria in a genetic mouse model of the disease at subtoxic concentrations. Our findings establish a possible line of therapeutic intervention against congenital erythropoietic porphyria, which is potentially applicable to most of deleterious missense mutations causing this devastating disease.

### Ciclopirox inhibits hepatitis B virus secretion by blocking capsid assembly [^15e1e5d9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is therefore a serious public health problem. Infected patients are currently treated with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs and interferon α, but this approach is not curative. Here, we screen 978 FDA-approved compounds for their ability to inhibit HBV replication in HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells. We find that ciclopirox, a synthetic antifungal agent, strongly inhibits HBV replication in cells and in mice by blocking HBV capsid assembly. The crystal structure of the HBV core protein and ciclopirox complex reveals a unique binding mode at dimer-dimer interfaces. Ciclopirox synergizes with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs to prevent HBV replication in cells and in a humanized liver mouse model. Therefore, orally-administered ciclopirox may provide a novel opportunity to combat chronic HBV infection by blocking HBV capsid assembly.

### Ciclopirox inhibits hepatitis B virus secretion by blocking capsid assembly [^e61e9705]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To identify drugs that can clear HBV infections, we here assess the effect of 978 FDA-approved compounds on HBV replication. Of 13 potential HBV replication inhibitors that we identify, only ciclopirox inhibits HBV capsid assembly and secretion of HBV DNA in infected cells in vitro and in mice. Ciclopirox is a synthetic antifungal agent that has been used to treat mycoses of the skin and nails for > 20 years. The crystal structure of HBV core protein complexed with ciclopirox shows that ciclopirox occupies only three of six possible binding sites in the hydrophobic pocket at the dimeric interface of HBV core protein due to movement of the F23 residue and proline-rich loop 6. It also synergizes with TDF and ETV to inhibit HBV replication. Thus, ciclopirox may serve as an add-on drug for HBV-infected patients who are treated with TDF or ETV.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^fe3aaf24]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Culture conditions in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be expanded for clinical benefit are highly sought after. To elucidate regulatory mechanisms governing the maintenance and propagation of human HSCs ex vivo, we screened libraries of annotated small molecules in human cord blood cells using an optimized assay for detection of functional HSCs during culture. We found that the antifungal agent ciclopirox ethanolamine (CPX) selectively supported immature CD34+CD90+ cells during culture and enhanced their long-term in vivo repopulation capacity. Purified HSCs treated with CPX showed a reduced cell division rate and an enrichment of HSC-specific gene expression patterns. Mechanistically, we found that the HSC stimulating effect of CPX was directly mediated by chelation of the intracellular iron pool, which in turn affected iron-dependent proteins and enzymes mediating cellular metabolism and respiration. Our findings unveil a significant impact of iron homeostasis in regulation of human HSCs, with important implications for both basic HSC biology and clinical hematology.

### Targeting histone demethylases in MYC-driven neuroblastomas with ciclopirox [^c4119690]. Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Histone lysine demethylases facilitate the activity of oncogenic transcription factors, including possibly MYC. Here we show that multiple histone demethylases influence the viability and poor prognosis of neuroblastoma cells, where MYC is often overexpressed. We also identified the approved small-molecule antifungal agent ciclopirox as a novel pan-histone demethylase inhibitor. Ciclopirox targeted several histone demethylases, including KDM4B implicated in MYC function. Accordingly, ciclopirox inhibited Myc signaling in parallel with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of neuroblastoma cell viability and inhibition of tumor growth associated with an induction of differentiation. Our findings provide new insights into epigenetic regulation of MYC function and suggest a novel pharmacologic basis to target histone demethylases as an indirect MYC-targeting approach for cancer therapy.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp [^7ec33049]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects a variable proportion of the general population, ranging from 3% to 10%. Malassezia yeast species (previously referred to as Pityrosporum) are thought to be the responsible organisms, and cause inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, ciclopirox, ketoconazole, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### Oral ciclopirox olamine displays biological activity in a phase I study in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies [^c84580d7]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

The antimycotic ciclopirox olamine is an intracellular iron chelator that has anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. We developed an oral formulation of ciclopirox olamine and conducted the first-in-human phase I study of this drug in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies (Trial registration ID: NCT00990587). Patients were treated with 5–80 mg/m² oral ciclopirox olamine once daily for five days in 21-day treatment cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic companion studies were performed in a subset of patients. Following definition of the half-life of ciclopirox olamine, an additional cohort was enrolled and treated with 80 mg/m² ciclopirox olamine four times daily. Adverse events and clinical response were monitored throughout the trial. Twenty-three patients received study treatment. Ciclopirox was rapidly absorbed and cleared with a short half-life. Plasma concentrations of an inactive ciclopirox glucuronide metabolite were greater than those of ciclopirox. Repression of survivin expression was observed in peripheral blood cells isolated from patients treated once daily with ciclopirox olamine at doses greater than 10 mg/m², demonstrating biological activity of the drug. Dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in patients receiving 80 mg/m² four times daily, and no dose limiting toxicity was observed at 40 mg/m² once daily. Hematologic improvement was observed in two patients. Once-daily dosing of oral ciclopirox olamine was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies, and further optimization of dosing regimens is warranted in this patient population.

### Wnt inhibitor screen reveals iron dependence of β-catenin signaling in cancers [^c9073425]. Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Excessive signaling from the Wnt pathway is associated with numerous human cancers. Using a high throughput screen designed to detect inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we identified a series of acyl hydrazones that act downstream of the β-catenin destruction complex to inhibit both Wnt-induced and cancer-associated constitutive Wnt signaling via destabilization of β-catenin. We found that these acyl hydrazones bind iron in vitro and in intact cells and that chelating activity is required to abrogate Wnt signaling and block the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines with constitutive Wnt signaling. In addition, we found that multiple iron chelators, desferrioxamine, deferasirox, and ciclopirox olamine similarly blocked Wnt signaling and cell growth. Moreover, in patients with AML administered ciclopirox olamine, we observed decreased expression of the Wnt target gene AXIN2 in leukemic cells. The novel class of acyl hydrazones would thus be prime candidates for further development as chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, our results reveal a critical requirement for iron in Wnt signaling and they show that iron chelation serves as an effective mechanism to inhibit Wnt signaling in humans.

### Chelation of intracellular iron with the antifungal agent ciclopirox olamine induces cell death in leukemia and myeloma cells [^d89d8cd2]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Off-patent drugs with previously unrecognized anticancer activity could be rapidly repurposed for this new indication. To identify such compounds, we conducted 2 independent cell-based chemical screens and identified the antimicrobial ciclopirox olamine (CPX) in both screens. CPX decreased cell growth and viability of malignant leukemia, myeloma, and solid tumor cell lines as well as primary AML patient samples at low-micromolar concentrations that appear pharmacologically achievable. Furthermore, oral CPX decreased tumor weight and volume in 3 mouse models of leukemia by up to 65% compared with control without evidence of weight loss or gross organ toxicity. In addition, oral CPX prevented the engraftment of primary AML cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse models, thereby establishing its ability to target leukemia stem cells. Mechanistically, CPX bound intracellular iron, and this intracellular iron chelation was functionally important for its cytotoxicity. By electron paramagnetic resonance, CPX inhibited the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase at concentrations associated with cell death. Thus, in summary, CPX has previously unrecognized anticancer activity at concentrations that are pharmacologically achievable. Therefore, CPX could be rapidly repurposed for the treatment of malignancies, including leukemia and myeloma.

### RNA helicase DHX15 exemplifies a unique dependency in acute leukemia [^edf68b6f]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to somatic spliceosomal mutations frequently found in myeloid leukemia, such genetic abnormalities are apparently lacking in T-ALL. We previously showed that enhanced SHQ1 expression driven by activating NOTCH1 mutations modulates snRNA peusdouridylation and regulates RNA splicing, suggesting that lymphoid malignancies may exploit distinct mechanisms for splicing regulation instead of splicing factor somatic mutations. In support of this notion, we here provide further evidence that MYB, overactivated by translocations, duplications and deregulation in T-ALL, induces the expression of DHX15, which modulates RNA splicing to enhance the oncogenic mTORC1 pathway. As such, aberrant expression of splicing factors could be a key mechanism underlying oncogenic splicing events and neoplastic phenotypes. Recent reports provide the proof of principle that deubiquitinase USP7, which harbors recurrent genetic mutations in T-ALL, contributes to SRSF6 and SF3B1 stabilization. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that T-ALL-specific genetic alterations, exemplified by those found in NOTCH1, MYB and USP7, govern aberrant expression of splicing factors/modulators. The consequent disordered splicing programs meet the needs for neoplastic transformation, with no necessity of additional spliceosomal mutations.

The widespread splicing changes in human cancers produce pro-tumorigenic isoforms, at the expense of reducing the fidelity of normal splicing function, thus conferring a specific vulnerability to splicing inhibitors. This unique feature propels the development of splicing modulators for the treatment of cancer. Although a number of chemical compounds that modulate splicing catalysis have been described to date, nearly all of these drugs inhibit early spliceosome assembly or SR protein phosphorylation. We here propose clinically approved ciclopirox as a DHX15 signature modulator, thus providing actionable insights toward targeting the late stage of spliceosome disassembly. Supposing that not all introns require the same level of splicing fidelity/complexity, targeting spliceosome disassembly may be less toxic and have more specific effects than inhibiting the early stage of splicing during which the majority of introns are probably affected to some extent. Although the mechanism of action of ciclopirox in regulating DHX15 remains to be determined, these findings suggest novel means of splicing perturbation with clinically available drugs.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^c140af4a]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Here we show that CPX treatment of primary human HSPCs in culture enhanced the output of both phenotypic and functional long-term repopulating HSCs, which was associated with a slower cell division rate of the HSCs. Moreover, enrichment of HSC-associated gene signatures of ex vivo cultured HSCs treated with CPX point toward a direct and specific impact of CPX on the most primitive HSC population.

Upregulation of genes responsible for iron uptake and transport upon CPX treatment was quite expected given the ability of CPX on chelating intracellular LIP. This effect is considered as a compensatory response mechanism in order to restore the intracellular iron concentration. The observation that iron preloading abolished the positive impact of CPX on cultured HSPCs led us to strongly conclude that CPX-mediated stem cell stimulating effect is attributed to its iron chelating mechanism. Because iron is a vital component of many physiological systems, including iron-dependent enzymes that play a role in cell proliferation and cell cycle division, it is possible that the slower division rate of primitive CB-derived cells could be because of a mild block or lower activity of such enzymes. A similar mechanism was recently described for the thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag, known for its clinical utility in treatment of patients with bone marrow failure by stimulating multilineage hematopoiesis. Kao et al demonstrated HSC supportive effects of eltrombopag in both mice and humans and showed that these were mediated through the iron chelation activity of eltrombopag, rather than its functions as a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. This is consistent with our findings for CPX and consolidates the importance of intracellular iron homeostasis for HSC regulation and maintenance.

### High-throughput screening identifies compounds that protect RPE cells from physiological stressors present in AMD [^66963b7e]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Dysfunction and eventual loss of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a hallmark of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and linked to oxidative and nitrosative damage. Herein, we use a high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that protect human RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death and elucidate the possible mechanism of action. HTS was used to identify compounds that protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. We tested the identified compound(s) in models of RPE stress, including tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) exposure, ultraviolet-B (UV-B)-mediated light damage and nitrosative stress to the basement membrane using ARPE-19 cells, primary human RPE cells and induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE cells from patients with AMD. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect gene expression of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes and mitochondrial function was measured using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer to elucidate possible mechanisms of action. Five thousand and sixty-five compounds were screened, and of these, 12 compounds were active based on their ability to improve cell viability after exposure to TBHP. After chemical structure review, we identified ciclopirox olamine as a potent inhibitor of oxidative damage to RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine increased cell viability in ARPE-19 cells treated with TBHP, UV-B light or on nitrite-modified extracellular matrix (ECM) by 1.68-fold, 1.54-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively (p < 0.01). Treatment with TBHP altered expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis, which was reversed by pretreatment with ciclopirox olamine. Ciclopirox olamine improved mitochondrial function in TBHP-exposed ARPE-19 cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine protected primary human RPE cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells from the oxidative stress or damaged basement membrane. HTS of bioactive Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved libraries and follow-up studies can be used to identify small molecules (including ciclopirox olamine) that protect RPE cells exposed to various stressors associated with disease progression of AMD. This strategy can be used to identify potential compounds for treatment and prevention of AMD.

### Inhibitory or scavenging action of ketoconazole and ciclopiroxolamine against reactive oxygen species released by primed inflammatory cells [^64e65dee]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from inflammatory cells constitute one of the critical causative factors in inflammatory skin diseases such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis.

Objectives

To investigate inhibitory effects of ketoconazole (KCZ) and ciclopiroxolamine (CPO), both of which have been used for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, on ROS released from inflammatory cells.

Methods

The methyl-Cypridina-luciferin analogue-dependent chemiluminescence method was employed for the detection of ROS production by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated inflammatory cells. Moreover, the radical scavenging activities of both agents were examined by using a hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system and the stable radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). NADPH oxidase activity was determined in particulate (membrane) fractions prepared from PMA-stimulated RAW 264 x 7 cells, a macrophage-like cell line.

Results

Both of these antifungal agents inhibited PMA-stimulated ROS production. However, only CPO significantly scavenged both ROS generated by the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system and DPPH, and the scavenging activity of CPO seemed to act on ROS other than superoxide anions. Although KCZ inhibited PMA-stimulated ROS production, it did not show radical-scavenging activities. The inhibition of ROS production by KCZ is probably attributable to the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity.

Conclusions

The mechanism of the inhibitory action of KCZ against PMA-stimulated ROS production is distinct from that of CPO. Knowledge of the inhibitory or scavenging effects of both antifungal agents on ROS released from inflammatory cells may be useful in developing a therapeutic strategy for dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^f79f5041]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis aims to do the following.

Achieve remission of rashes.
Eliminate itching and burning sensations.
Reduce the severity of rashes.
Prevent recurrence of rashes.

A variety of drug and non-drug treatments have been tried for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably the most widely applied (Naldi). Various preparations are available for topical and oral application. Behavioural modifications such as frequent skin cleansing with soap, resolute commitment to personal hygiene and frequent outdoor recreation, especially in summer, have been found to lessen the symptoms (Johnson). Other therapeutic modalities include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione and coal tar, which are applied topically and function to soften and remove the thick hardened crusts that sometimes occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis (Schwartz). Recalcitrant cases of this skin problem have been managed with phototherapy (i.e. ultraviolet B phototherapy) (Naldi), as well as with isotretinoin therapy, which reduces sebaceous gland size and consequently sebum secretion (Johnson).

In this review, we have focused on the more widespread topical application of topical antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole and ciclopirox, which are available as ointments, creams, gels and shampoos (Gupta; Shuster).

How the intervention might work

Based on the concept that Malassezia yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis, antifungals have long been proposed as treatment that confers the same benefits as steroids but lacks associated adverse effects (Gupta). Antifungals can lead to inhibition of fungal growth, mainly by interaction with the fungal cell membrane through inhibition of sterol synthesis or inhibition of the synthesis of cell walls (Kathiravan). In accordance with their chemical structure, antifungals are usually divided into azole-based antifungals such as ketoconazole, allylamines such as terbinafine, benzylamines such as butenafine and hydroxypyridones such as ciclopirox (Ghannoum). Other drugs such as selenium sulphide or herbal agents and natural products such as honey have also been shown to influence fungal growth, but their mechanism of action is not clear (Gupta). In this review, we have selectively included herbal extracts that have well-documented antifungal properties.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^cc6be193]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Development of strategies to preserve and expand functional human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ex vivo before transplantation has been a long-standing goal in the field of hematology to improve cell therapy applications. Umbilical cord blood (CB) is an abundant and readily available stem cell source for transplantation, however, the relatively low number of hematopoietic stem- and progenitor-cells (HSPCs) in a typical CB unit currently limits the use of CB to hematopoietic cell transplantation of pediatric patients. Successful ex vivo expansion of HSPCs would increase the utility of CB and allow transplantation also to adult patients. Moreover, gene-therapy applications and emerging gene-editing strategies for therapeutic targeting of HSCs would greatly benefit from robust culture conditions in which HSCs are preserved and ideally also expanded. Finally, it is likely that efforts to generate transplantable HSCs from pluripotent stem cells would be facilitated if conditions were established that allowed for the propagation of any HSCs generated.

To date, several strategies for HSC expansion have shown promising potential, including the targeting of specific signaling pathways or epigenetic factors. Moreover, the negative impact of proinflammatory signaling and oxidative stress on HSC maintenance and function has been demonstrated in other studies, as well as the importance of intracellular calcium and copper homeostasis. Altogether, these efforts have led to a deeper understanding of the intricate complexity of gene regulation, signaling pathways, and metabolic networks in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation balance of HSCs.

To gain further insights into the processes governing the maintenance and propagation of human HSCs in culture, we screened several annotated small molecule libraries in primary human CB-derived HSPCs. We identified a top candidate, ciclopirox ethanolamine (CPX), which is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tropical fungal infections and a chelator of intracellular iron. In this report, we show that CPX by reducing the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP), triggers proliferative and metabolic alterations that preserves HSC integrity and protects the stem cell pool from exhaustion during culture.

### Chemical genomic analysis reveals the interplay between iron chelation, zinc homeostasis, and retromer function in the bioactivity of an ethanol adduct of the feijoa fruit-derived ellagitannin vescalagin [^718021f4]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to determine the mechanism of action of EtOH-vescalagin. Using unbiased genome-wide Bar-seq analysis, we identified yeast strains lacking genes in iron metabolism, zinc metabolism, retromer function, or mitochondrial function were hypersensitive to EtOH-vescalagin. The EtOH-vescalagin treatment resulted in iron deficiency in the cell based on sensitivity of iron transporter deletion strains, upregulation of iron transporters, rescued growth reduction with iron supplementation, and measurements of intracellular iron. Subsequent to iron chelation, there was an increase in intracellular zinc, and each individual subunit in the Vps26//retromer complex was required for the iron and zinc homeostatic mechanisms of EtOH-vescalagin.

Our study is the first report for iron chelation as a mechanism for vescalagin or EtOH-vescalagin. Since we showed that EtOH-vescalagin chelated iron in a cell-free assay and that the iron chelation activity of EtOH-vescalagin was indistinguishable from the known extracellular iron chelator BPS, we propose that EtOH-vescalagin chelates iron in the media, thus inducing the cellular response to iron deficiency. Iron chelation by plant polyphenols is an established mechanism underlying a range of bioactivities. Relative to our study where we demonstrated antifungal activity of EtOH-vescalagin via growth inhibition of yeast, iron chelation has been proposed as a mechanism for antifungal treatment where defects in the high-affinity iron uptake system significantly enhanced antifungal activity of clinically approved antifungal drugs against pathogenic fungi including C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. This was consistently demonstrated with various iron-chelating agents such as EDTA, deferoxamine, deferiprone, deferasirox, ciclopirox olamine, and lactoferrin. Our results may provide mechanistic insight into the hypothesis that vescalagin in oak heartwood is one of the compounds combating the growth of pathogenic fungi in casks.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Revisiting the role of endogenous STAT3 in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells [^dbf73bfc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Novel treatment options for human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers are urgently required. The oncogenic transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is considered to be constitutively active in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells and essential for their proliferation. Moreover, STAT3 was reported to undergo mutually stimulatory interactions with the HPV E6/E7 oncogenes. Thus, inhibiting STAT3 in HPV-positive cancer cells is under discussion to provide a powerful novel therapeutic strategy. We here show that the antifungal drug ciclopirox destabilizes the STAT3 protein by acting as an iron chelator. However, by exploring the functional consequences of STAT3 inhibition in HPV-positive cancer cells, we obtained several unexpected results. Chemical STAT3 inhibitors heterogeneously affect cervical cancer cell proliferation and those which act antiproliferative also block the growth of STAT3 knockout cells, indicating induction of off-target effects. In contrast to several chemical inhibitors, genetic inhibition of STAT3 expression by either RNA interference or the CRISPR/Cas9 method does not appreciably affect cervical cancer cell proliferation. Transcriptome analyses indicate that blocking STAT3 expression in HPV-positive cancer cells has very limited effects on putative STAT3 target genes. Although the targeted inhibition of specific growth-promoting signaling pathways leads to a feedback activation of STAT3 in cervical cancer cells via Janus kinase 1/2, this does not lead to treatment resistance. Moreover, we did not obtain experimental evidence for a STAT3-linked activation of HPV E6/E7 oncogene expression or, vice versa, an E6/E7-dependent activation of STAT3, at endogenous conditions in cervical cancer cells. Collectively, these findings question the essential role of STAT3 in cervical cancer cell proliferation and the strategy to inhibit STAT3 in these cells for therapeutic purposes.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^e9f3f9a0]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron is present as a cofactor in a plethora of proteins, such as iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins and heme-containing proteins, because of its facile ability to undergo redox cycling between ferric (Fe³⁺) and ferrous ion (Fe²⁺), and it, therefore, plays a vital role in mitochondrial respiratory complexes. In agreement with this, we found that CPX treatment affect the mitochondrial respiratory potential of HSCs mainly reducing their spare respiratory capacity. Previously, Fryknäs et al also found that iron chelation in quiescent tumor cells reduced the mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity leaving limited metabolic plasticity for cancer cells.

Therefore, a possible scenario is that iron chelation induced by CPX delays the DNA replication as a result of the impact of iron deprivation on iron-dependent enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase. This is in line with altered pyrimidine and purine metabolites in our metabolome analysis, which may result in a delayed transition through the cell cycle. In addition, CPX treatment limited the mitochondrial respiratory potential of HSCs and may, thereby, introduce a road-block for the transition of quiescent HSCs toward the proliferation state that relies mainly on high oxidative energy consumption. Therefore, CPX treatment preserves the HSC state and protects the stem cell pool from exhaustion during culture. This finding was strongly supported by CPX-mediated metabolomic changes, as evidenced by reduced level of several amino acids, alerted protein synthesis, and reduced TCA cycle activity; increased level of polyamines including spermidine and spermine is in line with a previously reported connection between polyamine levels and stemness. In addition, we observe a reduction in S1P and other sphingolipid metabolites, which were previously reported to regulate HSCs function. Sphingolipid composition was recently reported to differ along the human hematopoietic hierarchy, and sphingolipid modulation through inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis led to an increase in functional LT-HSCs. Collectively, we report here a previously unknown ability of CPX on preserving the immature state of human HSCs during ex vivo culture. The crucial role of iron homeostasis for human HSCs was reported recently; however, to our knowledge, here we show for the first time the impact of LIP deprivation on CB-HSC maintenance during ex vivo culture. To achieve the optimal expansion of CB-HSPCs for successful transplantation, it is of great importance to identify conditions that can robustly amplify short-term progenitor cells while maintaining and/or expanding long-term HSCs to promote hematopoietic recovery. Although our finding indicates that CPX preferentially supports the maintenance of long-term regenerative activity of cultured HSCs, it may not be sufficient in the context of robust expansion of CB-HSPCs for transplantation purposes. However, CPX in combination with previously identified HSC expansion molecules such as SR1, P38 inhibitors, and UM171 resulted in an additional increase in the number of phenotypic HSPCs, and it will be of interest to further investigate and rigorously test combinations of CPX with these molecules for expansion of CB-HSPCs.

### Mycological considerations in the topical treatment of superficial fungal infections [^7f7599e3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichophyton rubrum remains the most common pathogenic dermatophyte in the United States, Europe, and industrialized Asia, although other species are predminant elsewhere. Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic yeast, with other species occasionally encountered. Just a few of the 14 described species of Malassezia cause pityriasis versicolor worldwide. FDA approval does not always accurately reflect the potential utility of any given topical antifungal agent. Azole, hydroxypyridone, and allylamine agents are beneficial in the management of dermatophytosis; however, the allylamines may lead to faster symptom resolution and a higher degree of sustained response. Although in actual clinical use the allylamines have all shown some activity against superficial cutaneous candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor, the azole agents remain drugs of choice. Ciclopirox is an excellent broad-spectrum antifungal agent. Optimal topical therapy for superficial fungal infections cannot yet be reliably based upon in-vitro laboratory determination of sensitivity. Inherent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties possessed by some antifungal agents may be exploited for clinical purposes. Candida species may be azole-insensitive due to efflux pumps or an altered target enzyme. So-called "antifungal resistance" of dermatophyets is actually due to poor patient adherence (either in dosing or treatment duration), or to reinfection.

### High-throughput small molecule screen identifies inhibitors of microsporidia invasion and proliferation in C. elegans [^49dcf66f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Compound structures and mechanisms.

A Structures of compounds containing a quinone moiety (circled in red) that were identified in the initial screen as inhibitors of microsporidia infection. B Microsporidia infection model depicting the stages at which various microsporidia inhibitors act. Two protease inhibitors and four quinone-derivatives were shown to act directly on N. parisii spores to prevent spore firing and subsequent invasion of sporoplasms. Fumagillin and dexrazoxane act after invasion has occurred, inhibiting proliferation of sporoplasms and meronts, ultimately reducing parasite burden and preventing the production of microsporidia spores. Figure made using Biorender.com.

Dexrazoxane is an FDA-approved drug for the prevention of cardiomyopathies caused by chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer patients. Dexrazoxane can be hydrolyzed into a structure that is similar to the metal ion chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and is thought to work by reducing the amount of iron complexed with anthracycline chemotherapeutics, thus reducing the number of superoxide radicals formed by such interactions. Iron is an important metabolite for microsporidia proliferation. Honey bees infected with N. ceranae have reduced levels of iron and the growth of E. cuniculi in macrophages was promoted with the addition of iron and inhibited upon addition of an iron chelator. Given the established role of dexrazoxane as an iron chelator, it seemed likely that its mechanism as an anti-microsporidial might involve sequestering iron away from sporoplasms and meronts, thus depriving them of a crucial resource required for growth and infection progression. However, our results do not support this. Neither treatment with the iron chelator BP, nor iron supplementation using FAC, had any significant effect on N. parisii infection. Additionally, dexrazoxane still exhibited strong anti-microsporidial effects when C. elegans were exposed to N. parisii in a high iron environment. These results suggest that the anti-microsporidial properties of dexrazoxane are unlikely to be the result of drug-induced alterations in iron homeostasis. This is contrast to lethality of C. elegans caused by the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can be reversed by treatment with the iron chelator ciclopirox olamine, which was included in our screen, but was not observed to have an effect against N. parisii. The iron chelator deferoxamine, which inhibits E. cuniculi in macrophages, was also included in our screen, but not observed to have activity against N. parisii. A second proposed mechanism for dexrazoxane is the inhibition of topoisomerase II. However, several topoisomerase II inhibitors that have previously been used with C. elegans (etoposide, teniposide, dactinomycin, and amsacrine), were included in our initial screen, but were not observed to have activity against N. parisii. The mechanism of action of dexrazoxane in blocking N. parisii proliferation thus remains elusive. We found that dexrazoxane could prevent microsporidia proliferation, at a concentration that has no significant effect on host fitness. However, we do observe a trend towards host toxicity at higher concentrations. Additional analogs of dexrazoxane have been generated and testing dexrazoxane analogs for host toxicity and their ability to inhibit microsporidia could identify more selective compounds.

Pharmacokinetics

As demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man, ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine. Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide. After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug (14C-ciclopirox) to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration. Ninety-four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides. Thus, glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound.

Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months. Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment. In this study, ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12–80 ng/mL. Based on urinary data, mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was < 5% of the applied dose. One month after cessation of treatment, serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection.

In two vehicle-controlled trials, patients applied Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), to all toenails and affected fingernails. Out of a total of 66 randomly selected patients on active treatment, 24 had detectable serum ciclopirox concentrations at some point during the dosing interval (range 10.0–24.6 ng/mL). It should be noted that eleven of these 24 patients took concomitant medication containing ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine cream, 0.77%.

The penetration of the Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was evaluated in an in vitro investigation. Radiolabeled ciclopirox applied once to onychomycotic toenails that were avulsed demonstrated penetration up to a depth of approximately 0.4 mm. As expected, nail plate concentrations decreased as a function of nail depth. The clinical significance of these findings in nail plates is unknown. Nail bed concentrations were not determined.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^85bc250a]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we developed and optimized a high content small molecule screen applied to primary human HSPCs. We show that CD90 expression directly correlates with the long-term repopulating activity of cultured CB-derived HSPCs and thus constitutes a valuable indicator of HSC content in cultured cells. From the screen, we identified CPX as a novel candidate regulator of human HSCs that promotes the ex vivo maintenance of cultured HSCs.

CPX is a hydroxypyridone derivative and an FDA-approved drug for the topical treatment of a wide range of fungal infections. CPX has been shown to chelate intracellular iron and, thereby, affect iron-dependent proteins and cellular processes. Iron chelators have profound antileukemic activity as demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Oral administration of CPX was shown to prevent primary acute myeloid leukemia cell engraftment in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, possibly by targeting leukemic stem cells. However, a role of CPX in regulation of normal HSCs has not been described previously.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^cd56e704]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Further analysis of the global gene expression data from CPX-treated cells showed an enrichment of genes responsible for iron transport and uptake (supplemental Figure 5 E; supplemental Table 7), which is in agreement with the well-known iron chelation activity of CPX and an indication of a compensatory responses to restore the intracellular iron concentration. In line with this observation, we detected an upregulation of transferrin receptor (TFRC/CD71) in CD34 + CD90 + cells after 6 days of treatment with CPX (Figure 3 A). To assess whether CPX directly alters iron homeostasis of CB-HSPCs, we quantified free intracellular iron levels by staining CD34 + cells with the cell permeable dye, Calcein-AM, whose fluorescent activity is quenched upon binding intracellular iron. We detected a significant increase in calcein fluorescence as early as 1 hour after CPX treatment, demonstrating that CPX reduces the cytoplasmic LIP (Figure 3 B). To assess whether CPX-dependent modulation of iron homeostasis was responsible for the enhanced stem cell output, we pretreated CB-CD34 + cells with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) for 1 hour before CPX treatment. We found that iron preloading, although not affecting control cells, completely reverted the CPX-induced increase of CD34 + CD90 + cell number (Figure 3 C). In addition, iron preloading led to a substantial reduction in the number of CD90 + CD71 + cells after 6 days (supplemental Figure 5 F). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the main biological effects of CPX in HSCs are mediated by its iron chelation function.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^b5783a9f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Types of interventions

We included studies that had evaluated the effectiveness of topical antifungal drugs for seborrhoeic dermatitis, as well as studies that had compared interventions according to either of the following two schedules.

Any topical antifungal-based treatment versus no treatment or placebo.
Any topical antifungal-based treatment versus another treatment.

We defined antifungal drugs as drugs with an established antifungal mode of action. According to Gupta, this included the following drug classes.

Imidazoles: bifonazole, climbazole, ketoconazole, miconazole.
Triazoles: fluconazole.
Allylamines: terbinafine.
Benzylamines: butenafine.
Hydroxypyrones: ciclopirox.

We found no consensus among study authors on how antifungal drugs were defined for use in trials. Therefore we included all studies in which study authors presented evidence that the drug had antifungal properties. We also included two herbal treatments with documented antifungal properties.

We excluded studies or treatment arms of studies that used a combination of antifungals and other drugs as the intervention, such as a combination of antifungals and steroids, because it would be unclear which of the active agents accounts for a given outcome and to what extent.

For topical applications, it is difficult to capture dose, as it is unclear how much a patient will need to apply to the skin. The only information available in studies was the strength of the drug given as a percentage and the frequency of application per day and per week. To calculate a dose that is comparable across studies, we multiplied the percentage by the frequency per day by the frequency per week. For example, 2% ketoconazole applied twice daily seven days a week would add up to 28 percentage points per week (%/wk).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Percentage of persons who had clinical resolution (clearance) of all symptoms based on physician assessment.
Quality of life measured with any validated quality of life assessment index.

Secondary outcomes

Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus and scaling, measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment.
Side effects/intolerance to treatment.
Percentage of persons treated who comply with treatment regimens.
The longest rash-free period.

Timing of outcomes

Treatment effects were measured and combined at:

four weeks or less following commencement of treatment (short-term); and
more than four weeks following commencement of treatment (long-term).

### Iron chelation inhibits mTORC1 signaling involving activation of AMPK and REDD1 / bnip3 pathways [^9f4df961]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron is an essential element involved in many human physiological processes. Iron chelators, such as deferoxamine (DFO, also Desferal) and deferasirox (Exjade), have been used to treat iron overload diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that excessive iron contributes to tumor initiation, growth, microenvironment, and metastasis. Studies have found that expression levels of iron regulating proteins, such as transferrin receptor are altered in cancer cells, leading to increased intracellular iron level. Thus, iron chelators have been investigated as anticancer agents.

DFO was first tested in humans to treat leukemia and neuroblastoma, but with poor cell membrane permeability. Recently, iron chelators with high cell permeability have been identified and designed, such as CPX (ciclopirox olamine) and Dp44mT. CPX is an off-patent antifungal drug for topical use, and Dp44mT is a new iron chelator with high cell membrane permeability. The anticancer effect of iron chelation is closely related to intracellular iron level decrease, induction of ROS (reactive oxygen species), cell cycle arrest, cell death, and tumor suppressor gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying iron chelation-induced anticancer effect are not fully understood. Apart from the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the alteration in the MAPK pathway, little is known about the effect of iron chelation on other signaling pathways in cancer cells. mTOR responds to oxygen, energy, and oxidative stresses, which are associated with intracellular iron level. This study was set to determine whether and how iron chelation inhibits mTOR signaling.

### Ciclopirox ethanolamine preserves the immature state of human HSCs by mediating intracellular iron content [^cf666f34]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

CPX enhances the long-term engraftment capacity of ex vivo cultured HSPCs

To evaluate the functional capability of CPX-treated cells, we cultured CD34 + cells in presence of CPX or DMSO for 6 days and then assayed for colony-forming ability using methylcellulose medium. CPX-treated cells generated similar numbers of myeloid colonies (CFU-GM) and showed a trend toward higher numbers of erythroid colonies (BFU-E) than control condition, whereas immature multilineage colonies (CFU-GEMM) were detected exclusively in the CPX-treated cultures (supplemental Figure 3 A). This indicates that CPX treatment may preferentially support the more immature progenitor populations.

Next, we transplanted the cultured output of 30 000 initially seeded CB-CD34 + cells into sublethally irradiated NSG mice after 6 days culture in the presence or absence of CPX in 2 separate experiments with independent batches of pooled Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) from multiple units (Figure 2 A). Mice that underwent transplantation with CPX-treated cells showed similar short-term (6 weeks) human engraftment compared with controls but displayed significantly higher engraftment 16 weeks after transplantation in peripheral blood (Figure 2 B). When bone marrow was analyzed after 16 weeks, many mice displayed saturating engraftment levels (> 40%), but there was still a clear trend toward higher engraftment from the CPX-treated cells in 1 experiment (Exp 1, Figure 2 C) and significantly higher chimerism levels in a subsequent experiment (Exp 2, Figure 2 C). The engrafted cells contributed to both myeloid and lymphoid lineages (Figure 2 D-E). In order to further evaluate the impact of CPX treatment on long-term HSC repopulation ability, we transplanted BM from engrafted primary recipients into secondary NSG recipients. Eighteen weeks after transplant, we observed significantly better engraftment in the PB of the CPX group and a similar trend in BM engraftment of the secondary recipients (Figure 2 F-G). Altogether, our data suggest that CPX enhances the ex vivo maintenance of functional long-term repopulating HSCs.

Results

A small molecule screen identifies CPX as a candidate modifier of human HSCs ex vivo

To identify modifiers of human HSCs ex vivo, we first set out to define relevant phenotypic markers of CB-derived HSCs during culture as there is a dissociation between stem cell phenotype and function upon culture. We monitored the expression of several stemness-related markersin cultures of bulk CD34 + cells (supplemental Figure 1 A), as well as HSC-enriched CD34 + CD38 lo CD90 + CD45RA – cells (supplemental Figure 1 B) and highly purified CD34 + CD38 – CD90 + CD45RA – CD49f + cells (supplemental Figure 1 C). Cells were grown in the presence or absence of the p38α inhibitor Ly2228820 (Ly) that was previously reported to enhance HSC propagation in vitro. Although lack of expression of both CD38 and CD45RA defines functional HSCs in freshly isolated cells, these markers are globally downregulated upon culture and not useful to further enrich HSCs from cultured cells (supplemental Figure 1 A-C). Similarly, CD49f expression, which positively marks uncultured functional HSCs, was only detected in nontransplantable CD34 lo/– cells upon culture. However, both CD133and, most notably, CD90 distinctively separated the CD34 + population in all culture conditions (supplemental Figure 1 A-C). Although CD133 marked a large portion (> 1 out of 3) of the CD34 + cells, CD90 was expressed on a discrete subset, indicating that it might define a highly enriched HSC population. Indeed, we detected robust lymph-myeloid long-term repopulating activity from the CD34 + CD90 + population but not from up to 10-fold higher doses of CD34 + CD90 - cells, regardless of starting cell population, culture time, or presence of the p38 inhibitor (supplemental Figure 1 D-H). By contrast, > 95% of progenitor cells with CFC potential were contained in the CD34 + CD90 – population (supplemental Figure 1 I-J). Thus, in cultured CB cells, CD90 expression selectively marks the functional HSC pool and dissociates it from the vast majority of progenitor cells, which is in agreement with other studies.

### Ototoxic effect of topical ciclopirox as an antimycotic preparation [^1f18a8af]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the ototoxicity of ciclopirox-containing solution as an otologic preparation for the treatment of otomycosis.

Background

Ciclopirox is a synthetic antimycotic agent available in a variety of formulations to treat superficial fungal infections. Ciclopirox has demonstrated both fungicidal and fungistatic activity in vitro against a broad spectrum of pathogenic fungi. It also possesses a broad-spectrum antibacterial properties, anti-inflammatory, and antiedema effect. The ototoxic effect of ciclopirox-containing solutions has not been known, so the current study was designed to observe the ototoxic effect of this solution experimentally.

Materials and Methods

Experiments were performed in 22 young male albino guinea pigs (weight, 450–550 g). The 10 animals in the experimental group received ciclopirox solution, and the control group was divided into two groups of six animals each. The first group received saline solution (negative control) and the second received gentamicin (40 mg/mL; ototoxic control). Under general anesthesia, pretreatment auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from the right ears were obtained from the animals in all groups. The right tympanic membranes were totally perforated, and a small piece of Gelfoam was applied to the middle ear directly to the round window membrane. Ear solutions were applied through transcanal approach to the middle ear twice a day in 2 weeks. Twenty-two animals of perforated tympanic membrane were observed during a 2-week period. Posttreatment ABRs were obtained in all groups in a week after the last administration.

Results

Baseline ABR results were normal in right ears of all animals tested. Animals undergoing placement of Gelfoam with either ciclopirox solution or saline in the middle ear showed no changes in the ABR threshold. The gentamicin group showed a significant change in the ABR threshold.

Conclusion

In the guinea pig, when applied topically to the middle ear, ciclopirox does not cause a reduction in the ABR threshold. Because its safety has not yet been confirmed in patients, caution should be observed when prescribing this agent.

### Topical ciclosporin in the treatment of ocular surface disorders [^f959a152]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence suggests that inflammation is the key factor in the pathogenesis of various ocular surface diseases, with a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors. Management of these conditions is often challenging. Topical corticosteroids, with their associated side effects, are the mainstay of current treatments for patients with vision threatening disease. Ciclosporin A is an immunomodulator that specifically inhibits T lymphocyte proliferation. Recently, a topical ciclosporin preparation was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and became available for use in ophthalmology. Given the increasing use of ciclosporin eye drops, the goal of this article is to provide the reader with an overview of the well established uses of ciclosporin and to help refine the questions that should be addressed by future investigations.

### A multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans [^8ca59184]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent. This open-label study investigated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans (C. albicans). Forty-four male and female subjects aged 6 to 29 months were included in the study. Study medication was applied topically to the affected diaper area twice daily for 1 week. Subjects were clinically evaluated at baseline and days 3, 7, and 14 (7 days post-treatment). Safety and efficacy variables included adverse events, mycological culture studies, KOH tests, Severity Scores, and Global Evaluation of Clinical Response. All adverse events were mild to moderate and considered not related to the study medication. Treatment provided statistically significant improvement (P < .05) for both the rate of mycological cure and reduction of Severity Score at each time point compared with baseline. Ciclopirox was safe and effective in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to C. albicans.

### A host defense peptide mimetic, brilacidin, potentiates caspofungin antifungal activity against human pathogenic fungi [^c5ab8fb9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Identification of a host defense peptide mimetic, BRI, as a CAS synergizer

To identify compounds that can enhance or synergize with CAS activity against A. fumigatus, we used the Minimal Effective Concentration (MEC) assay to screen the fungus susceptibility to four chemical drug libraries: (i) the COVID Box (containing 160 compounds, see); (ii) the Pandemic Response Box (containing 400 compounds, see); (iii) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical collection (NCC) (containing 727 compounds; see); and (iv) the epigenetic probe library (containing 115 compounds, see). In total, two methods were employed to assess 1402 compounds by using a combination of 0.2 µg/mL of CAS (a concentration below the MEC; MEC of CAS is 0.25 µg/mL) and up to 20 µM of each compound compared to the effect on growth of A. fumigatus of each drug alone. First, we assessed growth by two independent rounds of visual inspection and selected 17 compounds that could inhibit A. fumigatus growth. Second, A. fumigatus growth in the presence of CAS 0.2 µg/mL alone, each of these 17 compounds at 20 µM alone, and a combination of each of these compounds from 0.6 to 20 µM plus CAS 0.2 µg/mL was quantified by using Alamar blue (Fig. 1a). Based on this assay we defined enhancers as the compounds that alone could inhibit over 30% of A. fumigatus metabolic activity but in combination with CAS inhibited even more, while synergizers were defined as compounds which alone inhibited < 30% of the fungal metabolic activity but in combination with CAS inhibited > 30% (for further definitions and applications of synergizers and enhancers, see –.). Five compounds were classified as enhancers (Fig. 1a): (i) chlormidazole and (ii) ravuconazole (both inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis), (iii) 5-fluorocytosin (that inhibits the RNA and DNA biosynthesis), (iv) ciclopirox; it is thought to act through the chelation of Fe³⁺ and Al³⁺, polyvalent metal cations, and (v) MMV1593544 (a possible antiviral compound that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro). Twelve compounds were classified as synergizers (Fig. 1a, b): (i) toremifene (a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative used as an antitumor drug that appears to bind to the estrogen receptors competing with estradiol), (ii) brilacidin; a compound that acts as a mimetic of host defense peptides, (iii) MMV1634399 (a quinoline anti-malarial), (iv) Diiodoemodin or MMV1581545 (an anti-bacterial emodin derivative), (v) PPTN (a potent, high-affinity, competitive and highly selective nucleotide-sugar-activated P2Y14 receptor antagonist), (vi) triclopidine (a prodrug that is metabolized to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation;), (vii) loxoprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that acts as a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzymes, which are responsible for the formation of various biologically active pain, fever, and inflammatory mediators;), (viii) regorafenib (a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment;), (ix) OSU 03012 (a potent inhibitor of recombinant phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1), (x) MMV1782211 (an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease);, (xi) MMV1782350 and (xii) MMV1782097 (two uncharacterized antivirals).

The management of onychomycosis using topical agents has improved with the introduction of ciclopirox and amorolfine nail lacquers; other topical agents may be less effective. The combination of a nail lacquer with an oral antifungal agent may further improve efficacy rates in certain clinical presentations (eg, among those individuals with severe onychomycosis). Topical agents have a favorable adverse events profile. Further studies are required on the treatment of onychomycosis with nail lacquers.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^f0f55ef6]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

The following in vitro genotoxicity tests were conducted with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer): Ames Salmonella test (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in the rat hepatocytes (negative); cell transformation assay in BALB/c3T3 cell assay (positive). The positive response of the lacquer formulation in the BALB/c3T3 test was attributed to its butyl monoester of poly [methylvinyl ether/maleic acid] resin component (Gantrez®ES-435), which also tested positive in this test. The cell transformation assay may have been confounded because of the film-forming nature of the resin. Gantrez®ES-435 tested nonmutagenic in both the in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay with or without activation and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes.

Oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 3.85 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day [equivalent to approximately 1.4 times the potential exposure at the maximum recommended human topical dose (MRHTD)] did not reveal any specific effects on fertility or other reproductive parameters. MRHTD (mg/m²) is based on the assumption of 100% systemic absorption of 27.12 mg ciclopirox (~340 mg Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer)) that will cover all the fingernails and toenails including 5 mm proximal and lateral fold area plus onycholysis to a maximal extent of 50%.

Ciclopirox versus Quassia amara

Primary outcomes

Participants without complete resolution

One trial (Diehl) compared the effects of ciclopirox versus Quassia amara in inducing complete clearance of seborrhoeic dermatitis rash. Short-term (up to four weeks) assessment showed that although failure to achieve complete resolution was less for Quassia amara, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.78) (Analysis 21.1). Long-term (more than four weeks) assessment yielded less failed clearance of rashes in participants placed on Quassia amara, and the difference was statistically significant (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.19) (Analysis 21.2).

Ciclopirox (higher dose) versus ciclopirox (lower dose)

Primary outcomes

Participants without complete resolution

Two studies (Altmeyer; Shuster) compared the effects of higher doses of treatment using ciclopirox versus lower doses of the same drug. The two studies were analysed separately because they determined the compared dosages using different methods. Altmeyercompared ciclopirox 1% against ciclopirox 0.3% and ciclopirox 0.1%. We found that the larger dose resulted in better treatment effect more often than the lower doses, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76) (Analysis 20.1).

One study (Shuster) compared a twice-weekly application regimen of 1% ciclopirox versus a once-weekly application regimen. No statistically significant difference in induction of complete resolution was noted between the two regimens (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.0) (Analysis 20.1).

However, combining these studies (Altmeyer; Shuster) in a random-effects meta-analysis did not yield statistically significant differences in effects between high and low doses (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.13; I² = 79%) (Analysis 20.1).

No secondary outcomes were reported for this comparison.

Micoconazole was used in two studies that compared it versus steroids and versus a combination of shampoo and rinse, both for the scalp. The dose in one study was 2% twice daily, but the dose was unclear in the other study.

Zinc pyrithione

Zinc pyrithione was used in one study that compared it with ketoconazole. The dose used was 1% once daily for the scalp.

Quassia amara

One study evaluated the effect of Quassia amara, an extract reported to have antifungal properties, compared with ketoconazole 2%. We included this because it was listed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (USFDA).

Solanum chrysotrichum

This herbal extract was investigated in one study in which its mycological action was compared with that of ketoconazole. It is widely used in Mexico, and its antifungal action has been reported in some studies (Zamilpa).

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^c9e5dc71]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No carcinogenicity study was conducted with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), formulation. A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox (1% and 5% solutions in polyethylene glycol 400) in female mice dosed topically twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6-month drug-free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application sites.

In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application (~340 mg of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer)) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31 ± 28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications. This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7.7 and 23.1 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day.

The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in Ames Salmonella and E. coli assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, with and without metabolic activation (positive); gene mutation assay in the HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in human A549 cells (negative); and BALB/c3T3 cell transformation assay (negative). In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay, ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5,000 mg/kg.

### Blocking eIF5A modification in cervical cancer cells alters the expression of cancer-related genes and suppresses cell proliferation [^19569d3a]. Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cancer etiology is influenced by alterations in protein synthesis that are not fully understood. In this study, we took a novel approach to investigate the role of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A in human cervical cancers, where it is widely overexpressed. eIF5A contains the distinctive amino acid hypusine, which is formed by a posttranslational modification event requiring deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), an enzyme that can be inhibited by the drugs ciclopirox and deferiprone. We found that proliferation of cervical cancer cells can be blocked by DOHH inhibition with either of these pharmacologic agents, as well as by RNA interference-mediated silencing of eIF5A, DOHH, or another enzyme in the hypusine pathway. Proteomic and RNA analyses in HeLa cervical cancer cells identified two groups of proteins in addition to eIF5A that were coordinately affected by ciclopirox and deferiprone. Group 1 proteins (Hsp27, NM23, and DJ-1) were downregulated at the translational level, whereas group 2 proteins (TrpRS and PRDX2) were upregulated at the mRNA level. Further investigations confirmed that eIF5A and DOHH are required for Hsp27 expression in cervical cancer cells and for regulation of its key target IκB and hence NF-κB. Our results argue that mature eIF5A controls a translational network of cancer-driving genes, termed the eIF5A regulon, at the levels of mRNA abundance and translation. In coordinating cell proliferation, the eIF5A regulon can be modulated by drugs such as ciclopirox or deferiprone, which might be repositioned to control cancer cell growth.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^6607795f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^e296266b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Ketoconazole was more effective than placebo at four weeks of follow-up and possibly at three months of follow-up, but few longer-term studies have been conducted. Evidence for this was of low quality. Evidence was insufficient to suggest a dose effect. The most often applied dose was 2%, but the frequency of application of treatments varied between studies from once or twice daily to once or three times weekly for varying lengths of time, and it is unclear which regimen works best.

Ketoconazole did not cause more side effects than were observed with placebo. Topical ketoconazole showed similar efficacy when compared with steroids, but steroids showed a two-fold greater risk of side effects than was seen with ketoconazole. Compared with other antifungals, we cannot say that ketoconazole consistently resulted in a more or less effective outcome because most of these comparisons involved single studies.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo but with a comparable incidence of side effects. Evidence was insufficient to reveal an effect of increased dose. Evidence was of moderate quality. Ciclopirox showed effects similar to those of ketoconazole. No comparisons of ciclopirox versus steroids were reported.

Bifonazaole was also found to be more effective than placebo.

Outome variables in this review were stratified according to site (scalp, face or scalp and face). Treatment outcomes were fairly consistent for ketoconazole and other antifungals across different application sites. Studies provided insufficient evidence that the mode of delivery accounted for consistent differences in treatment effect.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^86c0e1fb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients ages 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected 1 year after completion of the study from 24 patients. Mycologic cure, effective treatment, and complete cure were assessed, as well as adverse events and effect on quality of life. Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for 1 year remained clear. Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Antifungal activity, experimental infections and nail permeation of an innovative ciclopirox nail lacquer based on a water-soluble biopolymer [^cb0cf742]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

P-3051 is an innovative 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, based on hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) as a film-forming agent. The authors' aim was to investigate P-3051's in vitro antifungal activity, as well as its in vitro and in vivo nail permeation. The dilution susceptibility tests performed for Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) and Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P-3051, as percent of ciclopirox, was for both fungi ≤ 0.0015% (equivalent to a concentration of 15.6 mg/ ml). In the biological assay of in vitro nail permeation and fungal inhibition, the authors observed that P-3051 permeated well through bovine hoof membranes and produced dose-dependent inhibitory effects on dermatophyte, yeast and mold strains. Moreover, the inhibition effects were higher than those obtained by equal amounts of the ciclopirox reference nail lacquer. P-3051 and the reference showed the same protective activity in experimental infections with strains of dermatophytes isolated from clinical samples. The amount of ciclopirox remained in cut fingernails washed six hours after in vivo application of P-3051 ranged between 18 and 35% of the applied dose. After in vitro application to cut human nails, 40–50% of the applied ciclopirox penetrated during the first six hours, independent of nails being infected or uninfected, intact or filed. In both experiments, the concentration of ciclopirox is largely higher (three to four orders of magnitude) than the MICs for nail pathogens.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We found studies on the effects of ketoconazole, bifonazole, metronidazole, clotrimazole and ciclopirox in alleviating symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Ketoconazole led to a lower incidence of failure to achieve complete resolution than was seen with placebo, but the results were statistically heterogeneous and could not be explained by subgroup analyses of dose, mode of delivery nor conflict of interest. Evidence was considered to be of moderate or low quality.

Treatment with ketoconazole yielded less failure of total rash clearance than was observed with placebo. Evidence for this was of low quality. Ketoconazole reduced erythema and scaling better than placebo did, but the two treatments had a comparable effect on pruritus. Participants taking ketoconazole had comparable risk of side effects across all reporting studies when compared with those given placebo.

Ketoconazole was less effective than steroids in yielding complete remission of rashes, but this finding was not statistically significant. Ketoconazole and steroids showed similar effects on improvement of erythema, pruritus and scaling symptoms. Statistical heterogeneity was high, and the evidence was judged to be of low quality. Participants taking ketoconazole had a 44% lower risk of side effects than those taking steroids.

Ketoconazole was comparable with ciclopirox in eliminating symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Evidence for this was graded as low. The two drugs were comparable when assessed in terms of symptom-specific outcomes. The incidence of side effects was comparable for the two drugs. Evidence for this was graded as low.

Compared with other antifungals, ketoconazole showed similar or slightly better effects.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo in yielding total clearance and in improving symptoms of erythema, pruritus and scaling. Occurrence of side effects was similar with the two treatments. Evidence was considered to be of moderate quality.

Bifonazole was better for all outcomes when compared with placebo, but statistically significant effects were seen most often in longer-term assessments of outcomes. Bifonazole was not as well tolerated as placebo.

Risk of bias in included studies was difficult to ascertain from reports on the articles, but in general was assumed to be high or at best unclear. Only 11 (Berger; Chosidow; Dreno; Dupuy; Langtry; Peter; Ratnavel; Seckin; Shuster; Swinyer; Unholzerof the 51 included articles fulfilled more than five of the 11 'risk of bias' criteria.

### Ciclopirox topical solution, 8% combined with oral terbinafine to treat onychomycosis: a randomized, evaluator-blinded study [^546834af]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This randomized, evaluator-blind, 3-arm parallel, comparator controlled, multicenter pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox nail lacquer topical solution, 8% in combination with oral terbinafine for the treatment of moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis (≥ 60% disease involvement of target nail and/or lunula/matrix involvement) (N = 73). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day, followed by 4 weeks of rest (no terbinafine), then another 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day (PLs); ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (PL12); or terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (L12). At week 48, mycological cure (negative microscopy and culture) occurred in 66.7% (14/21) (PL8), 70.4% (19/27) (PL12), and 56.0% (14/25) (L12) of patients confirmed dermatophyte positive, respectively (P: not significant). At this time point, effective cure (simultaneous mycological cure and ≥ 90% reduction in the disease area) was observed in 40.0% (8/20), 33.3% (8/24), and 34.8% (8/23) of patients, respectively (P: not significant). The PLs regimen was well-tolerated and had high compliance. The data suggest that combination therapy (PL8) may be an alternative regimen to continuous terbinafine (L12) in the treatment of moderate to severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^6adbc951]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Primary outcomes

Participants without complete resolution

Three studies (Chosidow; Diehl; Unholzer) compared effectiveness of ketoconazole versus that of ciclopirox. Among participants taking ciclopirox, 58% (133/228) did not have resolution of their seborrhoeic dermatitis compared with 63% (139/219) taking ketoconazole, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26; I² = 32%) (Analysis 4.1).

Chosidowand Diehlassessed comparative effectiveness of these treatments on long-term (more than four weeks) application and found that ciclopirox was better, with fewer participants exhibiting persistence of their seborrhoeic dermatitis again compared with ketoconazole, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; I² = 51%) (Analysis 4.2).

Secondary outcomes

Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, scaling measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment

Erythema score

One study (Shuttleworth) comparing ketoconazole and ciclopirox showed a decrease in erythema score on ciclopirox, but the effect was not statistically significant (MD -0.21, 95% CI -1.09 to 0.67) (Analysis 4.3).

Shuttleworthalso assessed long-term (more than four weeks) effectiveness of these treatments on erythema; results showed less erythema in the ketoconazole group, but the difference was not statistically significant (MD -0.28, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.60) (Analysis 4.4).

One trial (Ratnavel) reported treatment effect on SD erythema as a discrete outcome. Treatment effects were comparable between the ketoconazole group (98/150; 65%) and the ciclopirox group (105/150; 70%), and the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.09) (Analysis 4.5).

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

We located only one systematic review with a similar topic (Apasrawirote). Review authors searched only MEDLINE through PubMed and included only nine studies. They concluded that ketoconazole, metronidazole, bifonazole and ciclopirox had better effects on seborrhoeic dermatitis than were seen with placebo. Their conclusion is consistent with our findings that ketoconazole had greater consistency of effect upon comparison with other antifungals. Another systematic review (Kastarinen), which compared steroids versus azoles (mainly ketoconazole) for different treatment outcomes with seborrhoeic dermatitis, found steroids and ketoconazole to be of comparable efficacy.

### Six novel antimycotics [^c83115a4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We have reviewed six new antimycotic agents which have potential applications for human cutaneous and mucosal diseases. Information on these six drugs was obtained via an English language search of PubMed through the US National Library of Medicine. The antimycotic agents reviewed include rilopirox, lanoconazole, NND-502, butenafine, eberconazole and voriconazole. Rilopirox is a synthetic pyridone derivative, related to ciclopirox, with a fungicidal action. Rilopirox is a hydrophobic, topical agent with potential application in mucosal candida infections, tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Lanoconazole, an imidazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea infections and cutaneous candidiasis. The drug has been available for clinical use in Japan since 1994 and once-daily application to affected areas is recommended. In addition to its antifungal effect, animal data suggest that application of lanoconazole 0.5 or 1% cream is associated with accelerated wound healing. NND-502, a stereoselective analog of lanoconazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea pedis infection. NND-502 appears to be more effective in inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis than lanoconazole or bifonazole and clinical trials comparing these agents are awaited. Butenafine is the first member of a new class of antifungals, the benzylamine derivatives, and has been approved for topical use in Japan (since 1992) and the US. Butenafine has a potent fungicidal action and the drug has been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Butenafine has also been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory action after topical application and this may offer potential benefit over other topical antifungal agents. Eberconazole, an imidazole derivative, is a topical antifungal agent that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials in patients with tinea infections. Preliminary data indicate that the eberconazole is effective against some triazole-resistant yeasts such as Candida krusei and Candida glabrata. Voriconazole is an azole antifungal derivative of fluconazole. The drug is available in both oral and parenteral formulations. Oral voriconazole 200mg twice daily has been effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis and apergillosis in immunocompromised patients. After 12 weeks' treatment, a similar dosage of the drug elicited a positive response in 69% of nonimmunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis.

### Ciclopirox nail lacquer for the treatment of onychomycosis: an open non-comparative study [^201f5421]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a relatively common disease accounting for up to 50% of all nail disorders. Topical treatment, although less effective than systemic, is usually preferred by patients. Topical antifungal nail lacquers have been formulated to provide better delivery of the antifungal agent to the nail unit. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclopirox nail lacquer in the treatment of onychomycosis. Patients suffering from distal and lateral subungual toenail onychomycosis (DLSO) and lateral subungual onychomycosis (LSO) were treated by ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 9 months. Every week the nail lacquer was removed using acetone. Clinical nail status, KOH examination and mycological culture were recorded by the same investigator at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Thirty-six patients completed the 9-month regimen. Trichophyton rubrum was the most common pathogen. At the end of the study, good improvement to complete cure was observed in 13 patients (36%), 12 patients showed only mild to moderate improvement and 11 patients (31%) had no clinical improvement. No adverse effects were noted throughout the treatment period. Ciclopirox nail lacquer seems to be slightly more effective than other topical modalities and could be used in patients who cannot or do not want systemic treatment.

### Therapies for the treatment of onychomycosis [^36f61181]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Ciclopirox vs amorolfine: in vitro penetration into and permeation through human healthy nails of commercial nail lacquers [^0108b63b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

One of the pre-requisite for a successful topical antifungal drug indicated for onychomycosis is its bioavailability into the nail unit for achieving fungal eradication and clinical benefit. The aim of this study was to compare in vitro permeation/penetration through and into human nails of amorolfine (MRF) from a 5% anhydrous commercial formulation (Loceryl®) and ciclopirox (CPX) from the 8% aqueous formulation in hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) technology (Onytec®). The ability of the active ingredient to reach efficacious concentrations to inhibit nail pathogens was also evaluated. The amounts of drug permeated and retained in human healthy nails were determined using a suitably modified diffusion apparatus. HPLC analysis of the samples was performed. The HPCH-based CPX formulation demonstrated an efficient penetration into and permeation through the nail plates. Conversely, Loceryl® produced an amount of MRF permeated through and penetrated into the human toenails significantly lower than CPX. The evaluation of the efficacy index showed a higher potential efficacy of Onytec® with respect to Loceryl® on nail pathogens. The present work not only reinforced the previous results on different experimental substrates, but pointed out the superiority of HPCH-based Onytec® formulation containing CPX with respect to Loceryl® commercial product with MRF, both in terms of higher permeation through and penetration into the human nail, and for the efficacy towards the most common ungual pathogens.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^f8954f48]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### Efficacy of topical antifungals in the treatment of dermatophytosis: a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis involving 14 treatments [^55f33e10]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Considering that most randomized controlled trials compare antifungals with placebo instead of other antifungals, conventional meta-analysis is insufficient to define superiority between the evaluated strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis on antifungal treatments in the literature and shows all the evidence available at the time of the study.

Objective

To evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical antifungals used in dermatophytosis treatment, using mixed-treatment comparisons.

Evidence Acquisition

We performed a comprehensive search (up to July 31, 2012) for all entries in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Randomized controlled trials that compared topical antifungals with one another or with placebo in dermatophytosis treatment were selected for analysis. Methodologic quality of the trials was assessed using the Jadad scale. We excluded studies that scored less than 3 points. The outcomes evaluated were mycologic cure at the end of treatment and sustained cure. A random-effects Bayesian mixed-treatment comparisons model was applied to combine placebo-controlled and direct topical antifungals comparison trials. RESULTS Pooled data of the 65 trials identified did not show any statistically significant differences among the antifungals concerning the outcome of mycologic cure at the end of treatment. Regarding the sustained cure outcome, butenafine hydrochloride and terbinafine hydrochloride were significantly more efficacious than were clotrimazole, oxiconazole nitrate, and sertaconazole nitrate. Terbinafine also demonstrated statistical superiority when compared with ciclopirox (ciclopiroxolamine), and naftifine hydrochloride showed better response compared with oxiconazole. No inconsistency was detected in the network of evidence for both outcomes, sustaining the validity of the mixed-treatment comparisons results.

Conclusions and Relevance

With the outcome mycologic cure at the end of treatment, there was no significant difference among the antifungals. Butenafine, naftifine, and terbinafine might be the best strategies for maintaining cured status. Because of the different costs of the antifungals, pharmacoeconomic analysis is required to identify the most efficient strategy for dermatophytosis management.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^b140d99a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### Fungal head and neck dermatitis: current understanding and management [^e9436c34]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

While topical antifungals may have lower penetration into Malassezia reservoirs (i.e. the hair follicle) and less compliance compared to systemic options, some evidence supports their use in HND. A DBPCT of HND patients showed significant improvement in investigator global assessment (IGA) score after 1 month of ciclopirox olamine cream applied twice daily (− 1.2 versus − 0.7 for placebo; P = 0.049) and a similar trend in EASI score (− 128.2 versus − 98.8 for placebo; P > 0.05). Efficacy was supported by rebound HND symptoms upon discontinuation of ciclopirox olamine resulting in worsened IGA (0.4 versus − 0.2 for placebo; P = 0.025) and EASI (37.7 versus 0.6 for placebo; P > 0.05) scores at 2 weeks. Notably, M. furfur isolates may be more drug tolerant to azoles and ciclopirox olamine than other Malassezia spp. Meanwhile, topical ketoconazole applied twice daily was observed to improve facial rashes refractory to dupilumab in AD patients. Another DBPCT found no difference between topical miconazole-hydrocortisone cream and ketoconazole shampoo versus hydrocortisone alone for head and neck AD. Since both groups showed improvement in this study, the effect of topical antifungals alone could not be ascertained. Notably, topical ketoconazole twice daily has also been observed to improve DAHND.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^2b729252]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.
