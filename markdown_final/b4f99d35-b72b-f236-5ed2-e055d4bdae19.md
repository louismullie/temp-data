## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why, in a perfectly competitive labor market, firms as a group must pay higher wages to obtain more workers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core supply-and-demand logic in a competitive labor market. Then, I should verify how wage-setting behavior differs between individual firms and the market as a whole. Next, I will examine the upward-sloping labor supply curve and its implications for marginal cost. After that, I should review empirical and modeling evidence that captures wage adjustment dynamics. Finally, I will evaluate the answer choices and select the best fit, while double-checking for common distractors that confuse micro versus market-level reasoning.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in a perfectly competitive labor market, wages are determined by the intersection of aggregate labor supply and aggregate labor demand, and individual firms are wage takers. This means that when the market demands more workers, the equilibrium wage must rise to induce additional labor supply, even though each firm is too small to influence the market wage on its own [^c2b6d163].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between firm-level and market-level behavior. At the firm level, a single competitive employer faces a perfectly elastic supply of labor at the market wage, so it can hire more workers at the going wage without raising pay. But at the market level, the aggregate labor supply curve is upward sloping, so more workers are forthcoming only at higher wages, which is why the market wage must rise when total labor demand increases [^c2b6d163].

> I will now examine the supply-side mechanism. The upward-sloping labor supply reflects that higher wages overcome opportunity costs of leisure, home production, and nonparticipation, and can draw workers from other sectors or regions. In modeling frameworks, when unemployment is low and firms collectively want to hire more, competition for available workers pushes requested wages upward, consistent with an upward-sloping supply response [^c2b6d163].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether empirical patterns align with this logic. Evidence from labor market studies shows that tighter local labor markets, lower unemployment, and greater competition for workers are associated with higher turnover and wage pressure, reinforcing that firms must bid up wages to attract additional workers when labor markets tighten, which mirrors the upward-sloping supply story at the market level [^251bdf92] [^0a512307].

> Next, I should review the answer choices carefully. Option C, "Firms must raise wages to attract more workers", best captures the market-level mechanism: collectively, firms face an upward-sloping supply curve, so obtaining more workers requires a higher equilibrium wage. Options A, D, E, F, G, I, and J either describe firm-level phenomena, noncompetitive settings, or effects that would lower wages rather than raise them, so they do not answer the question as posed [^c2b6d163].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Option H, "A decrease in the supply of labor available", might also explain higher wages, but that would be a supply-shift story rather than a demand-driven increase in quantity hired. The question is specifically about needing more workers at the existing supply curve, which pushes wages up along the supply curve rather than shifting it, so Option C remains the better fit for the scenario described [^c2b6d163].

> Let me reconsider the core logic to ensure internal consistency. In perfect competition, the market supply curve is upward sloping, so a rightward shift in aggregate labor demand increases both equilibrium employment and the equilibrium wage. Individual firms still hire at the market wage, but that market wage is now higher, which is precisely why the group of firms ends up paying more to secure additional workers [^c2b6d163].

---

In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms must pay higher wages to hire more workers because the **market labor supply curve is upward-sloping** [^c2b6d163]. As firms collectively increase demand, they move up the supply curve, so the equilibrium wage rises to induce more workers to supply labor. Individual firms are wage takers and must match the higher market wage to attract workers, even though each firm alone cannot influence the market wage [^c2b6d163]. This is a core implication of perfect competition: firms face an upward-sloping labor supply at the market level, even if their own labor supply appears perfectly elastic at the going wage [^c2b6d163].

---

## The upward-sloping labor supply curve

- **Market-level supply**: The aggregate labor supply curve slopes upward because higher wages attract more workers (more hours, entrants, or mobility) [^c2b6d163].
- **Individual firm vs market**: A single competitive firm faces a perfectly elastic supply at the market wage, but the market supply itself is upward-sloping, so when all firms hire more, the market wage must rise [^c2b6d163].
- **Equilibrium adjustment**: As market demand rises, the equilibrium moves up the supply curve, increasing both quantity of labor and the wage rate [^c2b6d163].

---

## Wage determination in perfect competition

- **Wage takers**: Firms are price takers in the labor market; they must pay the market wage to secure workers [^c2b6d163].
- **Marginal cost of labor**: For the market, the marginal cost of labor rises with quantity because higher wages are needed to draw more workers [^c2b6d163].
- **Profit maximization**: Firms hire until the marginal revenue product of labor equals the market wage, which rises as market demand increases [^c2b6d163].

---

## Evidence from economic models and empirical studies

Agent-based models show that when labor demand rises, **wages increase** to clear the market, reflecting the upward-sloping supply [^c2b6d163]. Empirical work also finds that **tighter labor markets** (lower unemployment) push wages up as firms compete for workers [^251bdf92].

---

## Implications for firms and workers

Firms face **higher labor costs** when expanding employment, which can squeeze margins or prompt substitution toward capital [^c2b6d163]. Workers benefit from **higher wages** and more opportunities as demand rises, though this depends on labor mobility and skills [^c487fd68].

---

## Factors influencing the slope of the labor supply curve

- **Labor mobility**: Greater mobility flattens the supply curve; less mobility steepens it.
- **Skill specificity**: Specialized skills can make supply steeper in the short run.
- **Institutional factors**: Unions, minimum wages, and regulations can alter supply responsiveness [^a2630e8a].

---

## Conclusion

Firms in a perfectly competitive labor market must pay higher wages to hire more workers because the **market labor supply is upward-sloping** [^c2b6d163]. As aggregate demand increases, the equilibrium wage rises, and individual firms must match this higher wage to attract workers, even though each firm is a wage taker [^c2b6d163].

Labor market

The labor market mechanisms are largely based on those introduced in ref.(More specifically, the Competitive regime was used.), but diverts with the important addition of the heterogeneous labor productivity of households. However, in contrast to ref. we introduce labor productivity heterogeneity across households, which leads to market mismatches as employers may not always hire the most productive workers available. To mitigate these mismatches and avoid unrealistic outcomes, labor demand smoothing mechanisms are introduced. Additionally, we redefine the minimum requested wageusing the minimum wagerather than the unemployment benefits U B t used in ref. The employment of households by producers is determined through the labor market matching process. Before this process starts, the total amount of labor demand and supply is established. Producers set their desired change in their labor stock while planning their production amount. Producers with positivewill try to hire workers, whereas the producers with negativewill fire excessive workers in their labor stock. After excessive workers were fired, a pool of job-seeking households is formed from unemployed households, and employed households that look for a better-paying job. The employees who were fired by firms that went bankrupt at the end of last period are also included in this pool.

Households have a requested wage level, which is based on their (recent) wage history, and if the household is currently employed. The requested wage is determined as follows:The requested wage for an employed jobseeker is thus by a fraction ε w ≥ 0 higher than its current wage. Unemployed jobseekers demand a lower satisfying wage. This wage is adapted according to the following updating rule:whereis the minimum wage set by the government. This mechanism allows for wages to adapt to market conditions. In the case of high unemployment, more households will revise their requested wage down, leading to a drop in the average wage level.

In the case of low unemployment, producers will hire more employed jobseekers, which will create upward pressure on the average wage level. Furthermore, each firm j sets a maximum offered wage.

### Global labor flow network reveals the hierarchical organization and dynamics of geo-industrial clusters [^14f42999]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Association with economic performance

If geo-industrial clusters can effectively capture both industrial and geographical proximity, can they serve as a useful framework to study the effects of strategic advantage on economic performance? The competition for highly desirable jobs implies that well-educated individuals who are equipped with strong skill sets would be attracted to the sectors and regions that can pay premium wages or rapidly growing ones that may in the future. Furthermore, the industries and regions that attract well-educated people are more likely to benefit from accumulated human capital and spillover effects –. Motivated by these insights as well as other studies on the effect of labor market integration and knowledge spillover within geo-industrial clusters –, we examine the labor flow of college-degree workers across regions, industries, and geo-industrial clusters.

We test how well the influx of educated labor correlates with financial performance when aggregated into different units of analysis. Focusing on the firms in the S&P 500 Index and a time window between 2011 and 2014, we compare their market capitalization growth — measured by the linear temporal trend of log-scaled market capitalization — to the labor flux growth — measured by the linear temporal trend of the log ratio of college-degree labor influx to outflux aggregated in each grouping (see Fig. 4 and Methods).

This is equal to the highest wage for which the producer does not make a loss based on the average level of labor productivity and the selling price. So, for consumer good producers andfor capital good producers.

The labor market matching then started with all these job-seeking households and labor-seeking producers. For each labor-seeking producer, a job-seeking queue is generated consisting of a random sample of job-seeking households. The effective labor amount each household offers is given by its productivity level and its labor amount as π i L i. The producer will then go down the queue and hire the household i if π i L i ≤ Δ L d until its labor demand is satisfied or the queue has run out of households. If π i, t L i, t > Δ L d but Δ L d > 0, the employer will look further in the queue for an employee with less offered labor supply.

Note that employers pay w i, t L i to employee i, which does not take into account the employee's productivity level π i. Hence, employees effectively pay w i, t / π i per unit of labor, which is taken into account by employers when hiring and firing employees. Firstly, the offered wageis compared to the effective requested wage. Secondly, employers will fire employees by order of their relative wage (i.e. highest to lowest w i, t / π i), instead of based on the nominal wage. This has the important implication that highly productive employees can request and maintain a higher wage than employees with low productivity. As such, the addition of labor productivity heterogeneity allows for a wage distribution that is endogenously unequal. This will be further discussed in "The Money Supply".

### Today's labor market: recruiting radiologists in a time of shortages [^1159abc7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent years have brought enormous changes to the specialty of diagnostic imaging and in particular to the radiology labor market. The impact of subspecialties, the increased use of advanced imaging, and lifestyle issues driving career-related and job-related decision making by young radiologists have combined to bring about a new world of recruitment. Success in attracting, hiring, and retaining desired candidates requires acceptance of today's radiology labor market conditions. Knowledge of exactly what conditions today's entry-level candidates are seeking is key. In addition, innovation in the recruitment and development of a desirable workplace can be extremely helpful. Although these challenges may be difficult for some radiology employers to accept, it may help to know that radiology is not alone. For a wide variety of reasons, some similar, some unique to particular specialties, most medical employers today must work hard and make compromises to hire the physicians they seek.

### Work-related injury burden, workers' compensation claim filing, and barriers: results from a statewide survey of janitors [^80c0f785]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of commercial cleaning work is performed by workers employed by specialized janitorial services firms that contract either directly with clients, or with a building management firm that provides a range of building management services to clients. The firm that controls the worksite and determines the scope of the work — the client — is distinct from the firm that employs and supervises the janitors. This organizational structure, termed "fissured" or "outsourced," became widespread in the late 20th century as part of a broad set of organizational changes that saw large, multifunctional firms shed many "non‐core" activities that had been performed in‐house by the firm's own employees. The aim of this shift was to allow the firm to reduce labor costs for ongoing, noncore activities. The source of labor cost reduction is that janitorial workers who are directly employed in a large multifunctional firm had both higher wages and benefits than did their counterparts working for small, specialized contract cleaning firms. By shedding these activities, lead firms could exclude some workers from participation in such benefits programs and convert a compensation and supervision issue into a transaction to be settled by contracting with a vendor in a competitive market. Empirical estimates of the wage reduction realized by firms that outsource such noncore activities range from 4%–7%to 15%–17%and these studies found that outsourced janitorial workers were much less likely to receive employer‐sponsored health insurance coverage.

### Closing the gender gap in competitiveness through priming [^63987daf]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Modern societies are still characterized by large differences between men and women, covering many different dimensions like status in society, access to resources, or success on labor markets. The persistent gender differences on labor markets perpetuate inequalities between men and women, for which reason academic research has been investigating the causes and consequences of gender differences for many years. Recently, a significant part of the large differences in labor market outcomes of men and women has been attributed to gender differences in performance under competitive pressure and in the willingness to compete –. Typically, women are observed to shy away from competition more often than men, which may explain poorer career prospects of women with respect to wages and promotions. As a consequence, policy interventions in the form of affirmative action programs have received much support both in the academic debate and among the general public. Various interventions have been found to promote gender-balanced outcomes in labor markets, including quotas –, preferential treatment of women, prizes benefiting one's offspring, or incentives based on co-operation. Nevertheless, such policies typically require (costly) institutional changes, are subject to skepticism and opposition, or hard to implement on practical grounds. There is even growing evidence that affirmative action programs can backfire against women.

For these reasons, we consider it as important to examine complementary, less intrusive and inexpensive, ways to mitigate or even offset the gender differences in competitiveness. Companies and their human resource departments may benefit from such alternatives because they have an interest in selecting the best candidates for a job, irrespective of gender, which requires the best candidates to accept the challenges of competition and feel comfortable in such situations. The latter conditions are more easily met when subjects feel in charge and are convinced that they can — metaphorically speaking — master their fate. This line of reasoning suggests that feelings of being in control may help reduce the gender gap in competitiveness. Therefore, we present a novel design where we combine the psychological tool of priming with power with an economic experiment on competitiveness. Our hypothesis is that when a feeling of power is activated, this might create in women a feeling of being in control to achieve one's goals and hence could close the gender gap in the willingness to compete.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^b0d3b5e8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The production of capital goods requires the input of labor. It is assumed the production of capital goods takes the whole time period. Machines are thus ordered at the start of the period and delivered at the end of the period. A complication that follows from the inclusion of households is that producers no longer get a portion of the labor force assigned (as in ref.). Instead, they have to attract employees through the labor market process (described in "Labor Market"). This means that producers that fire employees, and want to hire them back a period later are likely to find they labor demand can no longer be met. In order to avoid this, consumer good producers smooth their demand for labor. This is done through the global smoothing parameter λ ∈ [0, 1]. Using this and based on the amount of ordered machines O i, t, the capital good producer sets its demand for laboras follows:where L i, t −1 is the labor stock of the producer at time t −1 andis the average wage paid to employees. Due to the labor supply smoothing, the desired labor stock can thus be larger than strictly needed for the desired production level, as to avoid labor shortages in later periods.

Consumer good producers

Our model introduces an adaptive scheme for expected demand and long-term production planning, enhancing the basic approach of ref. Moreover, we modify the markup dynamics and allow producers to select capital goods based on a proportional inverse squared cost function rather than simply choosing the cheapest option. This change prevents a small number of capital good producers from dominating the entire market, creating a more competitive environment. Consumer good producers use their stock of capital and labor to produce consumer goods. The production is given as a Leontief production function, meaning production is limited by the absolute size of either the capital stock or the productivity-weighted labor stock. The maximum possible production amountfor consumer good producer i at time t is thus given as:whereis the average labor productivity of the machines owned by the firm, weighted by the frequency of the machines. Production is thus constrained by the labor supply, the average productivity level, and the absolute stock of capital.

### Global labor flow network reveals the hierarchical organization and dynamics of geo-industrial clusters [^46c84864]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Groups of firms often achieve a competitive advantage through the formation of geo-industrial clusters. Although many exemplary clusters are the subjects of case studies, systematic approaches to identify and analyze the hierarchical structure of geo-industrial clusters at the global scale are scarce. In this work, we use LinkedIn's employment history data from more than 500 million users over 25 years to construct a labor flow network of over 4 million firms across the world, from which we reveal hierarchical structure by applying network community detection. We show that the resulting geo-industrial clusters exhibit a stronger association between the influx of educated workers and financial performance, compared to traditional aggregation units. Furthermore, our analysis of the skills of educated workers reveals richer insights into the relationship between the labor flow of educated workers and productivity growth. We argue that geo-industrial clusters defined by labor flow provide useful insights into the growth of the economy.

### Job flows into and out of health care before and after the COVID-19 pandemic [^e848757d]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study found a significant increase in health care worker turnover after the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we found that even though overall employment levels broadly stabilized in the health care sector by the end of 2020, health care worker exit rates remained elevated above 2018 baseline levels through the end of 2021. These increased exit rates were matched in part by an increase in hiring by health care firms during the pandemic, which helps explain why employment levels were not as affected as turnover rates. The increase in health care workforce turnover may pose substantial costs for both organizations and patients, as it implies potentially disrupted continuity of care and fewer staff with industry- and firm-specific experience. Increasing evidence has suggested that staff dissatisfaction and staff turnover in health care settings can have unfavorable implications for patient care even without staffing shortages.,

There has been concern that the implications of the pandemic for the health care workforce may be long-lasting, as workers who stayed employed through the stress of the pandemic leave for new opportunities now. In addition, the robust labor market may have intensified these exits. We found that the composition of these additional exits shifted over time from being primarily associated with additional health care workers exiting into nonemployment in early 2020 to more health care workers exiting to other, non–health care sectors in 2021. This increase in people exiting to other sectors may be a cause for concern for health care organizations and policymakers, as it may suggest a declining overall competitiveness of health care jobs in the broader labor market. To address this, policymakers and health care organizations may consider policies to improve working conditions through establishing staffing ratios, supporting career development, and offering support for dependent care.

### Unequal exchange of labour in the world economy [^b5d3ef02]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Unequal exchange is understood to be driven in part by large North–South wage gaps. We find that Southern wages are 87–95% lower than Northern wages for work of equal skill. Our analysis confirms arguments by others (e.g. Ruy Mauro Marini, Samir Amin, Arrighi Emmanuel, etc.) that these wage gaps cannot be explained by sectoral differences, as they prevail across all sectors of the economy: the wages of Southern workers are 83–98% lower for work of equal skill within the same sector. In absolute terms, these wage gaps have increased substantially over time, across all skill levels and all sectors, indicating a steady increase in absolute North–South income inequality, despite some improvement in the South's relative position during the 2005–2015 period. This has occurred even though there has been a steady increase in industrial manufacturing as a share of total production in (and exports from) the global South during the period studied. We conclude that while Southern workers contribute the majority (90–91%) of labour that powers the world economy, they receive only 21% of global GDP. The yields of production are disproportionately captured in the global North.

It is interesting to note that our results describing the North's reliance on high-skilled labour from the South confirm statements made by the CEOs of major firms, who have claimed that the necessary quantity of high-skilled engineering labour to support their production is not available in the core states and therefore this production must be performed abroad. Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs noted that his company required 30,000 engineers; as he put it, "You can't find that many in America to hire". Current CEO Tim Cook has noted that Apple's production relies on large quantities of high-skilled labour in China for advanced engineering, tooling and innovation. "In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields". High-skilled labour in the global South is paid a fraction of that in the North, despite the fact that Northern firms cannot function without it.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^8bfdbb83]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Super-affluent consumers and growth imperatives

Growth imperatives are active at multiple levels, making the pursuit of economic growth (net investment, i.e. investment above depreciation) a necessity for different actors and leading to social and economic instability in the absence of it. Following a Marxian perspective as put forward by Pirgmaier and Steinberger, growth imperatives can be attributed to capitalism as the currently dominant socio-economic system in affluent countries, although this is debated by other scholars. To structure this topic, we will discuss different affected actors separately, namely corporations, states and individuals, following Richters and Siemoneit. Most importantly, we address the role of the super-affluent consumers within a society, which overlap with powerful fractions of the capitalist class. From a Marxian perspective, this social class is structurally defined by its position in the capitalist production process, as financially tied with the function of capital. In capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, implying that they must compete in labour markets to sell their labour power to capitalists in order to earn a living.

Even though some small- and medium-sized businesses manage to refrain from pursuing growth, e.g. due to a low competition intensity in niche markets, or lack of financial debt imperatives, this cannot be said for most firms. In capitalism, firms need to compete in the market, leading to a necessity to reinvest profits into more efficient production processes to minimise costs (e.g. through replacing human labour power with machines and positive returns to scale), innovation of new products and/or advertising to convince consumers to buy more. As a result, the average energy intensity of labour is now twice as high as in 1950. As long as a firm has a competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to sell as much as possible. Financial markets are crucial to enable this constant expansion by providing (interest-bearing) capital and channelling it where it is most profitable. If a firm fails to stay competitive, it either goes bankrupt or is taken over by a more successful business. Under normal economic conditions, this capitalist competition is expected to lead to aggregate growth dynamics.

### Meeting the challenges of an aging workforce [^6873afc3]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Demographic, labor market and economic forces are combining to produce increases in the number and percentage of U.S. workers 55 and older. In some ways these workers will be our most skilled and productive employees but in others the most vulnerable.

Methods

The literature on aging and work was reviewed, including demographic trends, physical and cognitive changes, safety and performance, work ability, and retirement patterns.

Results and Conclusions

Older workers have more serious, but less frequent, workplace injuries and illnesses than younger ones. There is evidence that many of these problems can be prevented and their consequences reduced by anticipating the physical and cognitive changes of age. Many employers are aware that such efforts are necessary, but most have not yet addressed them. There is a need for implementation and evaluative research of programs and policies with four dimensions: the work environment, work arrangements and work-life balance, health promotion and disease prevention, and social support. Employers who establish age-friendly workplaces that promote and support the work ability of employees as they age may gain in safety, productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable business practices.

### Closing the gender gap in competitiveness through priming [^1eb0b830]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The competition experiment

We randomly assigned participants into groups of two men and two women (four persons in total per group). Other than this gender composition, participants received no further information regarding their potential competitors. All groups went through three stages that were programmed with z-Tree. The experimental task in each stage was to add up as many two-digit numbers as possible within two minutes. In Stage 1, called "piece rate", each participant received €1 for each correct calculation. In Stage 2, "tournament", group members were in a competition against each other. Only the member who solved the highest number of calculations correctly was paid €4 per correct calculation, all others received no payment. In Stage 3, "choice", participants could choose before solving the calculations whether they wanted to do so under the piece rate (as in Stage 1) or the tournament payment scheme (as in Stage 2). If a participant chose the tournament scheme, his or her performance in this stage was then compared to the other group members' performance in Stage 2 (which transforms the choice in Stage 3 into an individual decision making task, thus avoiding that expectations about other members' entry decisions might affect one's choice). If a participant's performance in Stage 3 was higher than the ones of all other group members in Stage 2, the participant received €2 for every correctly solved calculation, otherwise zero. Ties were broken randomly.

These incentives differ with respect to most of the previous literature, since entering the competition in our experiment yields, on average, lower expected payoffs than choosing the piece rate in Stage 3. Actually, it is quite often the case that tournaments pay less than piece rates on average. Recent evidence suggests that cost-minimizing firms prefer to choose the lowest tournament prizes possible, since these would still be enough to attract good applicants, in particular, when they are overconfident and have a much higher subjective probability of winning the tournament than the objective probability justifies. Such conditions yield lower expected payoffs from the tournament than from a piece rate, for which reason we consider our incentives in Stage 3 to be a good representation of many real-world situations. Moreover, if the gender gap persists under these conditions, this would show that previous findings are robust to a change in incentives and also that our results are comparable to the findings in the existing literature.

### The impact of alternative arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app on the well-being of working age adults: results from the California work and health survey [^eba9abbe]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

4 | DISCUSSION

Although hardly as comprehensive as in many other developed nations, during the 20th Century the US developed a set of laws and regulations to protect workers from discrimination in hiring, promotion, and retention on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and disability status; to help them attain a minimum of economic security while employed through rights to organize, the establishment of a wage floor, and, more recently, mandating employment-based health insurance coverage; minimizing the economic impacts of work loss through unemployment insurance; minimizing the health risks of work through workers' compensation and occupational health and safety; and maintaining a minimum standard of living in retirement through Social Security and Medicare.

This system of protections was developed over roughly a century, starting with workers' compensation in the first two decades of the last century, and culminating in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. With certain exceptions, such as the availability of Social Security to self-employed workers, the tie that binds these protections is that they assume that the worker is formally hired by the firm for which work is done. The ride-share driver may not attain a minimum wage when the costs of car ownership are factored in. The person shopping for and then delivering groceries may be at risk for musculoskeletal injuries, just as might the person stocking the shelves in a supermarket who was formally hired to do the work, but without the possibility of filing a workers' compensation claim and without an Occupational and Health Safety Administration (OSHA) inspection to investigate the cause of the injury. While the system of protections for workers formally hired is hardly ironclad — think about the fate of undocumented workers in dangerous factories — workers who are not formally hired by the firm for whom the work is done have fewer protections. Although those in contingent jobs may be formally hired, they too may experience work exposures that adversely affect them after the job is completed. In California, the site of our study and the focus of the California Labor Laboratory, our Center funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), there has been considerable legislative and regulatory ferment to try to mitigate the effects of being an independent contractor, having other forms of alternative work, or work secured through an app, principally through Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) which established legal criteria for determining whether, in fact, someone should be considered an employee rather than outside contractor. The effects of AB5 have been somewhat offset by the passage of Proposition 22 in which ride share and delivery companies sought to delimit the reach of AB5 while providing some protections in its stead. As of this writing, the constitutionality of Proposition 22 is before the California Supreme Court. At the Federal level, a new regulation also seeks to mitigate the effects of this kind of work through regulation of the definition of independent contracting.

### Global labor flow network reveals the hierarchical organization and dynamics of geo-industrial clusters [^1b53aab6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
The influx of educated labor force is linked to the growth of geo-industrial clusters. The horizontal axis represents the 5-year trend in college-degree labor flux from 2010 to 2014. Similarly, the vertical axis represents the 5-year trend in log-scaled market capitalization within the cluster over time. a The trends for individual firms. b The trends for geographical regions. c The trends for industries, and d the trends for geo-industrial clusters, which displays the strongest relationship

Overall, we see a positive relationship between the acceleration of college-degree employment growth and market capitalization growth although the strength of the relationship depends on the aggregation used (see Fig. 4). At the level of individual firms, the data is too noisy to establish any clear patterns (Fig. 4a). Geographical aggregation similarly shows little association between labor growth and market capitalization growth, suggesting that location-based grouping is also not a good approach, probably because each location hosts a multitude of disparate industries. Although the industry-level aggregation in Fig. 4c shows a stronger relationship, the strongest correlation can be found in the geo-industrial cluster-based aggregation (see Fig. 4d). These results hold for more complex bayesian models and are robust to the selection of time window, or the inclusion or exclusion of first-job influx and last-job outflux (see Supplementary Figures 3–7, with Supplementary Note 3). The stronger association between the influx of educated labor and economic growth in the geo-industrial cluster level, in comparison with traditional industry- or region-based aggregation, suggests that firms that share labor also share economic growth or decline. This is perhaps driven by shared competitive advantages due to labor market integration and knowledge spillover effects.

In turn, we distinguish two types of regions: those that have a single manager, and those that are shared such that all managers are free to harvest. Ultimately, the harvest methods used by all managers determine the total areas that become degraded at time t in the managed and in the shared regions at the global scale, and, respectively. Accordingly, the total non-degraded areas in all managed regions, x 1, and in all shared regions, x 2, decrease due to non-sustainable harvest as follows:Moreover, the harvest functions are constrained by the non-degraded areas:for all t, where.

In turn, we assume that harvest comes with a direct cost as more labor and resources are directed toward harvesting. We incorporate this direct cost as a reduction in c (t), which would otherwise grow exponentially at an exogenous rate g c due to technological developments. Specifically, we assume that c (t) is given bywhere C 1 and C 2 are the direct costs of harvesting (in units of c), and λ is the ratio between the direct costs of non-sustainable and sustainable harvest.

Model of the competitive market

It remains to specify how the harvest strategies of the managers at the local scale are determined, and how these strategies determine the harvest functions at the global scale,… We are interested in comparing two types of solutions: The optimal solution that maximizes the social welfare, and the market solution that emerges in a competitive market. The optimal solution is found via the maximization of the social welfare (Eq. 4) subject to the constraints given in Eqs. 6–9. In turn, to define the market solution, we consider a competitive market in which each manager aims to maximize her/his own utility. Specifically, we consider a well-established framework in which the market is perfectly competitive, such that, if property rights are defined everywhere and there are no externalities, the market solution coincides with the optimal solution. In turn, the market solution depends on the form of the externalities for the various managers, namely, it depends on how non-sustainable harvest by a given manager affects the ecosystem in regions managed by other managers.

### Universal resilience patterns in labor markets [^a911bc88]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cities are the innovation centers of the US economy, but technological disruptions can exclude workers and inhibit a middle class. Therefore, urban policy must promote the jobs and skills that increase worker pay, create employment, and foster economic resilience. In this paper, we model labor market resilience with an ecologically-inspired job network constructed from the similarity of occupations' skill requirements. This framework reveals that the economic resilience of cities is universally and uniquely determined by the connectivity within a city's job network. US cities with greater job connectivity experienced lower unemployment during the Great Recession. Further, cities that increase their job connectivity see increasing wage bills, and workers of embedded occupations enjoy higher wages than their peers elsewhere. Finally, we show how job connectivity may clarify the augmenting and deleterious impact of automation in US cities. Policies that promote labor connectivity may grow labor markets and promote economic resilience.

C In cities where the occupation is more embedded, Financial Managers earn higher wages than their peers in other cities. Point color corresponds to Financial Manager's embeddedness in each city (i.e. corresponds to the city's color in B)). D For 75% of workers nationwide, workers of the same occupation earn higher wages in cities where the occupation has greater embeddedness. See Supplementary Note 8 for a controlled regression analysis and embeddedness maps for other occupations. E Using 2010 as a baseline, cities that increased job connectivity saw corresponding increases in wage bill ($). There is a data point for each city and each year from 2011 to 2017. See Supplementary Note 9 for regression analysis and a similar analysis of year-to-year dynamics.

Besides the Great Recession, can job connectivity tell us about other labor shocks, such as technology and automation? To explore, we combine our model with estimates of occupation-level exposure to computerizationand simulate urban employment (see Supplementary Note 7 for simulation details). An occupation i is automated if its probability of computerization is above some minimum threshold θ. All workers of an automated occupation are immediately unemployed and job seekers can no longer become employed in that occupation (i.e. w ij = 0 for each i ≠ j). With Chicago, IL as an example (see Fig. 4 A), decreasing θ corresponds to greater automation and decreasing job connectivity in cities (see Fig. 4 B). Not only are jobs lost because of automation, but job networks become sparser and less resilient.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^dad1603c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

However, two factors exist that further strengthen this growth dynamic. Firstly, if labour productivity continuously rises, then aggregate economic growth becomes necessary to keep employment constant, otherwise technological unemployment results. This creates one of the imperatives for capitalist states to foster aggregate growth, since with worsening economic conditions and high unemployment, tax revenues shrink, e.g. from labour and value-added taxes, while social security expenditures rise. Adding to this, states compete with other states geopolitically and in providing favourable conditions for capital, while capitalists have the resources to influence political decisions in their favour. If economic conditions are expected to deteriorate, e.g. due to unplanned recession or progressive political change, firms can threaten capital flight, financial markets react and investor as well as consumer confidence shrink. Secondly, consumers usually increase their consumption in tune with increasing production. This process can be at least in part explained by substantial advertising efforts by firms. However, further mechanisms are at play as explained further below.

Following this analysis, it is not surprising that the growth paradigm is hegemonic, i.e. the perception that economic growth solves all kinds of societal problems, that it equals progress, power and welfare and that it can be made practically endless through some form of supposedly green or sustainable growth. Taken together, the described dynamics create multiple dependencies of workers, firms and states on a well-functioning capital accumulation and thus wield more material, institutional and discursive power (e.g. for political lobbying) to capitalists who are usually the most affluent consumers. Even if different fractions of the capitalist class have manifold and competing interests which need to be constantly renegotiated, there is a common interest in maintaining the capitalist system and favourable conditions for capital accumulation, e.g. through aggregate growth and high consumption. How this political corruption by the super-affluent plays out in practice is well documented, e.g. for the meat industry in Denmark.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^5e2dff2e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To examine the effect of over-harvesting on the natural resource and on the discount rate, we compare scenarios in which over-harvesting occurs to scenarios in which it does not. We consider two approaches. First, we consider a competitive market approach in which we compare the optimal solution that maximizes social welfare with the solution that emerges in a model of a perfectly competitive market with externalities (Figs. 2 and 3). Specifically, the competitive market includes managed regions that have a single manager (e.g. landowner, government), and shared regions in which multiple managers are free to harvest (e.g. open-access) (see Methods). Second, we consider a more general approach in which we compare the dynamics that emerge when the harvest is entirely sustainable with the dynamics that emerge following various ad hoc choices of non-sustainable harvest functions (Theorem and Fig. 4).

Competitive Employment

The primary outcome was the rate of competitive employment during follow-up, with 12 months after enrollment as the primary follow-up period. In line with previous trials of IPS, this outcome was defined as the percentage of participants in each group who obtained ordinary paid employment in the competitive labor market during the follow-up period, with a threshold of a least 1 day of work. Dichotomous variables indicating any competitive employment vs no competitive employment were created. Long-term follow-up data on the primary outcome were also collected at 24 months.

Additional standardized indicators of success in employment were the percentage of participants working ≥ 20 hours in 1 week (which corresponds to at least half-time employment), total hours worked or wages, and the number of weeks employed during the 12-month follow-up. Data on wages and employment duration were incomplete and are not reported. Employment specialists also recorded the types of jobs attained among participants in the IPS group.

### The impact of wages on care home quality in england [^c99869ed]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Staff play a vital role in the delivery of LTC services. Although there is a large existing literature on the effects of staffing on quality (e.g.) and the impact of minimum wage on staffing (e.g.;), the evidence as to the impact that staff remuneration has on care quality has mainly been at the policy level. A recent exception is, who analyzed the effects of minimum wages in the U.S. nursing home industry, finding evidence of significant improvements in staff retention and resident outcomes for those homes with higher staff wages. Our analysis added to this research by assessing the effect of wages on the quality of LTC facilities (both residential and nursing) in England using a national staffing database for 2016–2018, which included staff wage data. LTC firms made decisions on staff pay, subject to the conditions they faced, which included an annually uprated national minimum wage. We found that facilities that paid a higher average wage to care staff had higher quality. We have controlled for a large number of observed factors that are likely to affect the wage–quality relationship, such as needs, sector, financial status, resident wealth, and staff skills. We have also controlled for the endogeneity of wage. Overall, our finding complements the evidence for the United States and extends the existing literature for English LTC facilities.

The production of welfare approach provided a theoretical model from which labor inputs, including staff attitudes, can influence resident outcomes, and efficiency wage theory offers an explanation for how an increased wage can improve productivity. From this, we hypothesized that an increased average wage would cause increased productivity from workers due to improved attitudes and less shirking, improving overall facility quality. Our findings support this hypothesis, but we have been unable to fully assess what is driving the quality improvement. We found that the wage effect was stronger in nursing homes (as compared to residential homes), where, given higher levels of needs, the potential to shirk would be stronger. This adds to the findings of, who showed that the positive association between wages and quality was unlikely due to poor-performing firms exiting the market, or changes in the characteristics of patients and staff. However, further research is required to assess why care staff wage affects quality.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^6367aafc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

In this section, we detail the methodology employed in our study, centered around an ABM approach. The core of our model consists of four main types of agents: households, capital-good producers, consumer-good producers, and one energy producer. Each with distinct roles and behaviors that are crucial to understanding the phenomena under study and relate to earlier work in the model design. In the following subsections, we provide an in-depth description of each agent type, including their attributes, decision-making processes, and interactions with other agents.

Update sequence in the model

The model operates through a series of steps repeated in each time period to simulate interactions between households, producers, the labor market, and the government. The process begins with capital good and energy producers innovating, setting prices, and sending brochures to consumer good producers. Next, consumer good producers plan production, determine labor and capital demands, and order capital goods. Households then search for jobs, while producers hire according to their labor needs. Producers pay wages, and the government distributes unemployment benefits. Consumer good producers manufacture goods based on available capital and labor, and the energy producer adjusts output to meet demand. Households update consumption based on their wealth, and goods are traded in the consumer market. Capital goods are delivered, profits calculated, and taxes paid. The government assesses its budget, borrowing or redistributing surplus funds. Carbon emissions are aggregated, bankrupt firms exit the market, new firms are introduced, and the IF adjusts its balance. Lastly, the IF redistributes dividends or losses to households based on their financial status.

Construction of skill distribution from income data.

(left) Empirical income distribution and fitted log-normal distribution. (right) Skill distribution is based on the fitted income distribution, normalized to represent the total skill pool in the economy.

Their economic behavior, influenced by diverse income sources such as labor, investments, and social benefits, shapes their consumption, savings decisions, and overall liquid wealth (W i, t). Actively engaging in both labor and goods markets, households make strategic consumption choices based on price and availability and adjust market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. This adaptive behavior not only reflects their individual economic circumstances but also contributes to the broader market dynamics, affecting the supply-demand equilibrium in the consumer goods and labor markets. At each time step t, households make decisions: (1) the amount of goods to consume and their suppliers, (2) their employer. The consumption amount depends on their wealth level W i, t, interpreting W i, t as liquid wealth excluding assets like real estate (as in). The wealth level adjusts through various income sources, with labor incomedefined as:where w i, t is the wage for L i labor units provided, and U B t are unemployment benefits. Total wealth for consumption at t is, where L A i, t is the liquid asset level. Households choose goods based on price and availability, adjusting market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. In case of unmet demand, they buy from other producers until no supply remains, avoiding high involuntary savings due to market mismatches. After transactions, they know their true consumption leveland liquid assets L A i, t +1 for the next period. Households may break trade connections with unsatisfactory suppliers (probability ψ Q) or seek lower prices (probability ψ P), applying pressure on producers to meet demand and reduce prices. Again, they are only bounded rational. In our case, this means, instead of analytically solving their explicit inter-temporal choice problem, they approximate it by comparing a finite set of actions (i.e. they lack the ability to compute perfect optima). These households have consumption and investment preferences, based on their wealth levels and heterogeneous time preferences. Each household i inter-temporal optimization problem is defined as:where α i is the absolute propensity to consume, as a portion of wealth level W i, t.is the household's discount factor with j − t as index for current and future time steps, and U (⋅) is the utility function, given as. This optimization problem is constrained by:Here, Y i, t is the household's income level at time t, which can come from labor, capital, or government subsidies. C i, t is the consumption level and r t the real interest rate. In order to solve the optimization problem in equation (2), households form expectations of their future income- and wealth level and the interest rate. These expectations are formed using simple adaptive updating rules:whereis the expected value and ω is a weighting factor. Based on the optimization problem, heterogeneous time preferences, and adjusting changing expectations, households have heterogeneous saving rates on both the cross-sectional and inter-temporal levels. Furthermore, these savings are precautionary, meaning that savings are motivated by the desire to keep a stable consumption level in case of a negative income shock. As a result, aggregate behavior qualitatively matches empirical data for the marginal propensity to consume, as shown in Fig. S7.

### Universal resilience patterns in labor markets [^c487fd68]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Table 1
Linear regression models predicting the peak unemployment rate in US cities during the Great Recession. Using 2007 employment data from the year before the recession, labor diversity measured through urban employment distributions (H c), occupation diversity (N c), and job connectivity (w eff) predict labor responses to Great Recession. Variables were centered and standardized prior to analysis.

p value < 0. 1 *, p value < 0.01 **, p value < 0.001 **

Since job connectivity may promote economic resilience to labor disruptions, how can policy makers and individuals leverage connectivity and job network projections? One way is to compare the embeddedness of a single occupation in the job network projection of each city (e.g. see Fig. 3 A, B). For 75% of US employment and 96% of US occupations, workers of a given occupation that is more embedded in their city's labor market earn higher annual wages than workers of the same occupation in other cities (see Fig. 3 C, D). We observe evidence for this embeddedness wage premium even after additionally controlling for a occupation's employment share, educational requirements, city fixed effects, and occupation fixed effects (see Supplementary Note 8 for more details). This suggests workers may benefit from employment opportunities in cities where their employment would boost the city's job connectivity. In general, cities that increased their job connectivity from 2010 through 2017 saw an increase in their wage bill (i.e. total wages. See Fig. 3 E). Thus, policy makers may be able to grow their local labor market through targeted investment in the companies and industries that employ workers of embedded occupations which increases the overall job connectivity of the city.

### Job quality and job separation of direct care workers in england [^0a512307]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

The risk of omitted variable bias is also reduced by controlling for a large number of worker, job, employer, and local market characteristics. At the employer level, we included controls for sector (i.e. public, for-profit, and not-for-profit), user type (i.e. younger adults, older people, and mixed), establishment size, the direct care worker per service user ratio (as a proxy for workload), the vacancy rate in the previous year (as a proxy for difficulties with hiring sufficient direct care workers), as well as the independent care regulator rating of the management (i.e. the CQC rating on the Key Line of Enquiry "Well-led"). Moreover, we included the turnover rate in the previous year to capture any potential "chain" effects with respect to separations. Job-related characteristics at the worker level included job role, tenure (i.e. number of years with the current employer), training incidence, the log of hourly wage, full-time employment, and employment on contract without guaranteed working hours (i.e. zero-hours contract). At the local level, we controlled for the unemployment rate, the average wage for women, a measure of competition in the local LTC market, wealth (i.e. average house prices), as well as the LTC tariffs paid by local councils with LTC responsibilities, which could impact the revenue of LTC establishments and implicitly the pay and employment conditions offered to direct care workers.

### The paradox of aging population and firm digital transformation in China [^a807893a]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, some scholars argue that aging can have a positive impact due to a feedback mechanism. They believe that population aging forces companies to undergo digital transformation, for example, by encouraging them to enhance employee training and hire highly educated individuals. Other scholars point out that the innovation effect of population aging is greater than its cost effect, asserting that digital transformation is better driven by skilled and experienced employees, including older employees. Indeed, some studies show that population aging pushes companies to invest in R&D for innovation. Thus, we argue that the impact of population aging on firms' digital transformation may be more complex and nonlinear than previously thought.

Current research primarily explores the negative or positive linear effects of population aging on digital transformation, with few studies synthesizing and considering both scenarios. Our study attempts to fill this gap by developing a nonlinear model. Specifically, we propose and validate a nonlinear relationship model to explain the relationship between population aging and digital transformation from the perspectives of labor cost theory, the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis, and human capital externalities. We analyze the boundary mechanisms by which population aging affects digital transformation, considering institutional environment and corporate strategy.

Our empirical tests involve Chinese A-share listed companies from 2001 to 2022, revealing a U-shaped relationship between population aging and digital transformation. From the perspective of the institutional environment, we find that in regions with a higher degree of marketization, the slopes on both sides of the U-shaped relationship curve are steeper, and the vertex shifts to the left. Conversely, in regions with higher minimum wage levels, the slopes on both sides of the U-shaped relationship curve are flatter, and the vertex shifts to the right.

From the perspective of corporate strategy, our study also finds that higher levels of marketing capability make the slopes on both sides of the U-shaped relationship curve steeper, with the vertex shifting to the left. Conversely, higher levels of customer concentration make the slopes on both sides of the U-shaped relationship curve flatter, with the vertex shifting to the right.

### COVID-19 driven advances in automation and artificial intelligence risk exacerbating economic inequality [^6c30cf2d]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Our institutions and norms interact in important ways with market incentives for technological progress. Most visibly, our system of intellectual property rights, by providing temporary monopoly power to inventors, is meant to facilitate innovation. But often it has the opposite effect — inhibiting access to existing knowledge and making the production of new ideas more difficult. Moreover, by inhibiting competition, both innovation and access to the benefits of the advances that occur are reduced. These are arguments for keeping the scope and length of intellectual property rights limited.

Finally, markets are inherently bad at delivering the human element that is so important in medical care. Markets do not adequately reward the empathy and compassion that medical workers provide to their patients and, in fact, provide incentives to scrimp on them. If our technological choices are driven solely by the market, they will reflect the same bias and patient care is likely to be affected. It is essential that decision makers act to ensure that our technological choices reflect our human values.

Key messages

The covid-19 pandemic has increased the risk and raised the cost of direct physical contact between humans, as is particularly visible in healthcare
This has accelerated advances in AI and other forms of automation to decrease physical contact and mitigate the risk of disease transmission
These technological advances benefit technologists but could reduce labour demand more broadly and slow wage growth, increasing inequality between workers and the owners of technology
These forces can be counteracted by intentionally steering technological progress in AI to complement labour, increasing its productivity

### Characteristics of low-wage workers and their labor market… [^d7801ae9]. aspe.hhs.gov (2004). Low credibility.

What circumstances are associated with wage growth in the low-wage labor market. Are those employed in certain occupations or industries more likely than others to experience wage growth. Are initial wage and earnings levels associated with wage growth. Do those who continue in the same job experience greater or lower wage growth than those who switch jobs. Do low-wage workers experience more or less wage growth than higher-wage workers. Defining Low-Wage Workers Researchers have used several definitions of the low-wage labor market. One approach has been to define low-wage workers as those whose. increased slightly over time, from 24 percent in 1973, to 27 percent in 1987, to 29 percent in 1997. Interestingly, the five percentage point increase between 1973 and 1997 was due entirely to an upward trend for males but not for females. all workers in the labor force.

Similarly, like the rest of the workforce, the low-wage sector became older and included more minorities. However, studies show that the low-wage workforce became increasingly male between 1973 and 1997, even though the female share of the entire workforce increased. 2001). For example, the real wages of males with wages at the 20th percentile of the wage distribution declined by about 20 percent between 1973 and 1994. At the same time, real wages rose for workers in the upper tails of the wage distribution; thus, earnings inequality increased during the period. Since 1994, however, the real wages of low-skilled male and female workers increased as a result of the strong economy. For example, the real wage of the 10th-percentile worker rose about nine percent between 1995 and 1999. some low-wage workers experience wage growth, while others do not.

Studies also find that movement out of the low-wage labor market into the higher-wage one increases with time spent in the labor market. Two patterns, however, are noteworthy. First, although there is some increase out of the low-wage labor market with time, the movements are not large. Second, a considerable number of low-wage workers drop out of the labor force over time, so that the group that remains is a somewhat select sample.

### The impact of alternative arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app on the well-being of working age adults: results from the California work and health survey [^8d13adbc]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

The impact of forms of work, spanning alternative work arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app have become an important focus of public concern. Part of the concern has been about the magnitude of these forms, specifically whether they are growing at the expense of more traditional employment in which the worker is formally hired by the firm for which the work is done on a more permanent basis. Part, too, is due to the growing visibility of task- and project-based work secured through apps that connect workers to customers.

While trends in the magnitude of alternative work arrangements are subject to debate, – another issue is the impact of these arrangements on the well-being of the workers and their families in a range of domains, including economic sufficiency and worker health and safety.– The lack of a permanent relationship between workers and firms also severs one avenue of career mobility, the internal labor market of the firm itself. The effects of alternative work arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app may also burden government at all levels tasked with ensuring access to safe work - difficult when there is no on-going relationship between worker and firm- often with no identified workplace; providing a safety net of health insurance through such mechanisms as Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act; and providing income support through such mechanisms as the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Indeed, more than almost any other nation, our system of income and health security is tied to the provision of benefits through employment. This system may not serve workers who are not formally or permanently hired to do work.

The use of alternative work arrangements, contingent jobs, and work secured through an app is increasingly understood in the context of larger corporate strategies to reduce exposure of the firm to the cost of labor, labeled the fissuring of work, and to shift the risks to workers and their families. The use of these overarching strategies may grow even if the use of some of their specific aspects, like the use of alternative work arrangements, does not.

The present study is designed to provide estimates of the impact of several forms of work, including alternative ways of hiring, contingent jobs, and app-based work, on economic well-being of individuals and households, their health status, and on-the-job exposures.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^1916d58b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To define the externalities, we distinguish between managed regions and shared regions (Fig. 1). Each managed region is managed by a single manager who determines the harvest method, which may vary anywhere between using only sustainable methods and using only non-sustainable methods. In turn, the harvest method in a given region determines the portion of the region that is harvested and the rate at which the region becomes degraded (Fig. 1). We assume that the management in a given managed region has no externalities as it affects only the degradation level in that region. In turn, the shared regions are managed by a very large number of managers, each of whom is free to harvest without restrictions there. Specifically, we assume that each manager ignores the effect of her/his actions on the future provision of the resource in the shared regions and considers only her/his instantaneous benefit and cost from the harvest. Consequently, the managers have the incentive to increase non-sustainable harvest in the shared regions until the price of the natural resource equals the direct cost of the harvest. These considerations enable us to find the market solution that is given by the unique Nash equilibrium (see the section Numerical methods). In particular, the perfectly competitive market assumption implies that the management in the managed regions is socially optimal under the constraint given by the management in the shared regions. Note that, without shared regions (x 2 = 0), there are no externalities and the market solution coincides with the optimal solution.

### The paradox of aging population and firm digital transformation in China [^357006e9]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although a number researchers have acknowledged that the aging population inhibits firm digital transformation, others find it promoting digital transformation in some firms. As the relevant literature to clarify such paradox is still scare, this paper wants to fill the gap regarding the labor cost theory, the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis, and the human capital externality theory. Based on the empirical tests of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2001 to 2022, this study detected a U-shaped relationship between the aging population and digital transformation. In terms of the institutional environment, higher marketization strengthens the U-shaped relationship by making the slopes on either side of it steeper. However, higher minimum wage levels weaken the U-shaped relationship. In terms of firm strategy, firms with stronger marketing capabilities strengthened the U-shaped relationship. However, firms with higher customer concentration weakened the U-shaped relationship. Overall, we enriched scholarly understanding of the impact of the aging population on digital transformation and demonstrated the dual potential impact of aging populations. Instead of assuming they are detrimental to the economy and society, positive contributions in the form of innovation and progress for companies can be detected.

### Employer-sponsored health insurance for workers in the hourly service sector [^fe9f6216]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Current policy debate often assumes that large employers offer health insurance to their workers. In defending Medicaid cuts in HR 1, policymakers have argued that Medicaid coverage losses would be offset by gains in employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). This may seem plausible: the Affordable Care Act (ACA) employer shared responsibility provision requires that employers offer affordable minimum-value coverage or potentially face penalties. But exceptions to this provision limit its reach, especially in the service sector, where many workers with low-wage jobs are concentrated.

First, while service-sector firms might be assumed to have shared responsibility, such firms and many others employ workers through independent franchises that do not meet the ACA 50-worker cutoff that exempts employers from responsibility. Second, employees working fewer than 30 hours a week are also exempt. In the service sector, part-time status is widespread and often involuntary. Third, employers may impose a 90-day waiting period and a 12-month lookback period to assess compliance with the hours threshold. In a labor market characterized by high turnover, workers may not stay long enough to qualify. We use novel employer-employee linked survey data to show how these mechanisms may be associated with exclusion from coverage.

### Overcoming five key challenges to make the energy transition a just labor transition [^20d5662b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Labor market solutions from high-income countries will not always work well in low- and middle-income countries

Labor market policies used conventionally in high-income economies, as classified by the World Bank, may not be effective when applied in low- and middle-income economies, specific socio-economic, regulatory, and sectoral contexts. For example, while strong labor protections are essential, poorly designed regulations may inadvertently increase informality in some developing countries without achieving the desired worker protection. Institutional and technological capacity to implement complex labor market policies will vary across countries.

Low- and middle-income countries must design context-specific strategies, drawing from global lessons but addressing their unique challenges and capacities. Efforts like the World Bank's work on green job metrics tailored to low- and middle-income economies are a step forward. The Global North and South can learn from each other, particularly regarding high labor standards, promoting social dialogue, ensuring workers have a seat at decision-making tables, and ending unfair labor practices, forced labor, and denying the right to organize. Existing platforms like the International Labor Organization should be expanded to focus on Just Labor Transition.

### Trial-based economic evaluations in occupational health: principles, methods, and recommendations [^914c0910]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of Quantities of Resources Consumed

Resource use data are ideally collected prospectively through a data collection process that is fully integrated into the effectiveness trial. Also, when collecting self-reported resource use data, researchers have to balance recall bias against completeness of information. Shorter recall periods reduce the risk of participants forgetting important information. Nevertheless, collecting data with relatively short recall periods (eg, a couple of weeks) over a longer period of time may be overly burdensome to participants and may thus increase the risk of missing data and dropouts. Therefore, it may be better to maximize completeness at the cost of some recall bias, for example, by using 2- to 3-month recall periods in a trial with a long-term follow-up (≥ 12 months). Also, care should be taken to collect resource use data continuously during follow-up and to avoid the need for extrapolation of resource use estimates between measurement periods.

Assignment of Unit Prices

Unit prices used for valuing resource use ought to reflect opportunity costs, that is, "the value of a resource in its most highly valued alternative use." (p56) In a world of perfect markets, such costs are revealed by the market price of a good or service. Nevertheless, if a competitive market does not exist for a good or service, market prices often are an inaccurate measure of its value. For example, if a premium is paid for a good or service due to restricted market entry, market prices may overestimate the opportunity costs at the societal level. When the societal perspective is applied, an adjustment should, therefore, be made to the market price, for example, by using the price of a comparable good or service. For the employer's perspective, the actual purchase costs incurred by the employer may be more appropriate, as they better represent the sum of money that is not available to the employer for its best alternative use. Thus, appropriate unit prices may vary between perspectives, and researchers should ensure that they reflect the true resource implications to the decision maker at hand.

A brief description of the methods used for measuring and valuing the most frequently used resource use categories in economic evaluations of OHS interventions is provided later. The most frequently used resource use categories are intervention, productivity, health care, and workers' compensation costs.

### Personal care aides as household employees and independent contractors: estimating the size and job characteristics of the workforce [^d2e1ca4c]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

PCAs working as independent contractors, on the other hand, seem to have a lower chance of working full-time year-round than those employed by agencies. Their median annual earnings tend to be lower than those of agency employees. However, their mean annual earnings surpassed those of agency employees, indicating that some independent contractors were earning significantly more than agency employees. This seemed particularly true for full-time year-round working independent contractors in most states because their mean annual earnings were consistently higher than those of all agency employees working full-time year-round. Although these findings cannot serve as evidence of some of PCAs' motivations to work as household employees and independent contractors, they are suggestive of the potential that a higher earnings possibility may lure them into those employment arrangements. Given the fact that most PCAs lack full-time year-round employment and nonwage compensations, the potential to make higher earnings may significantly influence their decision to work as household employees or independent contractors. Yet, as discussed above, these workers may experience a higher risk of being unreported or misclassified workers as well as experiencing labor market injustice.

Besides the implications for workers' rights to economic security and labor market protection, employment arrangements also have significant implications for the quality of care that the PCAs provide. Because many states do not require training of PCAs even for those paid by Medicaid-funded programs, PCAs employed directly by consumers or through private-pay arrangements (i.e. independent contractors or household employees) are even less likely to be trained, certified, supervised by registered nurses regularly, and required to renew their certification. The lack of training requirements undermines the quality of the workforce, and the quality issue may be more acute for the workforce in less formal employment arrangements. The presence of a substantial size of household employees and independent contractors also has implications for the worker shortages in the more formal labor market as home care agencies see direct hires by consumers as the most serious competition. States with generous public home care programs may have a lower share of PCAs working as household employees or independent contractors. The presence of these employment arrangements for PCAs speaks to the poor job characteristics of the more formal labor market in the home care industry as well as the lack of access to publicly funded quality home care services for middle-income consumers in the United States.

### Monitoring hiring discrimination through online recruitment platforms [^6595d353]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Women (compared to men) and individuals from minority ethnic groups (compared to the majority group) face unfavourable labour market outcomes in many economies 1,2, but the extent to which discrimination is responsible for these effects, and the channels through which they occur, remain unclear 3,4. Although correspondence tests 5 -in which researchers send fictitious CVs that are identical except for the randomized minority trait to be tested (for example, names that are deemed to sound 'Black' versus those deemed to sound 'white')-are an increasingly popular method to quantify discrimination in hiring practices 6,7, they can usually consider only a few applicant characteristics in select occupations at a particular point in time. To overcome these limitations, here we develop an approach to investigate hiring discrimination that combines tracking of the search behaviour of recruiters on employment websites and supervised machine learning to control for all relevant jobseeker characteristics that are visible to recruiters. We apply this methodology to the online recruitment platform of the Swiss public employment service and find that rates of contact by recruiters are 4–19% lower for individuals from immigrant and minority ethnic groups, depending on their country of origin, than for citizens from the majority group. Women experience a penalty of 7% in professions that are dominated by men, and the opposite pattern emerges for men in professions that are dominated by women. We find no evidence that recruiters spend less time evaluating the profiles of individuals from minority ethnic groups. Our methodology provides a widely applicable, non-intrusive and cost-efficient tool that researchers and policy-makers can use to continuously monitor hiring discrimination, to identify some of the drivers of discrimination and to inform approaches to counter it.

### Job quality and job separation of direct care workers in england [^251bdf92]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Factors Affecting Turnover

There is a growing literature on the determinants of LTC workforce job separation and turnover — seefor a review — revealing the importance of various factors associated with worker, job, employer, and local market characteristics.

At a local level, lower unemployment and higher competition have been found to be positively associated with a higher turnover of direct care workers, while wages of alternative job opportunities in the same locality can further influence this relationship. Failure to adequately control for local labor market characteristics (including wages) can potentially bias the estimated effects.

At the organizational level, care establishment size, for-profit ownership, home care provision, lower staffing levels, and a higher share of direct care workers on contracts without guaranteed hours have been found to be associated with higher turnover rates. The management style also mattered. For example, practices that gave direct care workers higher job autonomy and/or empowered them to participate in service users' care planning reduced direct care workers' turnover.

In terms of job-related characteristics, higher turnover has previously been found to be related to part-time employment, tenure, work overload, work stress, low levels of support from supervisors and coworkers, as well as satisfaction with training and rewards. There are arguments both for including and excluding job tenure from models of job separation. On the one hand, paying higher wages is expected to reduce separations (and increase tenure), which would suggest that tenure should not be included. On the other hand, if there are seniority wage scales, the exclusion of tenure can lead to biased estimates. In this study, we followed, and, and controlled for tenure as we believe that helps better deal with unobserved heterogeneity, which is an important issue in this context.

### Finding a job in an overcrowded market: getting what you want [^7f902548]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2013). Low credibility.

As the number of fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeons entering the workforce increases, so does the competition for available practice opportunities. The process of finding employment has seemingly become more involved as the relative availability of positions has declined over recent years. To manage this new environment, new graduates need to become much more proactive in the process of seeking and obtaining orthopaedic trauma positions.

### Universal resilience patterns in labor markets [^bcfff23e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Like ecosystems, the cities with adaptable labor markets are best prepared for the future of work. So what makes cities adaptable? This question remains open because the typical study of urban labor at equilibrium obfuscates responses to out-of-equilibrium disruptions. For example, most automation research relies on occupation-level estimates of technological exposure. But, labor markets are heterogeneous systems in which skills, jobs, geographies, and sectors all interact. Accordingly, models built on empirical skills data may better capture worker mobility and better identify the sources of urban adaptability through the interdependencies of workplace skills. Analogous strategies predict resilience to shocks in ecological systems (e.g. changing acidity or temperature levels) from the density of mutualistic interdependencies between species — independent of population dynamics at equilibrium. Similar network models have been applied in a variety of economic systems including global socioeconomic systems, regional economies, banking systems, and interfirm worker mobilitythrough an analogy connecting ecological mutualism to economic complementarity. In these studies, the interdependencies between cities, banks, and firms undergird systemic resilience to shocks even though dynamics in those systems are very different. Despite their success in other economic domains, studies of interdependencies between skills and occupations remain absent from urban labor studies on economic resilience.

How strong is the analogy between labor market resilience and the resilience of ecosystems? To study this question, we first expand existing labor theory using an analogy between the overlapping skill requirements of occupations within a labor market and the mutualistic interactions between species within an ecosystem. Since labor markets and ecosystems may be governed by different dynamics, how can ecological methods apply to labor market resilience? Recent studies demonstrate the prominent role of structure in determining ecological resilience independent of the ecosystem's population-level dynamics. Thus, we ignore the different equilibrium dynamics that govern a labor market or an ecosystem, and we apply analogous measures to occupation networks in US cities constructed from employment distributions and skills data provided by the US Department of Labor. While existing foundational studies have identified similar structures in urban labor markets –, we are not aware of any study empirically relating these economic structures to economic resilience following a labor shock. Thus, we expand this body of work by applying our theoretical framework to measure labor market resilience compared to the unemployment experienced across US cities following the Great Recession. Finally, having empirically validated our measure following an actual labor disruption, we apply our framework to understand the impact of another labor disruption: automation via computerization.

### The paradox of aging population and firm digital transformation in China [^c3d8c147]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and discussions

The main purpose of this paper is to examine the development and changes in the digital transformation process of enterprises in the context of the aging population in mainland China. That is, this paper explored the impact of the aging population on the digital transformation of enterprises. To achieve this purpose, this paper tested and proved the non-linear relationship of the aging population on the digital transformation based on the complex impact of the aging population on the economy and society. In further research, this paper incorporated four moderating variables at the levels of institutional environments (marketization and minimum wage) and corporate strategies (marketing capability and customer concentration) into the model to explore and examined the moderating effects of institutional environments and corporate strategies on the U-shaped relationship.

Main conclusions

The main findings of this paper are as follows: First, different degrees of an aging population can have differential impacts on enterprise digital transformation. This paper found that the aging population inhibits digital transformation within a specific range. However, an aging population beyond a particular scope promotes digital transformation. The differential impact of the aging population involves two processes: elevating labor costs and changing firms' human capital structure. The aging population significantly raises labor costs, which causes firms' hiring costs to rise. According to the theory of limited resources, hiring costs crowd out firms' resources for digital transformation. In addition, according to the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis, the aging population promotes the substitution of high-skilled employees for low-skilled employees in firms and the recruitment of highly-educated employees. According to the theory of human capital externalities, aggregating high-level talent promotes corporate innovation and generates additional benefits and premiums. By changing the human capital structure of enterprises, the aging population promotes the digital transformation. The aging population and digital transformation are U-shaped nonlinear relationships.

### "' Oh gosh, why go?' cause they are going to look at me and not hire": intersectional experiences of black women navigating employment during pregnancy and parenting [^1a1b3918]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The financial stressors expressed by participants in our study are consistent with economic inequities that have long existed for Black people, especially Black women. A higher proportion of Black mothers work, compared to white, Asian, and Latina mothers. Additionally, Black women have higher labor force participation rates than white women across all levels of education. Higher labor force participation rates among Black women are attributed to factors such as the societal expectation of Black women's employment as well as labor market discrimination against Black men leading to lower wages and less stable employment than white men, putting a greater burden on Black women to support their families. For example, a higher proportion of Black mothers (79%) are "breadwinners" (defined as earning at least 40% of a household's income and earnings) compared to Latina (49%), white (48%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (43%) mothers. However, due to a long history of discriminatory hiring practices and exclusionary workplace protections and public assistance policies, Black women are concentrated in low-paying, inflexible service occupations that are excluded from various worker protections and lack retirement benefits, health insurance coverage, and paid sick and maternity leave. Black women in the US are paid, on average, 62 cents for every dollar earned by white men, equaling almost $100,000 in lost wages over the span of a 40-year career. The addition of children further exacerbates income inequity for women, who incur a 4% wage penalty for every child they have, or a 6% wage penalty for every child for those in low-wage jobs.

### Extortion can outperform generosity in the iterated prisoner's dilemma [^19d65522]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In real life, a prisoner's dilemma type setting can exist in many situations. For example, the interaction between a firm and its workers. Suppose that payoffs of the game are such that it is a dominant action in a one-shot interaction for workers to shirk instead of work diligently on the job, and it is a dominant action in a one-shot interaction for the firm to keep the worker's salary the same as before instead of giving a raise. The Press–Dysontheory implies that there are conditional randomized policies that the firm can implement which induces the worker to work diligently, some of which exploit the workers cooperative tendencies. Similar scenarios may exist between an online merchant and its consumers, or a developing country government and its citizens. As artificial intelligence products began to enter our daily life (for example, Siri, Robot, Self-driving cars, and so on), as an algorithm, the ZD strategies might also be applied by firms to maximize their profits. The experimental setting of unawareness, as in Hilbe et al.and our experiments, provides an ideal situation to test the interaction between individuals. However, the game can also be understood as the strategic interaction between countries, firms, or other institutions, or between institutions and human individuals. For an individual, the prospect of interacting with a machine-like opponent is not uncommon. For example, in the competition between a leader firm and a follower firmin a duopoly market, the leader firm can take a rigid policy towards the opponent, similar to a machine. Between the interaction of a state institution and a private entity, the institution may act like a machine. In these two cases, the machine-like player's stature (leader firm or state institution) informs their opponents (follower firm or private sector). In this way, the ZD strategy also can be understood as an institutional (machine-like) strategy.

### The impact of self-insuring for workers' compensation on the incidence rates of worker injury and illness [^76fe5a1e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

There is moderate evidence that workers in experience-rated firms sustain less injuries when compared with workers in firms that are not experience rated. This study aims to provide more insight on this issue.

Methods

Panel data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and National Academy of Social Insurance between 1999 and 2006 were used. A theoretical framework was developed, and a fixed effects vector decomposition model was estimated.

Results

Self-insuring was positively associated with relatively low worker injury and illness incidence rates when compared with insuring (including experience rating and manually rating). After controlling for workforce characteristics, industrial composition, firm size, and state-specific laws, states with an above the median percentage of self-insured firms had incidence rates that were lower than rates in states with a below the median percentage of self-insured firms.

Conclusion

A higher degree of experience rating seems to better align the economic incentive to invest in prevention and the intended outcome of reducing worker injury and illness.

### Immigrant-native pay gap driven by lack of access to high-paying jobs [^1514910b]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market 1–6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress 6–9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant-native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant-native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant-native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training 10–13, job training 13–15, job search assistance programmes 13,15, improving access to domestic education 13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications 18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks 13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant-native pay gap 22–28.

### Unequal exchange of labour in the world economy [^0eb28f09]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Researchers have argued that wealthy nations rely on a large net appropriation of labour and resources from the rest of the world through unequal exchange in international trade and global commodity chains. Here we assess this empirically by measuring flows of embodied labour in the world economy from 1995–2021, accounting for skill levels, sectors and wages. We find that, in 2021, the economies of the global North net-appropriated 826 billion hours of embodied labour from the global South, across all skill levels and sectors. The wage value of this net-appropriated labour was equivalent to €16.9 trillion in Northern prices, accounting for skill level. This appropriation roughly doubles the labour that is available for Northern consumption but drains the South of productive capacity that could be used instead for local human needs and development. Unequal exchange is understood to be driven in part by systematic wage inequalities. We find Southern wages are 87–95% lower than Northern wages for work of equal skill. While Southern workers contribute 90% of the labour that powers the world economy, they receive only 21% of global income.

### Healthy workforce / healthy economy: the role of health, productivity, and disability management in addressing the nation's health care crisis: why an emphasis on the health of the workforce is vital to the health of the economy [^30f488d9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Prevention funding and incentive realignment — policy context — emphasizes that "Today's federal programs pay minimal attention to prevention health services" and that "Public and private investment in sick care (especially low-leverage and end-of-life care) should not be allowed to crowd out higher-leverage investments in prevention that can produce more social benefit for the same cost." It calls for parity by stating "There should be parity in the funding of high value evidence-based preventive services in both public and private programs," and notes that certain benefit designs "actually create disincentives to healing and healthful behavior."

### Investing in healthy human capital [^042ea753]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Although the value of human capital is not captured on company balance sheets, it may account for about half of the gap between a company's market value and book value. Yet, many companies do not focus comparable scrutiny on human capital management as compared with other large assets, nor do they systematically measure its output (ie, productivity). Methods are emerging to enable employers to assess productivity losses, including absenteeism and presenteeism, and to understand the associated costs (ie, direct medical costs, total productivity loss). This will permit employers to assess the value of programs to enhance health and productivity. We contend that the effective workforce is probably decreased by 5% to 10% because of health problems. We believe that employers who increase their investments in healthy human capital now will emerge tomorrow as the companies leading the gains in US productivity.

### Association between wages and nursing staff turnover in Iowa nursing homes [^5c5f1b45]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Covariates

In empirical models, we control for a set of resident- and facility-level characteristics that may affect the relationship between nursing staff hourly wage and turnover, including ADL index, age, percent of female, percent of White, number of beds, occupancy rate, payer mix (percent of Medicare-pay residents and percent of Medicaid-pay residents), staffing levels (defined as the number of staffing HPRD), for-profit status, multifacility organization, urban, and whether located in a competitive market. Occupancy rate is derived from the number of total inpatient days (Worksheet S-3, Part I, Column 7, sum of Lines 1 and 2) divided by a number of bed days available (Worksheet S-3, Part I, Column 2, sum of Lines 1 and 2). RN HPRD is calculated by dividing the sum of paid hours of directly employed RN, contracted RN (Worksheet S-3, Part-V, Line 14), and Nursing Administration by total inpatient days. LPN and CNA HPRD are calculated by dividing the summed paid hours of directly employed staff and contracted labor for each type of staff by total inpatient days. We created a binary measure of market competitiveness based on HHI. Using the number of beds, we define an unconcentrated market as one that has HHI < 0.15. All the regressions also control for three county-level contextual measures: number of nursing home beds per 1,000 older adults as a measure of supply, per capita income (adjusted to 2017 dollars) as a measure of economic health, and the unemployment rate as a measure of local labor market characteristics.

### Higher cost of finance exacerbates a climate investment trap in developing economies [^a4a1fbc9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Country risk premium

The country risk premium reflects the additional premium associated with investing in the equity market in a specific country. It is computed as a difference between the country's average bond yield and the default-free government's bond yield (a bond whose issuer is highly unlikely to default — for example the German or US treasury bonds) — this difference is defined as the country default spread (CDS). When computing the CDS, some countries (Canada, China and Japan) showed a negative spread and we corrected these negative values by arbitrarily setting the CDS equals to zero. The resulting value is then corrected by an adjusting ratio. The adjusting ratio is the proportion between the standard deviation of the equity market and the standard deviation of the bond market. Table 2 reports the country risk premiums across countries and regions.

Table 2
Country risk premiums across countries and regions.

To derive specific low-carbon and high-carbon WACC values, we relied on the Damodaran dataset, which provides beta, equity and country risk premiums, as well as debt-ratio and equity-ratio values at the industry level (namely low-carbon and high carbon sectors); while further detail at technology level is not available.

Modelling tool

TIAM-UCL is the TIMES integrated assessment model (TIAM) developed at the UCL Energy Institute. Based on the TIMES model framework, TIAM-UCL is a partial equilibrium global multi-region technology-rich bottom-up cost optimisation energy system model. It uses a linear programming approach with the objective to maximise consumer surplus. The model represents energy resource extraction through conversion processes (refineries, electricity and heat generation) and infrastructure to end-users in the residential, commercial, industry, transport and agriculture sectors. Assuming perfect competition with perfect foresight over the modelling period, the model designs a cost-optimal transition of the energy system that meets future service demands, while obeying technical, economic and policy constraints.

In addition to the detailed representation of the energy system, TIAM-UCL was selected for this study due to its bottom-up cost-optimisation paradigm. This approach is better suited to addressing the research questions than other modelling alternatives (such as top-down macroeconomic or simulation models) as investment decisions are made based on costs to determine the cost-optimal technology and resource mix, and as the WACCs can be represented as hurdle rates in order to develop the finance scenarios.

### The paradox of aging population and firm digital transformation in China [^16bc1404]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The moderating role of marketing capabilities

Mishra and Modi, based on stakeholder theory, resource base theory, signaling theory, and agency theory, showed that the stronger the marketing capability, the more rapid the flow of information and the more significant the influence of the external environment on corporate strategy. A high level of marketing capability provides a more convenient signaling channel for enterprises, which in turn improves the efficiency of information transmission. While in the short term, companies are more likely to suffer the negative impacts of an aging population on their digital transformation strategies. In time firms with more substantial marketing capabilities increase their hiring of high-level human capital by delivering practical information to the labor market in a more targeted manner, which in turn increases the aggregation of high-level human capital and facilitates the digital transformation of firms. Similarly, companies with strong marketing capabilities are able to respond to the impact of changes in the external environment by quickly realizing the allocation of internal resources and facilitating digital transformation. In summary, we believe that higher levels of marketing capability will amplify the negative impact of aging on firms' digital transformation in the short term. However, in the long run, higher levels of marketing capability will also enhance the positive impact of aging on firms' digital transformation. This dual effect will steepen the slopes on both sides of the U-curve. Additionally, higher levels of marketing capability will shorten the duration of the negative impact of aging and accelerate the onset of its positive impact.

Based on the above analysis, we propose our hypothesis (H3a): higher levels of marketing capability increase the slopes on both sides of the U-curve and move the vertex of the curve to the left.

### Recent trends in neuroradiologist compensation and clinical productivity in academic versus non-academic settings [^0910bcb1]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Awareness of trends in compensation and clinical productivity are important, especially in a competitive market for hiring radiologists. This study shows that in the last decade, clinical productivity as measured by median Work Relative Value Units for academic neuroradiologists remained greater (by 30%-40%) than for academic diagnostic radiologists overall throughout the study period. The median compensation for academic neuroradiologists remains approximately 20% less than that for nonacademic neuroradiologists. The median compensation increased at a faster rate for academic neuroradiologists (4.1% annually) than for nonacademic neuroradiologists (1.8% annually), similar to the trend for diagnostic radiologists overall, but the compensation increase across time has barely kept pace with inflation. Further studies are needed to address cuts in reimbursements for neuroimaging studies and the impact on clinical productivity and physician labor market dynamics.

### It pays to be nice: employer-worker relationships and the management of back pain claims [^8e5cc7a7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the influence that workers' satisfaction with the firm's treatment of their disability claim and their health care provider has on workers' return to work (RTW) following onset of occupational LBP.

Methods

Using a prospective survey on back pain, medical treatment, and workers' satisfaction, we employ nonparametric and logistic analyses to see how satisfaction affects RTW.

Results

Workers' satisfaction with their employer's treatment of their disability claim is more important in explaining RTW than satisfaction with health care providers or expectations about recovery. Dissatisfied workers have worse return to work outcomes because they are more likely to have time lost claims and are more likely to have multiple spells of joblessness.

Conclusions

Workers' RTW is more responsive to their satisfaction with how the firm treated their disability claim than with their satisfaction with the health care provider. Satisfaction of both types plays an important role in determining RTW.

### The stock performance of C. everett koop award winners compared with the standard&poor's 500 index [^023a1d2b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

OTHER STUDIES EXAMINING CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

A comparison of the 5-year performance of socially responsible and non-socially responsible companies to the S&P 500 found that socially responsible companies outperformed their counterparts across different screening and analysis methods. For example, within the biotechnology industry, disclosure of human resources expenditures was found to significantly increase stock prices in the 2 days after the release of an annual report.

Although correlation does not imply causation, a study of the fashion and textile industry offers further support to the connection between social responsibility and business outcomes. The study hypothesized that companies with OHSAS 18001 workplace safety certification would have improved sales figures because consumers are particularly concerned about labor conditions in the fashion and textile industry as a result of previous scandals involving sweatshops and child labor law violations. Sales among certified companies did show significant positive change during the study period, suggesting customers' concerns for worker safety may play a role in creating financial gain among companies with certified health and safety programs. The authors also noted reduced accidents and disruptions, leading to higher product quality and delivery, as possible explanations for the better financial results.

There is some evidence that the relationship between stock performance and employee health and safety programs, and more broad CSR programs, may depend on the statistical methods used in analysis, and that the implementation of successful programs may be the result, rather than the cause, of improved financial performance. More recent studies counter this argument, and suggest that markets favor firms with higher CSR valuebecause they have higher expected growth rates. Finally, CSR companies may be at a particular advantage in times of market volatility. Studies have shown that a reputation for CSR can provide resiliency and protect firms from stock price crashes associated with crisis, even when industry and crash risk factors are controlled.

### Prospects for global sustainable development through integrating the environmental impacts of economic activities [^54c984d6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The demand structure of the model assumes that each country's consumers have a CES utility function. In this case, consumers can choose between domestically produced or imported tradable goods (agriculture, manufacturing) and domestically non-tradable goods (services). It is assumed that there is imperfect substitution between domestic and imported products, following the Armington assumption, meaning that products from different countries are heterogeneous.

The equilibrium in product and factor markets determines the prices of products and factors. Trade costs exist for imports and exports between countries, with tariff barriers being an essential source of trade costs. Specifically, this is reflected in import tariffs (referred to as tariffs) imposed by individual countries. Tariffs affect consumer consumption decisions and firm production decisions through price transmission mechanisms. The import tariff rate for countryimporting productfrom countries is denoted as. The price transmission mechanism is defined as follows:

In the above equation, represents the consumer price of productproduced by countryand consumed by country.represents the production price of productproduced by country.

The model equilibrium is determined by the simultaneous clearing of product markets, factor markets, global trade, and the condition of zero profits in a perfectly competitive market environment. Specifically, under product market clearing, all output is fully consumed, meaning that all produced goods are consumed. Under factor market clearing, the supply of factors equals the demand for factors, ensuring that the quantity of factors supplied matches the quantity demanded. Under trade clearing, global trade is balanced, with the sum of trade imbalances across countries equaling zero. Under the zero-profit condition, the value of production equals the cost of the input factors, ensuring no economic profits in the model. Table 3 provides specific mathematical expressions for market clearing.

### Hiring your next partner: AOA critical issues [^5e471fdc]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Hiring a new partner into an orthopaedic department or group can be a daunting task. A recent American Orthopedic Association symposium sought to address three major aspects of hiring that affect orthopaedic leaders: (1) when to hire-the chairperson's role; (2) generational issues that affect hiring; and (3) the development of an initial compensation package. How does the chairperson recruit new physicians? Hiring a new partner into the academic setting requires a good deal of foresight. There must be an established game plan. Advertising and interviews need to be orchestrated. Chairpersons can find information about candidates from many unique sources. Fit within the department and community is important and must be cultivated. Spouses and families need special attention. Research candidates have individual needs. Perhaps the most important aspect of recruitment is the development of a realistic business plan. This paper provides an overview of factors to consider in managing a new hire. Generational issues are intriguing. Should they affect our hiring practices? It seems clear to established physicians that the new generation of graduates is different from their predecessors. Is this really true? Most everyone is familiar with the terms "Silent Generation", "Baby Boomers", "Generation X", and "Generation Y". Is there anything to be gained by categorizing an applicant? Is it important to hire a replica of one's self? This paper provides a thoughtful overview of generational issues as they apply to hiring new partners. Most department chairpersons are not trained as negotiators. Some preparation and experience are helpful in guiding the process of making an initial offer to a candidate. It is not all about pay. The package includes the guarantee period, expectations for the new hire, mentorship, and resources. How much should new orthopaedic academic hires be paid? Recent benchmark data from the Academic Orthopaedic Consortium suggest a mean income of $282,667 for physicians who have just finished a fellowship. New hires are concerned about call frequency and available time free from work. How much work should be expected from an academic surgeon? Recent survey data from the American Orthopaedic Consortium suggest a mean of 9200 relative value units per year. This article offers some guidelines for the chairperson who needs to formulate an initial offer for a new hire. There is a lot involved in hiring a new partner, as times are changing. This paper offers considerable food for thought about hiring.

### Inequality in economic shock exposures across the global firm-level supply network [^00ff4814]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For centuries, national economies have been engaging in international trade and production. The resulting international supply networks not only increase wealth for countries, but also allow for economic shocks to propagate across borders. Using global, firm-level supply network data, we estimate a country's exposure to direct and indirect economic losses caused by the failure of a company in another country. We show the network of international systemic risk-flows. We find that rich countries expose poor countries stronger to systemic risk than vice-versa. The risk is highly concentrated, however, higher risk levels are not compensated with a risk premium in GDP levels, nor higher GDP growth. Our findings put the often praised benefits for developing countries from globalized production in a new light, by relating them to risks involved in the production processes. Exposure risks present a new dimension of global inequality that most affects the poor in supply shock crises.

### Mitigating unconscious bias in recruitment and hiring [^c29a0112]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unconscious biases in recruitment and hiring can limit the potential for building a diverse academic and private radiology practice. In the private practice environment of radiology, especially in smaller firms, in which a dysfunctional team can lead to a dysfunctional practice overall, it is especially essential to find the best candidates for the team. Many strategies for mitigating these biases can be employed strategically at multiple levels of the hiring process.

### The low-wage labor market: challenges and opportunities for… [^a2630e8a]. aspe.hhs.gov (1999). Low credibility.

What Is the Low-Wage Labor Market. As Bernstein and Hartmann point out, traditional labor theory views all workers as competing together in a single integrated market and being paid according to their marginal productivity. In such a market, low-wage work can provide an opportunity to become employed in a stable job and advance up a career ladder. new entrants to the low-wage labor market, particularly those coming from welfare, may find it difficult to compete with the more highly educated working poor. Bernstein and Hartmann emphasize that these wage declines occurred in spite of increasing education and work experience among workers and increasing returns to human capital. They suggest that at least some of the reason may be changes in institutional factors such as minimum wage laws, macroeconomic monetary policy, the role of unions, and international trade policies.

the large inflow of new entrants into the low-wage sector could put downward pressure on wages
- aggravating the policy concern that many jobs available to welfare recipients will not enable them to work their way out of poverty. Do Minimum Wage Policies Improve Outcomes for Low-Wage Workers. Proponents of raising the minimum wage advocate it as a way of raising the incomes of working poor families. The idea is tempting, given that the legislated increases since 1970 have failed to keep pace with inflation. In inflation-adjusted terms, the minimum wage has fallen by 23 percent since 1970. Opponents of minimum wage increases have long believed that such policies have the disadvantage of reducing job opportunities, because employers will eliminate bottom echelon jobs rather than pay more than those jobs are worth in terms of the additional output they produce.

According to Turner, a majority of the evidence indicates that any negative effects of the minimum wage on employment opportunities are small and occur primarily among teens, a group of less concern in this policy area than are low-wage adults and at-risk groups such as women and minorities. Turner also looks at two other potentially negative consequences of a minimum wage increase. The first is that higher minimum wages could encourage teens to drop out of school to enter the labor market. Turner's reading of the evidence suggests that. The EITC is intended to increase labor force participation by encouraging people to work who otherwise would not be drawn into the labor force at the prevailing wage. Barnow finds that the majority of evidence suggests.

### The 2017 ACR commission on human resources workforce survey [^569815a1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The ACR Commission on Human Resources conducts an annual workforce survey to determine the makeup of the radiology workforce and to identify potential plans for hiring new staff in an attempt to understand our profession better.

Methods

The Practice of Radiology Environment Database group leaders were asked to complete an electronic survey regarding the makeup of their present workforce by subspecialty, as well as the numbers and types of subspecialists hired in 2016 and the numbers and types of subspecialists expected to be hired in 2017 and 2020. They were also asked about midlevel practitioners.

Results

Twenty-six percent of practice leaders (477) representing 11,056 radiologists, 33% of all practicing radiologists in the United States, responded to the survey. The workforce distribution by practice type and radiologists' ages has been relatively stable since 2012. Six percent of the practicing workforce is over the age of 65 years. Sixteen percent of radiologists work part-time, and 21.5% of radiologists are female. The survey results indicate that 1,569 to 2,037 radiologists were hired in 2016. In 2017, 1,826 to 2,370 new job opportunities are anticipated, a 14.1% increase compared with 2016. For 2017, the subspecialists most recruited will be neuroradiologists, general interventionalists, after-hours radiologists, and body imagers. Approximately 2,156 midlevel practitioners are presently working and supervised by radiologists.

Conclusions

The 2017 ACR workforce study shows an optimistic picture and outlook for those seeking jobs as practicing radiologists in 2017. For practice leaders, the market will be much more competitive than it has been in past years.

### Prosociality predicts labor market success around the world [^36e522fb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A large literature points to the importance of prosociality for the well-being of societies and individuals. However, most of this work is based on observations from western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies, questioning the generalizability of these findings. Here we present a global investigation of the relation between prosociality and labor market success. Our analysis uses experimentally validated measures of prosociality and is based on about 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. We show a sizable and robust positive relation between prosociality and labor market success around the world that does not systematically differ across continents or by countries' economic development. These findings generalize the positive relation between prosociality and labor market success to a wide geographical context.

### Unequal exchange of labour in the world economy [^5bdb0954]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given this dynamic, it is clear that the North's development model cannot be universalised, as it relies on appropriation from elsewhere. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the North's current levels of aggregate consumption could be maintained under fair trade conditions. To maintain current consumption, Northern populations would need to substantially increase their working hours (while also committing substantially more domestic land, materials and energy to production), which would be socially and politically difficult to achieve. It is plausible that people would prefer instead to forego some kinds of production (for instance, production of goods for elite consumption) or shift to forms of provisioning that require less labour (e.g. public transit instead of private cars).

Our results also indicate that the global South is drained of a large quantity of productive capacity through unequal exchange (9–16% of its total productive capacity, in terms of labour, is drained in any given year). 826 billion hours of labour in 2021 is equivalent to 369 million workers (assuming 2236 h per worker per year, which is the global South average as presented in Table 1). This is more than the total workforce of the United States and the European Union combined. This quantity of labour could be mobilised to produce housing and nutritious food for communities within the global South, or to build and staff hospitals and schools, thus provisioning for local human needs and achieving necessary development objectives; but instead — because of the squeezing of Southern labour and producers, and because of constraints on the ability of Southern states to develop greater economic sovereignty — it is appropriated to produce within global supply chains that service Northern growth, consumption and accumulation.

### The dementia care workforce: essential to care but large research gaps exist [^88ff3e3c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several approaches that have been undertaken by states to improve pay for CNAs in nursing homes and direct care workers in home and community settings. Given the high share of residents with dementia in nursing homes and a large number of people living with dementia who hire personal care aides, any strategy that increases direct care workers' pay will affect the services received by people living with dementia.
Wage pass‐throughs: A wage pass‐through is an additional allocation of funds provided through Medicaid reimbursement that mandate a specific share of the funds must be used to increase direct care workers' wages. Twenty‐seven states have implemented wage pass‐through programs.
Quality incentive programs: These programs tie incentive payments to nursing homes that meet or exceed quality benchmarks, with the expectation that some of these funds will be used to increase staff wages. States might choose to target dementia care quality.
Appropriating funds to staffing: This approach involves allocating additional state funds specifically for the purpose of increasing nursing home staffing levels.
Direct stipends: States can offer supplemental stipends or payments directly to CNAs and other direct care workers who work in dementia‐specific units or with people living with dementia.

The Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program, which provides federal funds to support the growth of the workforce meeting the needs of older populations, encourages nursing homes to allocate additional Medicaid funding to dementia care initiatives, including higher wages for CNAs who care for residents living with dementia. Other initiatives to improve CNA wages can be implemented directly by nursing homes and home‐ and community‐based providers, such as establishing higher pay rates for staff who provide specialized dementia care and pay raises or bonuses for staff who complete specialized dementia care training or obtain certifications.

While direct wage increases are critical, offering comprehensive benefits like health insurance, paid time off, childcare support, transportation support, and retirement plans are also important in making direct care roles more financially appealing. However, little is known about workers' preferences for different combinations of wages and benefits. Wage pass‐through programs have been evaluated, finding that they succeed in their aims of increasing the wages and staffing of CNAs. However, there have not yet been rigorous analyses of the effectiveness of other policy and organizational strategies to increase direct care workers' pay in achieving the end goal of improving recruitment and retention rates.

### SCAI / ACVP expert consensus statement on cardiovascular catheterization laboratory economics: If the cath lab is your home you should understand its finances: this statement was endorsed by the alliance of cardiovascular professionals (ACVP) in April 2019 [^441e9ce0]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). High credibility.

Cost control in CCL operations — labor is a major CCL expense, which can be minimized by ensuring that all CCL personnel are 'working at the top of the licensure', with down time minimized by preventing late starts, decreasing turnover times, and closing the CCL early on slow days, and overtime minimized by restricting after-hours procedures to those which clearly benefit patients and decrease length of stay; costs of disposable items used in a CCL are unknown to most interventionalists, making physicians aware that alternative products offer equal quality at less cost is often effective in changing their behavior, CCL managers should provide physicians with regular reports on their utilization of CCL time and equipment costs and how they compare to their peers in the same CCL, interventionalists' natural competitiveness may cause outliers to modify their practices, and costs of disposable supplies can be minimized through membership in buying groups, which leverage large numbers of buyers to obtain the lowest discounts from manufacturers.

### Healthy workforce / healthy economy: the role of health, productivity, and disability management in addressing the nation's health care crisis: why an emphasis on the health of the workforce is vital to the health of the economy [^27b01303]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

ACOEM's Seven-Point Action Plan — investment, parity, expanded prevention, and access — states that "A national consensus should be established for investment in programs to assure a healthy, able, and available U.S. workforce," and that programs for prevention and health improvement "should be funded in parity with the way that Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers fund care of the sick," with "parity in the funding of high value evidence-based preventive services" and, "At a minimum, funding for delivery of preventive services to currently employed people as well as the workforce of the future must be put on an equal footing with existing funding mechanisms for sick-care." It adds that health policy makers and others "should go beyond the 'medical' definition of prevention" to include other domains improving workforce health and productivity, and that "Access to evidence-based preventive and early intervention health care must be ensured."

### The individual placement and support (IPS) in pain trial: a randomized controlled trial of IPS for patients with chronic pain conditions [^8bcf6848]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

The IPS in Pain trial was an RCT comparing pain treatment with integrated IPS to TAU. The project was submitted to the Norwegian Regional Ethical Committee, and from there it was referred to the Data Protection Officer at Oslo University Hospital, who approved the study (project number: 2015/14224). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02697656), and a detailed study protocol was published.

Participants and Recruitment

Eligible participants were patients referred to the pain center at the Department of Pain Management and Research at Oslo University Hospital in Norway during the recruitment period (November 2015 through December 2017). The inclusion criteria were: eligible for interdisciplinary treatment, not employed (i.e. on long-term sick leave, receiving benefits because of impaired work capability or disability, or unemployed), expressed desire to work, age 18–65 years, living in Oslo, and ability to answer questionnaires in Norwegian.

All patients referred to the center were informed of the study and invited to participate. Eligible patients who wished to participate received additional information about the procedures and purposes of the study and their right to withdraw at any time, and they provided informed consent to participate.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IPS) or a control group (TAU). The randomization process was described in the study protocol.

The intervention group received job support according to the IPS model from an employment specialist, integrated with the usual interdisciplinary pain treatment provided at the pain center. Two employment specialists were hired at the center during the trial period, specifically in relation to the project. In addition to regular ad hoc meetings, the employment specialists and pain management team had meetings during which they discussed all participants. The employment specialists delivered job support to the participants according to the supported employment fidelity review manual, adhering to the eight principles of IPS: 1) eligibility based on the individual's own choice, 2) focus on competitive employment (meaning jobs in the competitive labor market, that pay regular wages, and that anyone can apply for regardless of disability status), 3) integration of mental health and employment services, 4) attention to individual preferences,) work incentives planning, 6) rapid job search, 7) systematic job development, and 8) long-term individualized support. In line with the IPS methodology, support from the employment specialist could take place in various community settings, at the clinic, or at the workplace (if/when participants were employed).

### Workers' compensation elements in different jurisdictions in the United States [^6faca0e4]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Workers' compensation provider networks — some states certify networks to identify higher-quality and more efficient providers, monitor care and eliminate poor outcomes, and maintain credential surveillance; many states require minimum numbers of entry providers and specialists per county and timely access, employees often can opt out after an employer-control period, and evidence on cost savings and return-to-work impact is limited; PPO participation can reduce physician reimbursement and may attract high-volume, low-quality care, with provider inclusion/exclusion methods poorly defined.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^dc67772c]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pricing as a reflection of value

Pricing based on the R&D costs of one approved molecule does not account for all the others that did not make it to the market. Additionally, while we tend to focus on the successful products in the existing R&D ecosystem, the literature has shown that both successful and failed R&D efforts have generated important scientific knowledge that has improved the efficiency of our R&D system. Put simply, it is impossible to innovate without failure, and it is important to recognize that failures are valuable, too, because what we learn — as an R&D ecosystem — from our failures helps us to eventually succeed.

If we agree that providing sufficient rewards is essential to incentivize biopharmaceutical R&D, what should society pay? Firstly, this may seem a strange question to those who operate in the actual market-based system, because the answer they often encounter is that payers try to pay as little as possible. If faced with enough choices, payers, specifically PBMs in the USA, can simply play companies off against one another and take the best offers. Understandably pre-occupied with their own priorities, none of these individual payers is directly concerned with rewarding innovation from the societal perspective. Innovators are constantly trying to invent something uniquely useful in the hope that they will not face too much competition and will therefore have pricing power. In other words, they want to be able to control the supply of a product that buyers want badly enough to pay the price that the innovator sets, and even where there are a few competitors, companies tend to be savvy enough not to trigger a ruinous price war, which is why it often takes loss of exclusivity and many generic competitors entering the market to drive a drug's price down steeply.

### The impact of temporal hydrogen regulation on hydrogen exporters and their domestic energy transition [^87887ac8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Another limitation of this study concerns the market structure in the Moroccan electricity sector, particularly regarding the integration of renewable energy. While Morocco is progressively moving toward market liberalization, with increasing penetration of renewable electricity and independent power producers, the electricity market is still partially regulated. However, we want to clarify that our study does not model a liberalized market, in which individual market participants maximize their profits in equilibrium. Instead, we assume a central planner's perspective. In a perfectly competitive market with perfect information, free entry and exit, many participants, and no transaction costs or market failures, the equilibrium reached by price-taking firms and utility-maximizing consumers coincides with the solution a benevolent central planner would choose to minimize total system costs. This is consistent with the First Fundamental Welfare Theorem. However, in real-world liberalized markets, these assumptions are often not fully valid: some actors may lack full information, some generators may have market power, and various government interventions can move us away from equilibrium. Despite the fact that the conditions for equivalence between central planner and market outcomes are not fully satisfied in practice, we argue that our study remains relevant for future scenarios, where these conditions may increasingly hold as markets evolve towards liberalization globally –. In this context, we emphasize that the effect of temporal hydrogen regulation on domestic electricity consumers observed in the section Results is only valid where the market design is such that market prices are passed through to electricity consumers.

### Workplace injury rates and firm-level turnover in Montana's oil and gas industry [^d582c19d]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Do workers follow their self-interest by minimizing injury risk in their employment decision? If so, employers could use injury reduction as a recruitment and retention strategy. This study explores whether injury incidence is associated with turnover in Montana's Oil and Gas industry.

Methods

A panel data set of Unemployment Insurance and Workers' Compensation administrative records from 2010 to 2015 was used to model the relationship between turnover and injury claim rates at the firm level.

Results

Total turnover and injury rates were found to be positively related while injury rates and separation rates had no such association. Quarters in which the employer experienced a severe injury had a 3.3 percentage point increase in separation rates.

Discussion

The findings suggest that injured workers contribute to increased turnover, but coworker turnover does not increase with increased injury rates in the firm. Secondary findings suggest a relationship between recent hires and increased injury rates, although further investigation is required.

### Tips for a physician in getting the right job, part XVIII: rejections and offers [^dfcff231]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

If the candidate for a job is rejected, the individual should not necessarily be discouraged. It may be that the position was particularly competitive or that there were factors beyond the control of the applicant. However, it is important that the candidate carefully considers all aspects of the application and interview process for that position to see if anything could be learned from the process. If the applicant is not successful in being given a job offer for multiple positions, then there must be a careful analysis of the reasons. It could be caused by training, communication issues, a competitive job market-especially in that location, a problematic job record, and so on. If the job seeker is given an offer of employment, it is important to carefully consider all aspects of the offer and consider respectful, professional negotiations on some items.

### The paradox of aging population and firm digital transformation in China [^9a87258e]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The moderating role of marketization

At the institutional environment, the extent of government intervention in the economy and the level of development of formal or informal institutions varies considerably across different regions of China. In more market-oriented areas, government intervention is relatively low. Managers' business behavior and market activities are less regulated by the government, and a high level of trust develops in the region, alongside a relatively high level of financial development and foreign investment.

According to signaling theory, information spreads faster in more market-oriented areas, and the more market-oriented a region, the more sensitive firms are to an aging population. Therefore, the negative effects of the early stages of an aging population are more likely to be transmitted to the digital transformation, as firms in more market-oriented regions are more vulnerable to aging population shocks. However, the greater the degree of marketization of the region in which the enterprise is located, the greater the autonomy of the enterprise to engage in business management activities.

When the aging population increases to a certain level, companies cannot cope with labor cost shocks by cutting digital transformation investments. At this point, it is easier for firms in regions with a higher degree of marketization to adjust their corporate strategies, which motivates them to implement digital transformation. In contrast, less market-oriented regions are characterized by relatively high levels of government intervention in the economy, poorer financing and market environments, weak rule of law, and non-transparent government decision-making processes. Faced with the pressure of an aging population, governments often increase corporate taxes to alleviate the fiscal crisis, further hindering digital transformation. In summary, we believe that higher levels of marketization will amplify the negative impact of aging on the digital transformation of enterprises in the short term. However, in the long run, higher levels of marketization will also enhance the positive impact of aging on firms' digital transformation. This dual effect will steepen the slopes on both sides of the U-curve. Furthermore, higher levels of marketization will shorten the duration of the negative impact of aging and accelerate the onset of its positive impact.

Based on the above analysis, we propose our hypothesis (H2b): higher levels of marketization increase the slopes on both sides of the U-curve and move the vertex of the curve to the left.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5eeb57a8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Does the private sector care about AIDS? Evidence from firm surveys in east Africa [^99537623]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to identify the determinants of HIV/AIDS prevention activity and pre-employment health checks by private firms in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.

Design

We used data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys for Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, encompassing 860 formally registered firms in the manufacturing sector.

Methods

Econometric analysis of firm survey data was used to identify the determinants of HIV/AIDS prevention including condom distribution and voluntary counselling and testing (VCT). Multivariate regression analysis was the main tool used to determine statistical significance.

Results

Approximately a third of enterprises invest in HIV/AIDS prevention. Prevention activity increases with size, most likely because larger firms and firms with higher skilled workers have greater replacement costs. Even in the category of larger firms, less than 50% provide VCT. We found that the propensity of firms to carry out pre-employment health checks of workers also varies by the size of firm and skill level of the workforce. Finally, data from worker surveys showed a high degree of willingness on the part of workers to be tested for HIV in the three East African countries.

Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

ACOEM workforce health advocacy — The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) outlines an action agenda emphasizing prevention-focused measures to protect employability and productivity, stating that "Government should preferentially invest in high-impact services that preserve or improve the overall health and function of the workforce." The principles highlighted here include that "Keeping the Workforce Healthy and Productive Is Essential to Keeping the Economy Strong," that "Public Investment in "Better Health" as well as "Better Health Care" Should Advance Beneficial Societal Outcomes, Most Particularly Workforce Health and Productivity," and that "The Workforce will Become Healthier and More Productive Through Prioritized Investment in Evidence-based Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Prevention Strategies." Examples span primary prevention ("Health promotion, health education, safety engineering, hazard recognition, ergonomics and organizational design, nutritional support, prenatal care, immunizations"), secondary prevention ("Screening and early detection programs, health coaching, biometric testing and pro-active work disability prevention programs"), and tertiary prevention ("Disease management, evidence-based quality care management, RTW programs and vocational rehabilitation"), and the page cites an economic return of "as much as $3 per $1 invested."

### Work-related injury burden, workers' compensation claim filing, and barriers: results from a statewide survey of janitors [^696000b4]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For janitors who are not employed by Janitorial Services (NAICS 561720) firms, data from sources other than ESD were needed. To capture janitors directly employed by other types of businesses (e.g. janitors employed in a manufacturing company, janitors employed in agricultural warehouses), we used risk class information from WA WC data. Risk class is a WA‐specific classification system that combines industry and occupation information to group workplaces by similar risk level for industrial insurance purposes. For example, a janitor directly employed by a manufacturing company would have the same NAICS code (industry) as any other employee working for the same firm regardless of occupation, but they would be assigned different risk classes, and the employer would pay WC premiums based on their risk classes. ESD data does not include occupational information, so it cannot be used to differentiate between janitors and those doing non‐janitorial work at the same firm. However, this WC information is only available for injured janitors. Employers pay premiums based on the number of employees by risk class, but the employer account database does not include names or contact information for individual workers. When a worker is injured and files a claim, this information becomes available. We identified janitors from the WC data by risk class 6602 — Janitorial Services and Pest Control, specifically sub‐classes 6602‐03 — Janitorial Cleaning Services, Not Otherwise Classified (N.O.C.), and 6602‐05 — Janitors, N.O.C. This excludes other workers in the risk class such as contract window washing services, residential janitors, pest control, portable cleaning and washing, and street and building decoration workers. The WA WC system is a rich data source and provides name and contact information, as well as language preference data when available. Approximately 5% of the total raw sample data (Table 1) sent to the survey research firm were from WC data (before the addition of union membership rolls, and before data cleaning and sample selection).

The final data source included was membership data from a labor union that represents property service workers (including janitors). A data sharing agreement was established between the union and the survey research firm; name, contact information, and language preference information were sent directly to the survey research firm.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4e104775]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Financial arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^e37fea2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Insurance schemes

There are three principal types of prepaid funding or health insurance schemes, in addition to health care that is paid for via general taxation: social health insurance, community‐based health insurance, and private for‐profit health insurance. Social health insurance schemes are compulsory. Coverage is usually on a national scale but may vary from a specific large group (for example, formal sector employees) to the whole population of a country (Lagarde 2006). Social insurance is usually funded through payroll contributions from employers and or employees, but governments may also contribute (through tax revenue) to cover the poor or unemployed (Carrin 2002; Carrin 2004; Lagarde 2006; Wiysonge 2012). Community‐based health insurance schemes, in contrast to social health insurance, are voluntary (Ekman 2004; Lagarde 2006). They are managed and operated by an organisation other than a government or private for‐profit company. They can cover all or part of the costs of healthcare services (Adebayo 2015). Private for‐profit health insurance works with employer‐based or individual purchase of private insurance plans provided by private companies that compete on a market scheme. The degree of regulation of insurance schemes varies from one country to another, and companies cover part or all the costs of healthcare services depending on the characteristics of the purchased plan or package of services and – where permitted – according to the person's risk profile (Schieber 2006). In addition to deciding what combination of health insurance schemes to use, policymakers must make decisions about the extent to which there are separate insurance schemes for different population groups and the extent to which there is choice and competition among insurance schemes. They must also make decisions about the governance of health insurance schemes, including regulation of private health insurance and regulations regarding who and what is covered (Drechsler 2005).

Purchasing of services

Key decisions that policymakers need to make about arrangements for purchasing services are how to fund service organisations (via fee‐for‐service, capitation, prospective payment, line item budgets, global budgets, case‐based reimbursement, or a combination of these) and how to pay healthcare workers (via fee‐for‐service, capitation, salary, or a combination of these).

### Nonstandard work arrangements and worker health and safety [^939f7ec2]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Arrangements between those who perform work and those who provide jobs come in many different forms. Standard work arrangements now exist alongside several nonstandard arrangements: agency work, contract work, and gig work. While standard work arrangements are still the most prevalent types, the rise of nonstandard work arrangements, especially temporary agency, contract, and "gig" arrangements, and the potential effects of these new arrangements on worker health and safety have captured the attention of government, business, labor, and academia. This article describes the major work arrangements in use today, profiles the nonstandard workforce, discusses several legal questions about how established principles of labor and employment law apply to nonstandard work arrangements, summarizes findings published in the past 20 years about the health and safety risks for workers in nonstandard work arrangements, and outlines current research efforts in the area of healthy work design and worker well-being.

### Who is engaged at work? a large-scale study in 30 European countries [^5f5da78c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim was to investigate differences in the levels of work engagement across demographic and work- and organization-related factors, and their relative importance for work engagement.

Methods

The study was on the basis of a sample of 17,498 male and 17,897 female employees from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey collected in 2015. Linear regression models and dominance analysis were used.

Results

Several significant differences were observed between the levels of work engagement in different demographic and work- and organization-related groups. Employees working in human service occupations reported higher levels of work engagement than employees in other industries. Relatively, occupational group (68%) and industry (17%) contributed most to work engagement.

Conclusion

It is important to focus on enhancing work engagement, particularly among less educated employees, among those with nonpermanent contracts, and in certain occupations.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^c176ca5d]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive evaluation of the value of medicines from a societal perspective as the basis to gauge whether they are worth their cost to society. This evaluation should not be confined to immediate clinical benefits but should be extended to encompass the broad spectrum of advantages conferred by medical interventions in the near and long term to different stakeholders in our society. It is also imperative to incorporate pricing dynamics from competition (both for branded and generic medicines) in this assessment. By adopting this holistic societal approach, the perceived high costs of medicines can be understood and judged in terms of their contributions to the entire economy over the long term, thereby challenging the notion that drug prices are inherently exorbitant. However, for this view to be convincing, we must consider how and why several of the arguments advanced to argue that drugs are overpriced are flawed. For example, arguing that a drug is overpriced if it generates more in profit than it costs to develop ignores the need for a return on investment for an entire portfolio of projects from which few successes emerge. Arguing that drugs are overpriced because patients cannot afford them ignores the important role of insurance plan design in determining drug affordability and access. Also, arguing that drugs are overpriced in the USA because they are cheaper elsewhere fails to consider that other countries are possibly paying too little to support global R&D and are essentially freeriding off the USA's greater ability and willingness to support biomedical innovation.

While it remains appropriate to condemn specific instances of excessive economic "rent-seeking" or even price gouging when companies exploit regulatory or payment system loopholes to keep competitors away, it is wrong to imply that this happens with all medicines. Market flaws are not the same as the whole market being broken: flaws can be fixed without dismantling the whole market.

It is also both naive and harmful to population health to simply point to calculations by HTA bodies and health economists that claim to demonstrate that specific drugs are not cost-effective, without first scrutinizing the underlying methodology to see if it truly reflects all of society's values. We ask readers to consider how some first principles of value assessments might lead to a broader support for medical innovation.

### Why are investors not interested in my radiotracer? The industrial and regulatory constraints in the development of radiopharmaceuticals [^67ff24b9]. Nuclear Medicine and Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Four criteria are essential in the acceptance by investors of new radiopharmaceuticals: the existence of a market and a medical need, the quality of the science and technology behind the new molecule, the feasibility and compliance with regulations and the limited competitive landscape. Potential investors need to get more convincing market evidence, largely beyond the nice preclinical data generated to the point of first discussion. A properly protected compound not jeopardized by earlier published results is a must. A guarantee of an easy and secured source of the ligand is obvious. A safe access to the radionuclide in volumes corresponding to the targeted market is rarely taken into account, but of utmost importance. The evaluation of new drugs by investors will include the evaluation of the real market size for the targeted indication and the position of the drug in the healthcare environment at the time to market. This includes the potential competition with other radiopharmaceuticals, but also with conventional drugs or competitive modalities also at time to market. Both criteria are usually not easily accessible to researchers whose acquaintance remains limited to the scientific and technical part. Starting from this set of information, a first business plan can be deduced based on a best estimate for price per dose and a rough evaluation about the chance and level of reimbursement. In the following most of the events are covered that could jeopardize the development of the drug, focusing on the industrial, economic and regulatory aspects, comprehending the detailed analysis of the currently best available radionuclides.

### Companies that promote a culture of health, safety, and wellbeing outperform in the marketplace [^11acc2da]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that companies distinguished by their commitment to their workforce's health, safety, and well-being outperform in the marketplace.

Methods

To test this, we analyzed the real-world stock market performance of an investment fund of publicly traded companies selected on evidence demonstrating their pursuit of a culture of health, safety, and well-being.

Results

This fund outperformed the market by 2% per year, with a weighted return on equity of 264% compared with the S&P 500 return of 243% over a 10-year period.

Conclusions

Employers, fund managers, and fund investors would be well served by including strategies that assess a company's commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of their workforce when evaluating investments in their enterprise and portfolios.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of an occupational health and safety management system certification program on firm work injury rates in Alberta, Canada [^64ff2955]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study does have limitations. The data used are collected primarily for administrative purposes, such as workers' compensation registration, payment of insurance premiums, and adjudication of work‐related injuries and illnesses claims. Accordingly, there may be bias due to errors in the data and misclassification. Additionally, workers' compensation claims data may underestimate the true rate of work injuries and this could bias the study findings. For example, previous research in the province of British Columbia found that while the majority of work‐related fatalities and injuries were found in workers' compensation data, additional work‐related fatalities and injuries could be found in coroners' reports and hospitalization records. Nonetheless, for underreporting to bias the results away from a null effect (or no effect of COR certification on injury rate reduction), COR firms, while certified, would need to have had a greater underreporting rate than when not certified. Another consideration is the role of financial incentives for COR in Alberta and how that may result in firms potentially discouraging workers to report injuries. Perverse incentives are always a concern in policy and program interventions and while they cannot be completely accounted for as we do not know firms' motivations, they are likely to be minimal here as COR certification itself is not dependent on firm injury rate performance, but rather passing an audit conducted by an external auditor (for large firms where we found effectiveness) which garners an ongoing base 5%−10% premium reduction not linked to claim cost performance. Moreover, COR certification has been found to be effective in reducing injury rates in other provinces that do not offer financial incentives or premium reductions.

Another limitation of the data is how FTE is calculated. FTE is derived using annual estimates of assessable payroll/insurable earnings and industry average earnings. Since there is a limit to the total earnings that can be insured by injured workers, influencing the total insurable earnings an employer may report, and due to the inconsistencies between the industry of the firm and the industry estimate in which the average wages are obtained, FTEs may be fractional and underestimate the true number of employees a firm may employ. Despite this limitation, FTE remains the only measure available in the absence of hours worked.

### Financial incentives of experience rating in workers' compensation: new evidence from a program change in Ontario, Canada [^b693ebbe]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the incentive for primary and secondary prevention associated with experience rating in a retrospective workers' compensation program.

Methods

Panel data on 21,558 firms from 1998 to 2007 were used to estimate the relationship between the degree of experience rating and seven measures of workplace occupational health and safety outcomes. We focused on the impact of a policy change in 2004 in which the degree of experience rating was substantially increased for all firms.

Results

The 2004 increase in experience rating was associated with a reduction in the total, lost-time, no-lost-time, benefit days, permanent impairment, musculoskeletal disorder, and acute trauma claim rates. These observed changes follow secular trends.

Conclusion

The association of experience rating with some claim outcomes and not others in some time periods suggests that firms may focus on claims and cost management practices.

### Consolidation in the dialysis industry, patient choice, and local market competition [^505f640e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The Medicare program insures > 80% of patients with ESRD in the United States. An emphasis on reducing outpatient dialysis costs has motivated consolidation among dialysis providers, with two for-profit corporations now providing dialysis for > 70% of patients. It is unknown whether industry consolidation has affected patients' ability to choose among competing dialysis providers. We identified patients receiving in-center hemodialysis at the start of 2001 and 2011 from the national ESRD registry and ascertained dialysis facility ownership. For each hospital service area, we determined the maximum distance within which 90% of patients traveled to receive dialysis in 2001. We compared the numbers of competing dialysis providers within that same distance between 2001 and 2011. Additionally, we examined the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a metric of market concentration ranging from near zero (perfect competition) to one (monopoly) for each hospital service area. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of different uniquely owned competing providers decreased 8%. However, increased facility entry into markets to meet rising demand for care offset the effect of provider consolidation on the number of choices available to patients. The number of dialysis facilities in the United States increased by 54%, and patients experienced an average 10% increase in the number of competing proximate facilities from which they could choose to receive dialysis (P < 0.001). Local markets were highly concentrated in both 2001 and 2011 (mean Herfindahl-Hirschman Index = 0.46; SD = 0.2 for both years), but overall market concentration did not materially change. In summary, a decade of consolidation in the United States dialysis industry did not (on average) limit patient choice or result in more concentrated local markets. However, because dialysis markets remained highly concentrated, it will be important to understand whether market competition affects prices paid by private insurers, access to dialysis care, quality of care, and associated health outcomes.

### Economic costs of childhood stunting to the private sector in low-and middle-income countries [^83e3e555]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Stunting during childhood has long-term consequences on human capital, including decreased physical growth, and lower educational attainment, cognition, workforce productivity and wages. Previous research has quantified the costs of stunting to national economies however beyond a few single-country datasets there has been a limited number of which have used diverse datasets and have had a dedicated focus on the private sector, which employs nearly 90% of the workforce in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to examine (i) the impact of childhood stunting on income loss of private sector workforce in LMICs; (ii) to quantify losses in sales to private firms in LMICs due to childhood stunting; and (iii) to estimate potential gains (benefit-cost ratios) if stunting levels are reduced in select high prevalence countries.

Methods

This multiple-methods study engaged multi-disciplinary technical advisers, executed several literature reviews, used innovative statistical methods, and implemented health and labor economic models. We analyzed data from seven longitudinal datasets (up to 30+ years of follow-up; 1982–2016; Peru, Ethiopia, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Tanzania, Brazil), 108 private firm datasets (spanning 2008–2020), and many global datasets including Joint Malnutrition Estimates, and World Development Indicators to produce estimates for 120+ LMICs (with estimates up to 2021). We studied the impact of childhood stunting on adult cognition, education, and height as pathways to wages/productivity in adulthood. We employed cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, and conducted comparative analyses using three analytic approaches: traditional frequentist statistics, Bayesian inferential statistics and machine learning. We employed labour and health economic models to estimate wage losses to the private sector worker and firm revenue losses due to stunting. We also estimated benefit-cost ratios for countries investing in nutrition-specific interventions to prevent stunting.

Findings

Across 95 LMICs, childhood stunting costs the private sector at least US$135.4 billion in sales annually. Firms from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific regions had the greatest losses. Totals sales losses to the private sector accumulated to 0.01% to 1.2% of national GDP across countries. Sectors most affected by childhood stunting were manufacturing (non-metallic mineral, fabricated metal, other), garments and food sectors. Sale losses were highest for larger sized private firms. Across regions (representing 123 LMICs), US$700 million (Middle East and North Africa) to US$16.5 billion (East Asia and Pacific) monthly income was lost among private sector workers. Investing in stunting reduction interventions yields gains from US$2 to US$81 per $1 invested annually (or 100% to 8000% across countries). Across sectors, the highest returns were in elementary occupations (US$46) and the lowest were among agricultural workers (US$8). By gender, women incurred a higher income penalty from childhood stunting and earned less than men; due to their relatively higher earnings, the returns for investing in stunting reduction were consistently higher for men across most countries studied.

Interpretation

Childhood stunting costs the private sector in LMICs billions of dollars in sales and earnings for the workforce annually. Returns to nutrition interventions show that there is an economic case to be made for investing in childhood nutrition, alongside a moral one for both the public and private sector. This research could be used to motivate strong public-private sector partnerships to invest in childhood undernutrition for benefits in the short and long-term.

### Electric transmission value and its drivers in United States power markets [^0de9faa2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

For transmission, the number of merchant projects that have been built in a decentralized manner to capture the value of spatial arbitrage in U.S. electricity markets is small. For instance, in PJM, the largest electricity market in the U.S. only 1% of its total transmission capacity is made up by merchant lines. This could be because all lines that would be valuable to the system are built centrally through regulated ISO, RTO, or utility planning processes. Alternatively, it could be because of barriers to capturing the value provided to the system and/or to financing and constructing the project. These results suggest the latter: that there is valuable transmission infrastructure not being built in a centralized or decentralized fashion.

We find that transmission links often have substantial economic value in their ability to increase energy trade and, in turn, reduce congestion. Interregional links (those crossing market or grid seams) are especially valuable and see fairly balanced trade in each direction, emphasizing the broad value of such investments and the importance of interregional planning that jointly accounts for benefits to multiple regions. Further, our scoping-level comparison of transmission infrastructure costs to historical energy market values finds greater value than cost for majority of links, including all cross-interconnect links. At the same time, the limited actual investment in interregional transmission over the last decades suggests that barriers are effectively preventing development of otherwise valuable infrastructure.

Many types of barriers prevent an efficient buildout of transmission. For example, Joskow and Tirole, discuss how deviations away from perfectly competitive markets can interfere with efficient buildout of merchant transmission. Pfeifenberger et al.add discussion on barriers presented by limited, localized transmission planning and the challenge of expanding both the size of the planning region and the types of benefits assessed during planning processes. FERCfocuses on barriers related to (1) regulatory review, including navigation of processes across different states, (2) limits to the locations at which transmission can be built, and (3) the length of time for new transmission to progress from plan to operation, which can take over a decade. The high value of transmission found in our work serves to highlight the cost of these barriers, that is, the potential net value is equal to missed savings. Each of the above citations discuss possible solutions to and implications of these barriers, including institutional reforms to planning, permitting, and cost allocation procedures.

### Alternative valuations of work loss and productivity [^6f64c27f]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In this article, we examine the indirect costs (i.e., work loss and productivity costs) of employee illness from the employer's perspective. We provide a conceptual framework to help employers consider alternative views with regard to assessing indirect costs and valuing the health care they purchase. First, we discuss the matter of perspective and how an employer should view and assess indirect costs. We briefly review current models of measuring indirect costs, and we critique these models. Then we introduce a simple, conceptual framework based on the ideas of health capital and labor productivity, and we lay out the effects of health investment on indirect costs while considering what employees desire and employers can provide. Finally, we offer an agenda for further research.
