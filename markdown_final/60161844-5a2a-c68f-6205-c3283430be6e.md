## Question

A 28-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He is conscious but pale and tachycardic, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 120 bpm. There is evidence of ongoing bleeding from a deep laceration to his thigh. The paramedics report that the accident occurred approximately 45 minutes ago. The trauma team is preparing for further assessment and management. The laboratory is currently processing blood samples, and results from coagulation studies, including viscoelastic testing, are not yet available.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate action regarding tranexamic acid administration for this patient, and should you wait for viscoelastic assessment results before initiating treatment?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to give tranexamic acid now for a 28-year-old man with suspected major hemorrhage after a high-speed MVC, and whether to wait for viscoelastic testing results before starting TXA. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it meets criteria for significant hemorrhage. Then, I should verify the time window for TXA benefit and the cost of delay. Next, I will review guideline positions on empiric TXA without viscoelastic testing. After that, I should examine the evidence base, including CRASH-2 and meta-analyses on timing. Finally, I will consider dosing, safety, and any exceptions before stating a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture: the patient is hypotensive with SBP 90 mmHg and tachycardic at 120 bpm with ongoing bleeding, which meets criteria for hemorrhagic shock and significant hemorrhage. The mechanism and physiology make trauma-induced coagulopathy likely, and the time since injury is about 45 minutes, which is well within the therapeutic window for TXA benefit [^c98a3811] [^1ae861fe].

> Wait, let me verify the time window before I jump ahead. Multiple high-quality analyses show that TXA's survival benefit is time-dependent and diminishes with delay: immediate treatment yields the largest benefit, and every 15-minute delay reduces benefit by about 10% until 3 hours, after which benefit is lost and harm may emerge. The optimal window may be even narrower, with the most pronounced mortality reduction when given within 90 minutes in some analyses, so I should not delay [^0e382c98] [^c317e8cc] [^f39f1798] [^8115da73].

> I need to check guideline direction on waiting for viscoelastic testing. The European trauma guidelines explicitly recommend administering TXA as soon as possible in bleeding trauma patients and explicitly advise not to wait for viscoelastic results; this is echoed by contemporary European guidance and is consistent with the time-sensitive mechanism and the lack of proven benefit from waiting for VHA to confirm hyperfibrinolysis before treatment [^c98a3811] [^729653c1] [^21cb5ab6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the evidence base. CRASH-2 demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and death due to bleeding with early TXA, with the clearest benefit when given within 1 hour and a signal of harm when given after 3 hours. Individual patient data meta-analyses confirm the time-dependent effect and support immediate administration without delay for testing [^ba293814] [^8115da73] [^0e382c98] [^c317e8cc].

> I should confirm dosing and safety. Standard dosing is 1 gram IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 gram IV over 8 hours; this regimen is supported by CRASH-2 and subsequent guidelines. TXA is generally safe without excess thrombotic events in trauma populations, and the main risk is minimal compared with the mortality benefit in this context, so I should proceed with the standard regimen now [^ba293814] [^c98a3811] [^0e382c98].

> But wait, what if viscoelastic testing later shows no hyperfibrinolysis; could that change management retrospectively? The guidelines argue that viscoelastic assays can miss clinically important fibrinolysis and that waiting risks losing the narrow window of benefit; thus, empiric early TXA remains indicated regardless of later VHA results, and VHA can still guide other components of hemostatic resuscitation without delaying TXA [^c98a3811] [^9b4ea328].

> I should double-check for any exceptions. Absolute contraindications are few; active venous thromboembolism would be a reason to avoid TXA, but that is not present here. Otherwise, in trauma with suspected significant hemorrhage, early TXA is indicated even without confirmed hyperfibrinolysis on VHA, and the balance of benefit to harm strongly favors immediate administration in this patient [^c98a3811] [^0e382c98].

> Putting this together, I should act now: administer 1 gram IV TXA over 10 minutes immediately, followed by 1 gram IV over 8 hours, and do not wait for viscoelastic testing results. This aligns with high-grade European trauma guidelines, the time-sensitive mortality benefit demonstrated in CRASH-2 and meta-analyses, and the principle that delays reduce benefit and increase harm in bleeding trauma patients [^c98a3811] [^ba293814] [^0e382c98] [^c317e8cc].

Give tranexamic acid **immediately** [^c98a3811] — do not wait for viscoelastic testing [^729653c1]. The benefit of TXA is **time-sensitive** [^0e382c98] and declines with delay; early administration within 3 hours [^8115da73] reduces mortality without increasing thrombotic events [^ba293814]. Viscoelastic testing can guide later coagulation management but should not delay TXA [^9b4ea328].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting early tranexamic acid administration

- **CRASH-2 trial**: Early TXA (within 3 hours) reduced all-cause mortality and death from bleeding; benefit diminished with delay and was lost after 3 hours [^8115da73] [^0e382c98].

- **Meta-analyses**: Early TXA reduces bleeding deaths by ~30% [^0e382c98]; no excess thrombotic events [^ba293814].

- **PATCH-Trauma**: Prehospital TXA reduced 28-day mortality but did not improve 6-month functional outcomes, supporting mortality benefit without functional gain [^914d00f3].

---

## Role of viscoelastic testing in trauma resuscitation

Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) identifies hyperfibrinolysis and guides targeted therapy, but **results are not immediately available** and should not delay TXA [^c98a3811]. Early TXA is beneficial regardless of fibrinolysis phenotype, and viscoelastic testing can refine later coagulation management [^9b4ea328].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines consistently recommend **early TXA without waiting for viscoelastic results**:

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| European guideline (ABC-T 2023) | Do not wait for viscoelastic results to administer TXA [^729653c1] [^21cb5ab6] |
| European guideline (fifth edition, 2019) | Administer TXA as soon as possible, within 3 hours; do not wait for viscoelastic assessment [^c98a3811] |
| ESICM 2021 | Administer TXA early (< 3 hours) in trauma patients with bleeding or suspected bleeding [^29a79a4e] |
| NAEMSP/ACEP/ACS-COT 2025 | Administer TXA in prehospital setting for adult trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, as early as possible and within 3 hours [^559d8cfa] |

---

## Clinical scenario analysis

This patient has **clear hemorrhagic shock** with hypotension and tachycardia, and active bleeding from a major laceration. The injury occurred ~45 minutes ago, well within the 3-hour window for TXA benefit [^0e382c98]. Waiting for viscoelastic results would risk losing the time-sensitive benefit of TXA [^c317e8cc].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of early tranexamic acid administration

Benefits include reduced mortality, reduced bleeding, and improved hemostasis, with **no increase in thrombotic events** in RCTs [^ba293814] [^0e382c98]. Risks are minimal; no significant increase in thromboembolism or seizures has been observed in trauma populations [^ba293814] [^bdd8838a].

---

## Practical clinical recommendation

- **Immediate action**: Administer TXA now — 1 g IV over 10 minutes, followed by 1 g IV over 8 hours [^c98a3811].

- **Do not wait**: Do not delay for viscoelastic testing; results can guide subsequent coagulation management but should not postpone TXA [^729653c1].

- **Parallel management**: Continue hemorrhage control, resuscitation, and activation of massive transfusion protocol as indicated [^8e6935d7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Administer **tranexamic acid immediately** — do not wait for viscoelastic results. Early TXA within 3 hours reduces mortality and is safe; viscoelastic testing can inform later care but should not delay time-critical therapy [^c98a3811] [^0e382c98].

Antifibrinolytic agents

Recommendation 22

We recommend that TXA be administered to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant haemorrhage as soon as possible and within 3 h after injury at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an i.v. infusion of 1 g over 8 h. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. (Grade 1C)

We recommend that the administration of TXA not await results from a viscoelastic assessment. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid, TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue that is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen. TXA is distributed throughout all tissues, and the plasma half-life is 120 min. The Clinical Randomisation of Antifibrinolytic therapy in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of TXA on death, vascular occlusive events and the administration of blood product transfusion to trauma patients who were bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding. The trial randomised 20,211 adult trauma patients with or at risk of significant bleeding to either TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo within 8 h of injury. The primary outcome was in-hospital death within 4 weeks of injury. All analyses assessed the intention-to-treat population. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with TXA by 1.5%; the risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced by 0.8% and a reduction in bleeding deaths by one third, mainly through preventing exsanguination within the first 24 h. Paediatric patients were not included in the CRASH-2 study; however, an ongoing study is investigating the use of TXA in children and a study in children undergoing craniosynostosis surgery administered an initial bolus of 15–30 mg/kg followed by 2−10 mg/kg/h. One retrospective study has suggested that TXA is of no benefit in patients with viscoelastic hyperfibrinolysis and another found TXA to reduce multiple organ failure and mortality in severely injured shocked patients. This discrepancy is probably attributable to methodological limitations.

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^46e28c2f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The final algorithm is presented in figure 1 and is divided into two sections: a checklist to direct the assessment and treatment of the patient with an accompanying decision tree to guide administration of hemostatic agents as needed. This has been designed for easy reproduction on posters to be displayed in the emergency department or on cards for physicians to carry with them for reference. The algorithm is color-coded throughout, according to the bleeding severity and SLT results, to aid with quick reference.

Figure 1
Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-related bleeding without the use of viscoelastic testing. The algorithm consists of two parts: (A) a checklist to guide assessment and treatment of the patient and (B) a decision tree to guide administration of hemostatic agents.

The checklist begins with basic patient management and initial SLTs, followed by obtaining the patient history, with particular reference to potential known bleeding complications such as prescribed oral anticoagulants. A treatment protocol is then detailed, based on initial coagulation factor concentrate administration followed by the potential to escalate treatment to include a massive transfusion protocol. Tranexamic acid is suggested for early administration, in line with current treatment guidelines, followed by fibrinogen administration in line with the publication by Schlimp et al. For fibrinogen, dosing can be based on weight, or the decision tree (figure 1B) can be used to guide dosing based on base excess and hemoglobin levels instead of estimating the appropriate dose required. We recommend basing the fibrinogen dose on these parameters as this takes into account the extent of the trauma. Additionally, base excess and hemoglobin levels will have been determined as part of the routine blood gas analysis; as such, results will be available within minutes, and clinicians will be experienced in obtaining and interpreting the results.

Viscoelastic Hemostatic Assays

Hyperfibrinolysis, which is inhibited by TXA administration, is prevalent in roughly 15% of trauma patients upon arrival to hospital and can be assessed with point-of-care viscoelastic testing. Hospital-based studies have used viscoelastic testing as a tool to identify targeted resuscitation strategies in patients at-risk for or in hemorrhagic shock. Importantly, with respect to the use of viscoelastic testing, as stated in the article by Borgman, "While it seems logical that TXA may most benefit individuals who have a hyperfibrinolytic phenotype following trauma, there is no evidence to support this claim". Our search did not identify any analysis that directly assessed prehospital use of viscoelastic testing to identify hyperfibrinolysis and guide prehospital use of TXA. Considering this significant lack of evidence, we cannot make an evidence-based recommendation regarding the utility of viscoelastic testing in the prehospital setting. We believe this is an area where future research can establish helpful guidance.

The role of prehospital TXA in pediatric trauma patients with clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock is unclear and standard dosing has not been established. If used, it should be given within 3 hours of injury.

Evidence guiding the use of prehospital TXA in pediatric trauma patients is scarce. Due to challenges with protocol design, pediatric patients were excluded from the large landmark in-hospital trials, CRASH-2 and CRASH-3. Further, the lowest age cutoff identified in any of the studies reviewed for this manuscript was 15 years. The 2023 Pediatric Trauma Hemorrhagic Shock Consensus Conference reviewed evidence limited to four retrospective studies and one prospective observational trial. All these studies looked at patients who received TXA in the hospital and not prehospital, so their application to the prehospital environment is unclear. The review included two retrospective studies in combat settings and one prospective civilian US study that found association with improved mortality, and two retrospective civilian studies found no benefit. – There is clearly a need for further investigation of the role of TXA in pediatric trauma patients in general and in the prehospital environment to clarify appropriate timing, dose, and patient selection.

### Viscoelastic coagulation monitoring for tranexamic acid: personalised antifibrinolytic dosing? [^3e7e9ee1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Ex vivo viscoelastic testing can be used to assess the concentration responses to tranexamic acid in blood samples obtained from pregnant women across the three trimesters and in non-pregnant controls. Minor variations in fibrinolysis across pregnancy suggest a target tranexamic acid blood concentration of 12.5 mg L⁻¹ for complete inhibition of fibrinolysis. Although the data support the potential utility of viscoelastic testing using the ClotPro® TPA test in maintaining therapeutic tranexamic acid concentrations during postpartum haemorrhage, it might obscure potentially crucial endogenous fibrinolysis inhibitor interactions essential to the microcirculation.

Background

Exsanguination still remains the leading, preventable cause of early mortality in trauma patients. Acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) aggravates hemorrhage as data already showed over a decade ago.

State-of-the-art early resuscitation strategies as proposed by current trauma guidelines aim beside stabilization of oxygenation and perfusion at restoring a physiological clotting capability. Administration of blood products should use fixed, predefined ratios of packed red blood cells (pRBC), plasma and platelets. Hemostatic agents can be used in predefined empiric treatment strategies or guided by goal directed therapy. Those strategies have been well adopted in German trauma centers in the last decade.

Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor reaching critical low levels. Decreased fibrinogen levels have been reported in up to 40% of hypotensive trauma patients. Since early hyperfibrinolysis may contribute to this effect, a rapid use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) is recommended. However, there are common different states of fibrinolysis, i.e. hypofibrinolysis representing an impaired activation of the fibrinolytic system or even fibrinolysis shutdown representing an inhibition beyond a physiologic level after activation of the fibrinolytic system. TXA is associated with increased mortality when given to patients with physiologic levels in fibrinolysis and no benefit in patients in fibrinolysis shutdown. Patients received TXA may even have an increased risk of fibrinolysis shutdown.

The fifth edition of the European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommends TXA to be administered to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemorrhage as soon as possible and within 3 h after injury at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an i.v. infusion of 1 g over 8 h (GoR 1A). Protocols for the management of bleeding patients should consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital (GoR 1C) without waiting for results from a viscoelastic assessment (GoR 1B). The valid German Level-3 guideline on treatment of patients with severe/multiple injuries recommends, for profusely bleeding patients, TXA must be administered as soon as possible, with 1 g over 10 min and then followed as needed with an infusion of 1 g over 8 h (GoR A). For profusely bleeding patients, prehospital administration of TXA can be worthwhile (GoR 0). In both guidelines, bleeding is not defined by specific values of vital signs like blood pressure.

### Improved outcome with individualised antifibrinolytic therapy: what is the evidence? [^bd735eb6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Viscoelastic haemostatic testing (VHT) has been used to determine hyperfibrinolysis and hypofibrinolysis. When modified by addition of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), VHT has been suggested to assess responses to antifibrinolytic therapy and to estimate the concentration of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Despite some evidence that tPA-modified VHT might allow individualisation of antifibrinolytic therapy, further studies are warranted to prove its clinical benefit for postsurgical bleeding, transfusion of blood products, and thromboembolic events.

### Tranexamic acid for acute intracerebral haemorrhage growth based on imaging assessment (TRAIGE): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^fdcb57e3]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study included its double-blinding, allocation concealment, high adherence to treatment protocol and very few missing data on primary outcome. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. Some limitations should also be noted. First, it was prematurely stopped with 85% of the planned sample enrolled so the analysis was underpowered. However, as our results highly coincided with other similar trials, our estimates were likely to indicate a true effect. Second, patient outcome may have been confounded by concomitant use of additional agents (blood-lowering therapy, osmotic therapy, statin therapy, etc), which could influence the outcome through unexplained mechanisms. Third, the median delay from arrival at the hospital to treatment of 170 min may have extended the time to treatment, though still within the prespecified time window. As several studies suggested that treating early may be more applicable for haemostatic treatment, this may have limited our findings.

In summary, among patients susceptible to haematoma expansion treated within 8 hours of onset, tranexamic acid did not significantly prevent the growth of ICH. Larger studies with more specified population and very early treatment are needed to further assess safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid in patients with ICH.

### Tranexamic acid use in prehospital uncontrolled hemorrhage [^26267339]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of trauma patients was relatively unexplored until the landmark Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage-2 (CRASH-2) trial in 2010 demonstrated a reduction in mortality with the use of TXA. Although this trial was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study incorporating > 20,000 patients, numerous limitations and weaknesses have been described. As a result, additional studies have followed, delineating the potential risks and benefits of TXA administration. A systematic review of the literature to date reveals a mortality benefit of early (ideally < 1 hour and no later than 3 hours after injury) TXA administration in the treatment of severely injured trauma patients (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, heart rate > 110). Combined with abundant literature showing a reduction in bleeding in elective surgery, the most significant benefit may be administration of TXA before the patient goes into shock. Those trials that failed to show a mortality benefit of TXA in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock acknowledged that most patients received blood products before TXA administration, thus confounding the results. Although the use of prehospital TXA in the severely injured trauma patient will become more clear with the trauma studies currently underway, the current literature supports the use of prehospital TXA in this high-risk population. We recommend considering a 1 g TXA bolus en route to definitive care in high-risk patients and withholding subsequent doses until hyperfibrinolysis is confirmed by thromboelastography.

### Best timing of tranexamic acid administration for bleeding after trauma or childbirth remains to be established [^9e71fa99]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Haemorrhage is worldwide the leading cause of maternal deathand an important cause of death after trauma. Antifibrinolytic drugs inhibit the lysis of a fibrin clot and are, therefore, used to stop or prevent haemorrhage. Intravenous administration of tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of death due to haemorrhage after traumaand the risk of death due to postpartum haemorrhage. Previous analyses have suggested that tranexamic acid needs to be administered early after the start of haemorrhage, because effects of delayed administration might be absent or even harmful for patients suffering life-threatening bleeding. A recent systematic review and individual patient-level data meta-analysis was set up to quantify the effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness of antifibrinolytics.

This individual patient-level data meta-analysis was registered within PROSPERO and it adhered to the recognised protocols for systematic reviews and meta-analysis from The Cochrane Collaboration and the reporting guideline Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). It included randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCT) with more than 1000 patients with traumatic or postpartum haemorrhage; the authors argue that smaller studies have a lack of power and a risk of selection bias. The primary outcome for the meta-analysis was absence of death from bleeding. 'Treatment delay' was the exposure of interest and defined as the interval between bleeding onset and start of tranexamic acid treatment, or, if not available, as interval between birth and randomisation. The interaction between 'treatment delay' and treatment effect was examined in logistic regression models with absence of death from bleeding as the independent variable and various combinations of dependent variables: treatment, 'treatment delay' and its square, interaction terms for treatment with 'treatment delay' and its square, age, systolic blood pressure at randomisation and study.

### Open, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of cardiac output-… [^0e42d2a2]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

National Emergency Laparotomy Audit Objectives To establish whether minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring to guide protocolised administration of intra- venous fluid during and for up to six hours after major emergency bowel surgery will increase the number of days alive and out of hospital within 90 days of randomisation. Number of patients 3138 patients Inclusion criteria Patients aged 50 years and over undergoing an expedited, urgent or emergency major abdominal procedure on the gastrointestinal tract eligible for inclusion within NELA. Exclusion criteria Refusal of patient consent, clinician refusal, abdominal. 105 months FLO-ELA protocol v5. 0 14 November 2024 8 4 INTRODUCTION Emergency abdominal surgery on the gastrointestinal tract is a common major surgical procedure performed for life-threatening abdominal conditions related to underlying cancer, infection or previous surgery.

It is performed on over 30, 000 patients in England and Wales each year and has. a particularly high burden of postoperative morbidity and mortality, with a 90-day postoperative mortality rate of 20% in those aged 50 and over. The critical need to improve the care of patients undergoing this procedure has been recognized by the establishment of a national audit of care and outcomes in this patient group and a number of national quality. It is accepted that intra-venous fluids given during and after surgery have an important effect on patient outcomes, in particular following major gastrointestinal surgery. Yet they are commonly prescribed to subjective criteria leading to wide variation in clinical practice. One possible solution is the use of cardiac output monitoring to guide intra-venous fluid dosing as part of a haemodynamic therapy algorithm.

This approach has been studied for many years and has been shown to modify inflammatory pathways, and improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation. A Cochrane review of this intervention was recently updated, incorporating the largest contemporary trial in this area to date. Complications were less frequent among patients treated according to a hemodynamic therapy algorithm and a reduced duration of hospital stay. There was a non-significant reduction in mortality at longest follow-up. Despite this suggestion of benefit in elective surgery, these findings are not generalisable to patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Patients requiring emergency bowel surgery have. fundamental pathophysiological differences from elective patients.

These include acute inflammation, sepsis, bleeding, and fluid disturbances which may be established before surgery even begins. They therefore have similarities with critically ill patients, in whom the evidence base for fluid resuscitation based on cardiac output monitoring is very uncertain. There is a lack of dedicated studies of this treatment. FLO-ELA protocol v5. 0 14 November 2024 9 These data highlight the uncertainty surrounding the possible benefits of peri-operative haemodynamic therapy algorithms in emergency bowel surgery and the need for a definitive large multi-centre clinical trial to resolve this. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effects of peri-operative haemodynamic therapy. guided by cardiac output on the number of days spent alive and out of hospital by patients following major emergency bowel surgery.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: how should we use it? [^fcfb69f3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

### How I manage major hemorrhage [^dd20e99c]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute hemorrhage can be a life-threatening emergency that is complex in its management and affects many patient populations. The past 15 years has seen the introduction of comprehensive massive hemorrhage protocols, wider use of viscoelastic testing, new coagulation factor products, and the publication of robust randomized controlled trials in diverse bleeding patient populations. Although gaps continue to exist in the evidence base for several aspects of patient care, there is now sufficient evidence to allow for an individualized hemostatic response based on the type of bleeding and specific hemostatic defects. We present 3 clinical cases that highlight some of the challenges in acute hemorrhage management, focusing on the importance of interprofessional communication, rapid provision of hemostatic resuscitation, repeated measures of coagulation, immediate administration of tranexamic acid, and prioritization of surgical or radiologic control of hemorrhage. This article provides a framework for the clear and collaborative conversation between the bedside clinical team and the consulting hematologist to achieve prompt and targeted hemostatic resuscitation. In addition to providing consultations on the hemostatic management of individual patients, the hematology service must be involved in setting hospital policies for the prevention and management of patients with major hemorrhage.

### Viscoelastic haemostatic assay augmented protocols for major trauma haemorrhage (ITACTIC): a randomized, controlled trial [^2065490a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient population

Adult trauma patients were enrolled if they presented with clinical signs of bleeding activating the local MHP and if RBC transfusion had been initiated. Participants had to be randomized within 3 h of injury and maximum of 1 h after admission to the emergency department. There were no additional exclusion criteria.

Consent for initial enrolment in the trial was provided on behalf of incapacitated patients by a nominated consultee, usually an independent clinician in charge of patient care. Subsequent consent was given by a personal consultee (e.g. a family member) when identified and able to go through the informed consent process. Individual informed consent was subsequently obtained if the patient regained the physical and mental capacity to provide such consent. If the patient died or was otherwise unable to give consent, previous nominated professional or personal consultee consent remained in effect. Patients who subsequently withdrew their consent were removed from the trial.

Randomization and blinding

Enrolled patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the VHA or the CCT groups, with block randomization by the centre. Randomization codes were generated and secured by an independent statistician. Block size was unknown to on-site study teams. Group allocation was by study personnel opening the numbered opaque sealed envelope in sequence taken from a stack held by each study site. Once an envelope had been opened, the subject was considered enrolled. The trial was un-blinded to the treating clinical teams, while research personnel collecting subsequent safety and outcome data were blinded to group allocation.

Procedures

All patients received their local hospital's standard MHP, based on the empiric delivery of tranexamic acid; blood components delivered in a 1:1:1 ratio of RBCs, plasma and platelet transfusions; and limited infusion of crystalloid fluids. In both groups, blood was drawn for coagulation analysis at baseline and after every four units of RBCs transfused, until haemostasis. In the CCT group, these were the conventional coagulation tests performed in the laboratory, while in the VHA assays, analyses were performed at the point of care. Haemostatic therapy was delivered based on results of these according to the TACTIC algorithms, which define triggers for additional administration of platelet, fibrinogen, plasma and antifibrinolytic therapies.

Considerations for Implementation

Tranexamic acid is likely safe; however, the available evidence is conflicting, and the benefit of TXA remains unclear. Accordingly, there are some very important unknowns associated with its prehospital application. One glaring unknown is the lack of clear parameters (physiologic or injury) that identify patients who might benefit most or those who may possibly be harmed by receiving TXA. There is also limited understanding of the impact of the current variable dosing strategies. Future research should continue to investigate these critical questions. If TXA is used in the field, there are a few important guiding principles. First, protocols should emphasize lifesaving interventions before consideration of the administration of TXA. Second, TXA should be administered as soon as possible after the traumatic injury in patients who meet criteria and should not be administered beyond 3 hours postinjury. Finally, the use of TXA should be part of a collaborative effort that includes local and regional trauma centers as part of guideline development and a thoughtful quality assurance program. Given the limited and conflicting data, agency leadership should carefully consider their unique characteristics including available resources such as training time and priorities, scope of available clinicians, proximity to trauma centers, and usual patient population when deciding whether to implement TXA.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^b1819ec9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although we have made significant advances in the understanding of trauma-induced coagulopathy, there is still lack of clarity regarding links between diagnostic and laboratory coagulation testing and clinical bleeding risk. It is therefore evident that there is still significant controversy as to how best to manage trauma patients with severe injury and hemorrhage, including which patients would benefit most from TXA administration. At present, there is no definitive evidence to support efficacy of prehospital TXA administration in improving trauma outcomes. Data are lacking regarding which trauma patients might benefit, optimal dosing and timing and potential complications in the prehospital setting. Prehospital TXA protocols have not been adopted in most trauma centers. If prehospital TXA protocols are desired, issues to consider include time to definitive trauma care, feasibility of TXA intravenous administration, and how best to determine which patients would potentially benefit in the prehospital phase. The ongoing prehospital and in-hospital TXA randomized trials will provide additional high-quality evidence to support optimal clinical protocols for TXA use in the future. At present, the focus of prehospital care of the bleeding trauma victim should be hemorrhage control, hemostatic resuscitation and rapid transport to definitive hemorrhage control and definitive trauma care.

### Effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytics in acute severe haemorrhage: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 40 138 bleeding patients [^e1e17d5b]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

These findings have various implications for clinical care. Bleeding patients should receive antifibrinolytics as soon as possible for three reasons. First, most deaths from haemorrhage occur within hours of bleeding onset. By reducing bleeding, tranexamic acid has the potential to prevent the hypoxia and acidosis that accompanies severe bleeding, but it must be given before tissue damage is irreversible. Second, the benefit of tranexamic acid treatment appears to decrease with increasing treatment delay. Third, we found no evidence of adverse effects associated with tranexamic acid treatment, so it can be given safely as soon as bleeding is suspected. Given the importance of early treatment, time from bleeding onset to treatment should be audited with feedback provided to health-care professionals. National or regional quality improvement initiatives, with best practice benchmarking of time to treatment, might improve survival.

We found nine ongoing trials of antifibrinolytics in acute severe bleeding. Two of these will provide additional data on the effect of treatment delay in severe extracranial bleeding. Because the data from these two trials will increase the number of participants by only 5%, it is unlikely that they will have a material effect on our conclusions. Nonetheless, ongoing trials should deepen our understanding of the safety and effectiveness of antifibrinolytics in traumatic and spontaneous intracranial bleeding, which are major causes of death and disability worldwide. Our review protocol also proposed an analysis of the extent to which the balance of benefits and harms of antifibrinolytic treatment vary with baseline risk. These results will be reported in a future publication.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^192e24d0]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications of the study

The main clinical implication of these results is that tranexamic acid treatment should be considered as an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding. Because of the large number of patients in the low- and intermediate-risk groups, these groups contribute a large number of bleeding deaths. Indeed, about one-quarter of deaths from bleeding occurred in patients who initially appeared to have a low risk of death. Early identification of bleeding can be challenging, especially in trauma. Patients without obvious bleeding sometimes have concealed bleeding and can suddenly deteriorate. Although early identification of bleeding by a CT scan or FAST (Focused Assement with Sonography for Trauma) vel is a priority, a definitive diagnosis can take up to 1 h, even in the best trauma systems. Hence, many major trauma patients without clinically apparent bleeding will not receive tranexamic acid soon enough unless early treatment is given to all major trauma patients whatever their apparent risk. Major trauma is usually defined as an injury or a combination of injuries that are potentially life-threatening or could lead to long-term disability. Because the full extent of the patient's injuries is unknown at initial assessment, trauma team activation criteria represent a pragmatic alternative definition of major trauma in the prehospital setting. As for obstetric bleeding, WHO guidelines recommend tranexamic acid in addition to standard care for all women with clinically diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage. However, if 'in addition to' is taken to mean that tranexamic acid should be given after standard care has been found to be insufficient to stop the bleeding, this will result in unnecessary treatment delay. Instead, we believe that early tranexamic acid treatment should be considered integral to standard care.

Future studies

We found 13 ongoing trials of antifibrinolytic drugs in acute severe bleeding. Three of these could provide additional data on the treatment effect by baseline risk in extracranial bleeding. However, these ongoing trials are small and their inclusion is very unlikely to change our conclusions. However, additional trials could increase the power to detect adverse effects. Further individual patient level data meta-analyses that consider vascular occlusive events are needed.

In June 2011 the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products sponsored an international consensus conference on transfusion and trauma. A panel of 10 experts and two external advisors reviewed the current medical literature and information presented at the conference by invited international speakers and attendees. The Consensus Panel addressed six specific questions on the topic of blood transfusion in trauma. The questions focused on: ratio-based blood resuscitation in trauma patients; the impact of survivorship bias in current research conclusions; the value of nonplasma coagulation products; the role of protocols for delivery of urgent transfusion; the merits of traditional laboratory monitoring compared with measures of clot viscoelasticity; and opportunities for future research. Key findings include a lack of evidence to support the use of 1:1:1 blood component ratios as the standard of care, the importance of early use of tranexamic acid, the expected value of an organized response plan, and the recommendation for an integrated approach that includes antifibrinolytics, rapid release of red blood cells, and a foundation ratio of blood components adjusted by results from either traditional coagulation tests or clot viscoelasticity or both. The present report is intended to provide guidance to practitioners, hospitals, and policy-makers.

Bleeding resuscitation and transfusion thresholds — initial measures and targets: Aggressive volume resuscitation using intravenous isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% NaCl or Ringer's lactate is recommended, and patients with symptomatic anemia or active bleeding should receive RBC transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL; in underlying coronary artery disease, particularly acute coronary syndromes, guidelines recommend a target hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL. Platelets should be transfused to maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and cryoprecipitate to maintain a fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL. For patients requiring ≥ 3 units of packed RBCs within 1 hour, activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be considered; protocols vary and many centers use goal-directed transfusion with TEG or ROTEM. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored; if abnormal, administration of calcium is indicated. Early administration of tranexamic acid for trauma patients within the first 3 hours is associated with decreased bleeding and overall mortality and should be considered, and the writing committee recommends further resuscitation using a goal-directed strategy guided by laboratory results.

### Management of traumatic haemorrhage – the US perspective [^34d345a2]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

As compared with European practice, the American approach to resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhage de-emphasises pre-hospital interventions in favour of rapid transport to definitive care; limits initial surgical interventions under the damage control model; uses crystalloid as the initial fluid of choice; and follows an empiric 1:1:1 approach to transfusion with red cells, plasma and platelets in hemodynamically unstable and actively bleeding patients. The use of bedside visco-elastic testing to guide coagulation support is not as widespread as in Europe, while the early administration of tranexamic acid is more selective.

### The impact of prehospital tranexamic acid on mortality and transfusion requirements: match-pair analysis from the nationwide German traumaRegister DGU ® [^36cae609]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Around a quarter of patients in the control group reached ER in shock without prehospitally receiving TXA. This might indicate that widespread use of TXA has not been reached in the mature trauma system of Germany yet, since a relevant proportion of patients might not have received the medication formally indicated.

A relevant portion of patient in the control group received a first dose of TXA after ER admission (control 35.1.9%, TXA 32.9%). Taking the duration of the prehospital phase into account (control mean 77 ± 32 min), most of the patients were within in the cutoff for higher survival defined by CRASH-2 (survival benefit < 3 h). At the same time, CRASH-2, reinforced by data of CRASH-3, describes a dynamic time-to-treatment relationship favoring an early potentially prehospital administration.

There was increased risk of thromboembolism in the TXA group as potential risk of TXA use, like reported in the MATTERS-study and more recently in the HALT-IT-trial, where actually a higher dosage was used.

Several limitations of the present study must be addressed since data are derived from a registry. Unlike in a prospective study, not every possible outcome-relevant variable can be controlled. The propensity matching in this study can therefore only show an association of the prehospital TXA administration with the observed effects in the groups. A direct causation cannot be shown for methodological reasons. The effects could, for example, also result from differences in clinical treatment standards between the trauma centers involved.

The available data in the registry also have limitations.

First, laboratory parameters with respect to hyperfibrinolysis or inflammation (e.g. D-dimers, interleukin-6) are not available in the database. Viscoelastic testing which can reveal the coagulopathic state is not specifically documented. Therefore, it remains unclear how many patients effectively have been in a hyperfibrinolytic state. Second, the documentation of data was partly incomplete and inconsistent with respect to morbidity (organ failure, sepsis, thromboembolism). There is some further limitation because exact timing of prehospital TXA administration and dosages of TXA have not been documented. It can be assumed that dosage mainly followed current guidelines (1 g i.v. TXA en route to hospital) but there is no nationwide standard (SOP) and at the discretion of the emergency physician.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^e2df2517]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Fibrinogen and antifibrinolytics in cirrhosis — thresholds, diagnostic limits, and prophylaxis: Plasma fibrinogen levels < 100 mg/dL are associated with spontaneous and procedure-related bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, and in a case series of critically ill surgical patients without cirrhosis, a fibrinogen level of ≥ 100 mg/dL resulted in greater mechanical clot stability compared to lower levels of fibrinogen. Diagnostic laboratory tests for hyperfibrinolysis are not readily available in clinical practice, current viscoelastic testing is not sensitive for moderate or mild hyperfibrinolysis, and the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolytic postprocedural bleeding is made clinically with typical manifestations including continuous venous oozing from skin puncture sites and persistent mucosal or submucosal bleeding. The text notes that elective procedures should be delayed during states of clinically apparent pathological fibrinolysis and that, until further supportive data are published, the prophylactic use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid to prevent procedural bleeding cannot be recommended; moreover, a high-dose tranexamic acid trial in acute gastrointestinal bleeding showed no reduction in death or bleeding and a subgroup analysis showed the risk of VTE events to be higher in patients with cirrhosis receiving tranexamic acid. The authors also state, "Therefore, correction of plasma fibrinogen to levels > 100 mg/dL using cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen".

### Effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytics in acute severe haemorrhage: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 40 138 bleeding patients [^0e382c98]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Antifibrinolytics reduce death from bleeding in trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. We examined the effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness of antifibrinolytics.

Methods

We did an individual patient-level data meta-analysis of randomised trials done with more than 1000 patients that assessed antifibrinolytics in acute severe bleeding. We identified trials done between Jan 1, 1946, and April 7, 2017, from MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, PubMed, Popline, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The primary measure of treatment benefit was absence of death from bleeding. We examined the effect of treatment delay on treatment effectiveness using logistic regression models. We investigated the effect of measurement error (misclassification) in sensitivity analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016052155.

Findings

We obtained data for 40 138 patients from two randomised trials of tranexamic acid in acute severe bleeding (traumatic and post-partum haemorrhage). Overall, there were 3558 deaths, of which 1408 (40%) were from bleeding. Most (884 [63%] of 1408) bleeding deaths occurred within 12 h of onset. Deaths from post-partum haemorrhage peaked 2–3 h after childbirth. Tranexamic acid significantly increased overall survival from bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.33; p = 0.001), with no heterogeneity by site of bleeding (interaction p = 0.7243). Treatment delay reduced the treatment benefit (p < 0.0001). Immediate treatment improved survival by more than 70% (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.42–2.10; p < 0.0001). Thereafter, the survival benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 min of treatment delay until 3 h, after which there was no benefit. There was no increase in vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid, with no heterogeneity by site of bleeding (p = 0.5956). Treatment delay did not modify the effect of tranexamic acid on vascular occlusive events.

Interpretation

Death from bleeding occurs soon after onset and even a short delay in treatment reduces the benefit of tranexamic acid administration. Patients must be treated immediately. Further research is needed to deepen our understanding of the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^c7c86d74]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial provides evidence that the administration of tranexamic acid to patients with TBI within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death, with no evidence of adverse effects or complications. We found a substantial reduction in head injury-related deaths with tranexamic acid in patients with mild and moderate head injuries but no apparent reduction in those with severe head injury. We found no increase in disability among survivors.

Our trial had several strengths but also some limitations. The method of randomisation ensured that participating clinicians had no foreknowledge of the treatment allocation and the use of placebo control ensured that outcome assessments were blind to the intervention. Although the eligibility criteria required the recruiting clinician to be uncertain as to the appropriateness of tranexamic acid treatment, because tranexamic acid is not a recommended treatment for patients with isolated TBI, almost all patients with TBI who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Baseline prognostic factors were well balanced and because almost all randomly assigned patients were followed up there was little potential for bias. The analysis was by intention to treat. The primary outcome was head injury-related death as assessed by the responsible clinician. Although some misclassification of cause of death is inevitable, the assessment was made blind to the trial treatment. All-cause mortality combines causes of death that might be affected by tranexamic acid (eg, head injury-related death due to intracranial bleeding) with causes that we do not expect to be affected by tranexamic acid (eg, sepsis) and therefore would be biased towards the null. Although the CRASH-3 trial is one of the largest trials in patients with TBI, the CIs were wide and compatible with a substantial reduction in head injury-related death and little or no benefit. On the other hand, when set in the context of all the available randomised trials of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI (figure 5), the possibility of no mortality benefit appears remote. When assessing outcome measures in clinical trials, provided there are few false positives (high specificity), estimates of the RR are unbiased even when sensitivity is imperfect. For this reason, a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was recorded only if we found a positive result on imaging (eg, ultrasound) or at post-mortem examination. As a result, although the trial might have underestimated the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the RR estimates for this outcome should be unbiased.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^36305a0e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Tranexamic acid (trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid; TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue that is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen. TXA is distributed throughout all tissues, and the plasma half-life is 120 min. The Clinical Randomisation of Antifibrinolytic therapy in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of TXA on death, vascular occlusive events and the receipt of blood product transfusion in trauma patients who were bleeding or at risk of significant bleeding. The trial randomised 20,211 adult trauma patients with or at risk of significant bleeding to either TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo within 8 h of injury. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury. All analyses assessed the intention-to-treat population. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with TXA by 1.5%, and the risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced by 0.8% and a reduction in bleeding deaths by one-third, mainly through preventing exsanguination within the first 24 h. One retrospective study has suggested that TXA is of no benefit in patients with viscoelastic hyperfibrinolysis and another found TXA to reduce multiple organ failure and mortality in severely injured shocked patients. This discrepancy is probably attributable to methodological limitations.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^1517ff1a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Administration of plasma to bleeding patients may stabilise fibrinogen levels, avoiding a further decrease, but plasma transfusions cannot contribute to a significant increase in fibrinogen level unless very high volumes are infused. The Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in Trauma (ACIT) study confirmed these findings, showing that the percentage of coagulopathic patients increased with a standard near 1:1 FFP:RBC transfusion protocol. Similar results were recently reported by Khan et al. Again, a 1:1 FFP:RBC transfusion protocol did not alleviate coagulopathy; the percentage of coagulopathic patients even increased the longer this treatment lasted. Interestingly, in the same study it was shown that only high-dose fibrinogen administration resulted in improved coagulation and a reduction in coagulopathy. Furthermore, both FFP and pathogen-inactivated plasma need to be group-matched, thawed and warmed prior to administration. Therefore, unless pre-thawed plasma is available, plasma transfusion cannot be initiated at the same time as universal RBC transfusion. An average delay of 93 min was reported by Snyder et al. and recently confirmed by Halmin et al. possibly explaining why a real-life targeted plasma:RBC ratio is achieved only a few hours after treatment initiation. During this interval the fibrinogen level is likely to be lower than desired.

Antifibrinolytic agents

Recommendation 25

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant haemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an i.v. infusion of 1 g over 8 h. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 h after injury. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)

### Effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytics in acute severe haemorrhage: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 40 138 bleeding patients [^c317e8cc]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The principal findings of our individual patient-level data meta-analysis are that most deaths from bleeding occur on the day of onset and many occur within the first few hours. Deaths from post-partum haemorrhage peak at 2–3 h after childbirth. Tranexamic acid improves survival but treatment delay reduces the benefit. Every 15 min of treatment delay appears to decrease the benefit by about 10%, with no benefit after 3 h. We found no increase in vascular occlusive events with tranexamic acid.

Our study has various strengths and limitations. First, to reduce selection bias we excluded trials with fewer than 1000 patients. Small trials are underpowered to assess effects on death and there is an increased risk of selective reporting. Second, time of death was only available for post-partum haemorrhage. However, the distribution of deaths by days since bleeding onset was similar in traumatic and post-partum bleeding, and studies show that deaths from traumatic bleeding also peak in the first few hours after injury. Third, we assessed the effect of treatment delay on treatment effectiveness by use of logistic regression models with second-order polynomials to take into account the non-linearity of treatment effect. Because an on–off step function in treatment effectiveness is biologically implausible and highly unlikely, we used treatment delay as a continuous variable. To explore the interaction between treatment effect and time, we used all observations of patients treated within 24 h from bleeding onset and not only within 3 h. Although we found no statistical heterogeneity in the interaction between treatment delay and the effect of tranexamic acid between trials, whether the physiology of bleeding varies by cause is open to question. Treatment delay might be under-estimated in trauma, since many injuries are unwitnessed, and it might have been over-estimated in post-partum haemorrhage because time of birth was taken as the time of onset. Because of these uncertainties, we did sensitivity analyses with a range of plausible errors. Results of these analyses support the conclusion that prompt treatment is essential. Fourth, deaths due to bleeding and deaths from vascular occlusive events could have been misclassified. Some deaths attributed to bleeding might have been due to thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially those occurring several hours after onset. Although results adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure were similar, we cannot exclude the possibility that other unmeasured factors might have influenced the results. The large sample size — more than 40 000 patients with acute severe bleeding — provided a precise assessment of the effect of treatment delay with statistically significant results. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis and missing data were negligible.

### Best timing of tranexamic acid administration for bleeding after trauma or childbirth remains to be established [^ef515e61]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Two RCTs randomising bleeding patients to tranexamic acid or placebo were included: the CRASH2 trial reporting on 20 211 bleeding trauma patients, and the WOMAN trial reporting on 20 060 women with postpartum haemorrhage. Any cause of death (primary outcome in original studies) and death from bleeding (primary outcome in the meta-analysis of the two studies) occurred in 15.2% and 5.3% in the CRASH2 and 2.4% and 1.7% in the WOMAN trial. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one death due to haemorrhage were 125 and 250 for patients with trauma and postpartum haemorrhage, respectively. The main result of the meta-analysis shows that the odds for absence of death from bleeding among patients treated with tranexamic acid compared with placebo was 1.72 (95% CI 1.42 to 2.10) among patients who had received tranexamic acid immediately, and it decreased by 10% for every 15 min of treatment delay.

This result is confounded by cause, severity and course of bleeding and it does not justify the interpretation of the authors. The authors concluded that a short delay in treatment reduces benefit of tranexamic acid administration and that all patients must be treated immediately. Yet, their results did not provide an estimate of the effect of earlier treatment of patients who were actually treated late ('treating all patients immediately').

Patients who were randomised and treated late differ for several reasons from those who were randomised and treated earlier. Reasons for postponing randomisation (and administration of tranexamic acid) may have been: less severe bleeding, the clinical impression that the bleeding is about to stop or that the bleeding will stop due to other interventions. All these factors may influence the efficacy of treatment with tranexamic acid, and, therefore, also the findings. The authors acknowledge this bias and attempted to adjust for it by adding age and blood-pressure-at-inclusion into their regression model. One would need to adjust for many more variables to adequately correct for all the other potentially relevant differences between patients randomised at various times after the start of bleeding or after birth (figure 1).

### Prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients [^75529b19]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the present study of trauma patients, prehospital use of TXA was associated with prolonged time to death and significantly improved early survival, suggesting benefits of TXA on haemostatic resuscitation. Until further evidence emerges, the results support the use of TXA during prehospital treatment of severely injured patients.

### Effect of treatment delay on the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytics in acute severe haemorrhage: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 40 138 bleeding patients [^887de390]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Studies identified in our search are shown in figure 1. We found three completed, and nine ongoing trials,(for three ongoing trials no published data were available [EUCTR2015-002661-36-GB, and]; appendix). All completed trials used tranexamic acid. The CRASH-2 trialassessed the effects of tranexamic acid on death and vascular occlusive events in 20 211 bleeding trauma patients. The WOMAN trialassessed the effects of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in 20 060 women with post-partum haemorrhage. The ATACAS trialassessed the effects of tranexamic acid on death and thrombotic events in 4662 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Because all patients in the ATACAS trial were treated 30 min after induction of anaesthesia, we could not explore the effect of treatment delay in this trial. The included trials had low risk of bias for all domains (appendix).

Figure 1
Study selection

We obtained individual patient-level data for 40 138 participants: 20 127 from the CRASH-2 trial and 20 011 from the WOMAN trial (table 1). The CRASH-2 trial participants were older than WOMAN trial participants. Of the 40 138 participants, 20 094 received tranexamic acid and 20 044 received placebo (table 2). Of the 3558 deaths, 1408 (40%) were due to bleeding, of which 884 (63%) occurred within 12 h of bleeding onset (appendix). In the WOMAN trial, where data on time to death were available, deaths from bleeding peaked at 2–3 h after bleeding onset in untreated women (figure 2). In the WOMAN trial, we excluded 109 (0.5%) patients with a treatment delay of more than 24 h (59 patients in the placebo group and 50 in the tranexamic acid group) on the basis of the WHO definition for primary post-partum haemorrhage. We found no heterogeneity in the treatment effect between trials (model 1: interaction p = 0.7243, appendix). Tranexamic acid significantly increased overall survival from bleeding (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.33; p = 0.001). We found similar results when we excluded from analysis the 2150 deaths from causes other than bleeding (data not shown).

4 Aspects From Part 2 Relevant to Part 1

The following five PICO questions are detailed in part 2, but aspects thereof are relevant to initial management and are duplicated here in the form of a brief summary, with the relevant recommendation: The reader is referred to part 2 for the detailed literature discussion and related references.

15. Anesthesia

Induction and maintenance of anesthesia and airway management carries a risk of cardiovascular collapse, especially in the hypovolemic patient. Fluid resuscitation should commence prior to induction of anesthesia in all hypotensive patients and those normotensive patients deemed to be significantly hypovolemic. Administration of anesthesia should be delayed until the operating theater or other point of hemorrhage control unless the patient's physiology mandates otherwise. Rational choices for administration of anesthesia are ketamine induction and maintenance outside the operating room with consideration of low dose volatile maintenance of anesthesia.

17. Abdominal Closure tray and glove changes

There is high quality evidence to support changing of gloves and using a new set of instruments for definitive sheath closure in abdominal surgery, extrapolation to other surgical procedures can be cautiously advocated.

19a. Resuscitation/use of blood products and coagulation management

Trauma patients should be resuscitated according to a locally relevant massive hemorrhage protocol. This protocol should aim to restore, as near as possible, whole blood to the bleeding patient. As part of these protocols, plasma components should be administered as early as possible. Ideally these should be guided by dynamic coagulation assays such as thromboelstography if available. Crystalloid should be used as a last resort.

The use of tranexamic acid should be considered in different trauma systems depending on pre‐hospital transfer times and access to point of care coagulation tests or dynamic coagulation assays such as thromboelstography if available. Cryoprecipitate is not beneficial given empirically in the early phase, whereas fibrinogen and other factor concentrates may be administered based on tests of coagulation as close to the point of care as possible.

Evidence exists for optimal ventilator management of the trauma patient in the operating room. Best practices do include low to moderate tidal volume (6–8 mL/kg), moderate adjusted PEEP (5–8 cm H₂O), and low driving pressures (< 15 cm H₂O), although up to 10 mL/kg tidal volume may be considered acceptable in the operation room environment.

### Viscoelastic testing guided coagulation management in factor VII deficiency for spinal anaesthesia and caesarean section [^2c645b28]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The risks and benefits of spinal anaesthesia must be assessed in patients with coagulation disorders. A woman in her 20s with congenital factor VII (FVII) deficiency (31%) was admitted at 38 weeks for caesarean delivery. A rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) analysis showed normal coagulation and spinal anaesthesia was performed safely. A repeated ROTEM analysis after haemostasis and uterine closure showed normal coagulation without fibrinolysis. No prophylactic FVII was administered, resulting in a cost savings of US$12884. FVII level did not predict bleeding or fibrinolysis and FVII and tranexamic acid were not indicated.

### Prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients [^7572fbbe]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, the present analysis represents the largest civilian study on prehospital TXA supplementation in trauma patients. The current European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma recommend considering the administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. Since this is based on very limited evidence and extrapolated from the CRASH-2 trial, the authors graded this as a "very weak recommendation" (grade 2C). However, until further evidence emerges from ongoing prospective randomised controlled trials, considering the existing literature on in-hospital administration, the results of the present study support the prehospital use of TXA in those trauma patients with severe injury with confirmed or suspected haemorrhagic shock.

Irrespective of the type of coagulation algorithm used, the early use of tranexamic acid may be recommended to manage the bleeding patient provided there is no contraindication (active DIC or active hypercoagulable state being absolute contraindications) 55. At present, there are close to 200 meta‐analyses that show the success of tranexamic acid in reducing bleeding and the use of allogeneic blood products in surgery and in non‐surgical fields. These meta‐analyses also document the absence of an increased incidence of thromboembolic adverse outcomes following tranexamic acid administration 4.

Some COVID‐19 infected patients need surgery during their ICU stay. In an early phase, most patients are likely to be in a distinct acute phase response with very high levels of platelets, fibrinogen concentration, Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. Later, some may develop DIC. However, the current level of knowledge is very limited and the difference between patients at different stages of the disease is likely to be significant. Therefore, monitoring coagulation with viscoelastic point‐of‐care devices and quick laboratory tests is particularly important in COVID‐19 infected patients. At the present time we propose using the established coagulation algorithms (Fig. 1) including the use of tranexamic acid in COVID‐19 positive patients with less severe disease suffering from trauma.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^7ce9e139]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Quality management

Recommendation 37

We recommend that each institution include an assessment of adherence to the institutional algorithm in routine quality management. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

The development of a multi-disciplinary evidence-based treatment algorithm for the bleeding trauma patient offers a unique opportunity to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. Numerous examples demonstrate the value of a treatment algorithm in improving the care of trauma patients; some also resulted in cost savings. Conversely, deviation from treatment pathways increases morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, with a three-fold increased mortality in the subgroup of major deviations.

The implementation of our recommendations and adherence to a local treatment algorithm is facilitated by a checklist analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Trauma treatment training should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

N/A, not applicable.

In addition, adherence to the institutional treatment algorithm should be included as part of routine institutional quality management. Most institutions have established a quality improvement program to assist clinical teams in evaluating their own performance. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that the following quality standards be used:

â€¢ Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results (full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)).

â€¢ Proportion of patients receiving TXA before leaving the emergency room.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of hemorrhage.

â€¢ Damage control surgical techniques are used in accordance with Recommendation 21.

â€¢ Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 34.

Extended post-discharge follow-up times may be required to provide longer-term outcome data, because an increasing percentage of trauma mortality occurs after hospital discharge. Approximately 50% of mortality among trauma patients older than 65 years of age occurs between 30 days and 6 months after injury.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^4db9677c]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Main results of randomized clinical trials assessing the use of tranexamic acid for acute bleeding.

TXA has also been extensively studied in the setting of traumatic brain injury, a leading cause of trauma deaths often associated with alterations of hemostasis with the features of hyperfibrinolysis. Meta-analysis of two randomized trials examining the effect of TXA on outcomes following traumatic brain injury showed a significant reduction in the progression of intracranial hemorrhage. The results of the CRASH-3 trial were published recently. This trial included 12,737 patients who had isolated acute traumatic brain injury (which occurred within 3 h of random assignment to receive TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes, then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. TXA failed to reduce the primary endpoint, i.e. the risk of head injury-related death. However, after the exclusion of patients too severe to be saved, namely those with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 or unreactive bilateral pupils at baseline, TXA reduced the risk of head injury-related deaths compared to placebo (12.5% vs. 14.0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00). In particular, TXA decreased the risk of injury-related deaths in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64–0.95) but not in those with severe head injury (Table 1). As in CRASH-2, early treatment was more effective than more delayed treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (P = 0.005), with a 10% decrease in treatment effectiveness for every 20 min delay. The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the TXA and placebo groups. Notably, the CRASH-3 trial was the first RCT to show that a drug has neuroprotective properties for patients with traumatic brain injury and even reduced mortality. Finally, a very recently published meta-analysis of six RCT on the effect of TXA, compared with placebo, on traumatic brain injury showed that this medication was associated with a reduced mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85–0.97; P = 0.0004).

### The importance of early treatment with tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-2 randomised controlled trial [^8115da73]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aim of the CRASH-2 trial was to assess the effects of early administration of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced all-cause mortality. Because tranexamic acid is thought to exert its effect through inhibition of fibrinolysis, we undertook exploratory analyses of its effect on death due to bleeding.

Methods

The CRASH-2 trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20,211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned by selection of the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. We examined the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding according to time to treatment, severity of haemorrhage as assessed by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score (GCS), and type of injury. All analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial Register/Department of Health DOH-27-0607-1919.

Findings

10,096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10,115 to placebo, of whom 10,060 and 10,067, respectively, were analysed. 1063 deaths (35%) were due to bleeding. We recorded strong evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied according to the time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p < 0.0001). Early treatment (≤ 1 h from injury) significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (198/3747 [5.3%] events in tranexamic acid group vs 286/3704 [7.7%] in placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57–0.82; p < 0.0001). Treatment given between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (147/3037 [4.8%] vs 184/2996 [6.1%]; RR 0.79, 0.64–0.97; p = 0.03). Treatment given after 3 h seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleeding (144/3272 [4.4%] vs 103/3362 [3.1%]; RR 1.44, 1.12–1.84; p = 0.004). We recorded no evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score, or type of injury.

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid should be given as early as possible to bleeding trauma patients. For trauma patients admitted late after injury, tranexamic acid is less effective and could be harmful.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^f48f309f]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Evidence to support the effectiveness of patient management algorithms in changing clinical care is weak, however local implementation of a multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment algorithm or clinical management guideline for the bleeding trauma patient is likely to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The local treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. However, any guideline is designed for the "average" patient, therefore the clinician must adapt and tailor treatment to best accommodate each individual case.

If key interventions described in a guideline are implemented, outcomes are likely to be improved and death and other complications reduced. Moreover, treatment according to management guidelines may be associated with cost savings. Unfortunately, strict guideline adherence is often challenging in a complex case with poor prognosis, therefore the association between guideline adherence and good outcomes is not necessarily causal.

The implementation of our recommendations might be facilitated by a checklist approach analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative, which led to fewer postoperative complications. In addition or alternatively, it may be possible to implement our recommendations using bundles as has been successfully achieved during implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Suggested patient management bundles are listed in Table 5.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

Table 5
Suggested management bundles

Training in trauma care should emphasise the key role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increasing clinician knowledge and understanding in this area should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should evaluate their own performance using a routine institutional quality management programme. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that adherence to the following quality standards be assessed:
Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.
Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results [full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)].
Proportion of patients receiving TXA within 3 h after injury.
Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of haemorrhage.
Damage control surgical techniques used in accordance with Recommendation 19.
Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 37.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^988a4f3d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-hospital TXA guidance

TXA was added to the military Joint Trauma System Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline (approved 10/2011) which currently recommends "The early use of TXA (ie, as soon as possible after injury but ideally not later than 3 hours postinjury) should be strongly considered for any patient requiring blood products in the treatment of combat-related hemorrhage and is most strongly advocated in patients judged likely to require massive transfusion (eg, significant injury and risk factors for massive transfusion)".

The European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma (box 1) recommend early TXA administration in bleeding trauma patients, and "suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)". A review of TXA as part of damage control resuscitation in the prehospital setting concluded that "High-level evidence supports its use in trauma and strongly suggests that its implementation in the prehospital setting offers a survival advantage to many patients, particularly when evacuation to surgical care may be delayed".

Box 1
Prehospital TXA recommendations from European guidelines (from Rossaint et al)

Antifibrinolytic agents (Recommendation 25)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 hours after injury. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)

International Trauma Life Support (ITLS) recommends the following: "ITLS believes that there is sufficient evidence to support the use of TXA in the management of traumatic hemorrhage, pursuant to system medical control approval. Following initial resuscitation including control of external bleeding and stabilization of airway, consideration should be given to administration of TXA during early stages of transport. TXA should be considered in those patients who show signs of hemorrhagic shock, including tachycardia (> 110 bpm) and hypotension (SBP < 100) and are less than 3 hours from injury".

### Effect of early tranexamic acid administration on mortality, hysterectomy, and other morbidities in women with post-partum haemorrhage (WOMAN): an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^5d10ac19]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The dilution of the effect of tranexamic acid arising from interventions that were initiated prior to receipt of the trial treatment is likely to apply to other surgical interventions and blood transfusion. Considering that there may only be a few hours from onset of primary post-partum haemorrhage to maternal death, it is not surprising that other interventions were given concurrently with the trial treatment. Given the urgency, clinicians cannot wait and see if the trial treatment has an effect before giving other treatments, not least because half of the women received placebo. The only outcome that invariably follows randomisation is death. This may explain why in this trial, and in the CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in significant traumatic bleeding, there was a reduction in death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid despite no reduction in transfusion.

The WOMAN trial began before the results of the CRASH-2 trial of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients were available. The CRASH-2 trial recruited 20 211 adults with traumatic bleeding and showed that tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding and all-cause mortality with no increase in vascular occlusive events. There was strong evidence of a time to treatment interaction. In patients treated within 3 h of injury, tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding by around one third, but when given after 3 h, it seemed to increase the risk. Early activation of fibrinolysis is common after trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Because similar temporal changes in fibrinolysis have been observed after childbirth, we expected that early treatment with tranexamic acid would also be more effective after post-partum haemorrhage and planned to set the WOMAN trial results in the context of all available clinical data on the time to treatment interaction. Bearing in mind that even a large trial such as ours would have limited power to detect a time to treatment interaction for death due to bleeding, setting the trial results in the context of the totality of the available evidence seemed to be the most sensible approach. Although there are on-going trials of tranexamic acid in life threatening bleeding, the CRASH-2 trial is the only trial to date that provides such evidence. Figure 5 shows the results of the WOMAN trial in the context of the CRASH-2 results. There is a strong suggestion that early treatment is most effective and late treatment is unlikely to be beneficial.

### The impact of prehospital tranexamic acid on blood coagulation in trauma patients [^5926c2a7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited data on prehospital administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in civilian trauma. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in coagulation after severe trauma from on-scene to the hospital after TXA application in comparison to a previous study without TXA.

Methods

The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02354885). A prospective, multicenter, observational study investigating coagulation status in 70 trauma patients receiving TXA (1 g intravenously) on-scene versus a control group of 38 patients previously published without TXA. To account for potential differences in patient and trauma epidemiology, crystalloid and colloidal resuscitation fluid, 2 propensity score matched groups (n = 24 per group) were created. Measurements included ROTEM, standard coagulation tests and blood gas analyses on-scene and emergency department admission. Presented values are mean and [standard deviation], and difference in means and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Patient epidemiology was not different between groups. Coagulation assays on-scene were comparable between the TXA and C. Prehospital hyperfibrinolysis was blunted in all 4 patients in the TXA group. Viscoelastic FIBTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), representing functional fibrinogen levels, did not change from on-scene to the emergency department in the TXA group, whereas MCF decreased -3.7 [1.8] mm in the control group. Decrease of MCF was significantly reduced in the TXA group in EXTEM by 9.2 (7.2–11.2) mm (P < .001) and INTEM by 6.8 (4.7–9.0) mm (P < .001) in favor of the TXA group. Production of fibrinogen fragments (represented by D-dimers) was significantly lower in the TXA group compared to group C.

Conclusions

Early prehospital administration of TXA leads to clot stabilization and a reduction of fibrinolytic activity, causing a decrease in fibrin degradation products buildup (D-dimer).

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^79280ee5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

A recent 'Guidance Document for the Prehospital Use of Tranexamic Acid in Injured Patients' also made broad recommendations (box 2) endorsed by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the National Association of EMS Physicians". Given the lack of data available, our organizations recommend that prehospital TXA administration be monitored closely in a prehospital and/or trauma registry. Administration should be reviewed and protocols constantly refined to avoid unnecessary or incomplete doses, inappropriate patient selection, or lack of infusion following the initial bolus. TXA dosing, timing, blood transfusion requirements, and any adverse events should be included in the registry". Unfortunately, at present, there are no robust civilian data to guide which patients would potentially benefit from TXA administration in the prehospital setting.

Box 2
Prehospital TXA recommendations from US guidelines (from Fischer et al)

TXA administration to bleeding patients

Objective measurements should be used to guide prehospital TXA administration protocols. The focus for management of compressible, external bleeding should be on direct pressure, tourniquets, hemostatic agents, and/or wound packing. Evidence of injury consistent with non-compressible hemorrhage (eg, penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma or unstable pelvis fractures) along with heart rate > 120 bpm and SBP < 90 mm Hg are suggested criteria. Agencies may consider vital sign adjustments for the geriatric population.

Don't forget the basics

In the bleeding patient, hemorrhage control and appropriate resuscitation remain the priority. Prehospital TXA use should never supersede field bleeding control techniques, rapid transport to a trauma center, or the administration of blood or plasma.

Ongoing pre-hospital TXA clinical trials

Two ongoing clinical trials are examining the efficacy of TXA in the prehospital setting for patients with severe injury and hemorrhage using exception from informed consent for emergency research.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^bdd8838a]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding and decreases mortality in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can cause brain herniation and death. We aimed to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI.

Methods

This randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 175 hospitals in 29 countries. Adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or lower or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to patients within 3 h of injury. This change was made blind to the trial data, in response to external evidence suggesting that delayed treatment is unlikely to be effective. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury. We prespecified a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 and those with bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN15088122), EudraCT (2011-003669-14), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR20121000441277).

Results

Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12 737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50.3%] or placebo [6331 [49.7%], of whom 9202 (72.2%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury. Among patients treated within 3 h of injury, the risk of head injury-related death was 18.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19.8% in the placebo group (855 vs 892 events; risk ratio [RR] 0.94 [95% CI 0.86–1.02]). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the risk of head injury-related death was 12.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14.0% in the placebo group (485 vs 525 events; RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–1.00]). The risk of head injury-related death reduced with tranexamic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0.78 [95% CI 0.64–0.95]) but not in patients with severe head injury (0.99 [95% CI 0.91–1.07]; p value for heterogeneity 0.030). Early treatment was more effective than was later treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (p = 0.005) but time to treatment had no obvious effect in patients with severe head injury (p = 0.73). The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups (RR 0.98 (0.74–1.28). The risk of seizures was also similar between groups (1.09 [95% CI 0.90–1.33]).

Interpretation

Our results show that tranexamic acid is safe in patients with TBI and that treatment within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after injury.

Results

Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50.3%] or placebo [6331 [49.7%], of whom 9202 (72.2%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury.

The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups (RR 0.98 (0.74–1.28). The risk of seizures was also similar between groups (1.09 [95% CI 0.90–1.33]).

Interpretation

Our results show that tranexamic acid is safe in patients with TBI and that treatment within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after injury.

### BET 1: intravenous tranexamic acid for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage [^de6c6a56]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to see if administering tranexamic acid reduced mortality in patients with postpartum haemorrhage. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. Two randomised controlled trials were found, a smaller one suggesting that treatment with tranexamic acid reduced the volume of blood lost and a much larger study that showed a reduction in mortality due to bleeding in this patient group. There were no significant side effects from this treatment found in either study.

### Tranexamic acid in pediatric trauma: why not? [^d10271ac]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Use of tranexamic acid in pediatric hemorrhagic trauma

According to best available evidence in 2014, TXA significantly decreases mortality in bleeding trauma patients 16 years of age and older without significantly increasing prothrombotic complications if administered within 3 hours of injury. Currently, there is no evidence of benefit in patients with TBI, and results from CRASH-3 should guide treatment in this area. Early treatment with TXA is recommended in adult trauma patients at risk for significant hemorrhage, patients being transfused, and particularly those requiring massive transfusion or who have an elevated baseline risk of death.

While the evidence specifically for TXA in pediatric trauma is not yet available, we feel that TXA should be considered for use in adolescent trauma patients in the same dosing regimen and indications as used in adults. Given the consistency in coagulation response to tissue injury across age spectrums, we feel that young children with hemodynamic instability and ongoing risk for hemorrhage would also benefit from TXA while recognizing this specifically as an area in need of further research. The adoption and use of this inexpensive and cost-effective therapy may reach only a small percentage of pediatric trauma patients. However, without anticipated risk, in children requiring transfusion support following trauma, TXA plausibly holds similar or greater benefit for mortality reduction than has already been demonstrated in adults. Denying injured children TXA due to the lack of pediatric trauma trial evidence in this indication is likely shortsighted and unnecessary given the ample clinical evidence in other pediatric settings, the excellent safety record of the drug, and the clear mortality benefit seen in adult trauma.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^bb2477de]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Each year, worldwide, there are more than 60 million new cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Road traffic crashes and falls are the main causes and the incidence is increasing. Intracranial bleeding is a common complication of TBI and increases the risk of death and disability. Although bleeding can start from the moment of impact, it often continues for several hours after injury. Ongoing intracranial bleeding can lead to raised intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and death. Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin blood clots (fibrinolysis). The CRASH-2 trial, showed that in patients with trauma with major extracranial bleeding, early administration (within 3 h of injury) of tranexamic acid reduces bleeding deaths by a third. Subsequent analyses showed that even a short delay in treatment reduces the benefit of tranexamic acid administration. On the basis of these results, tranexamic acid was included in guidelines for the pre-hospital care of patients with trauma, although patients with isolated TBI were specifically excluded. However, increased fibrinolysis, as indicated by increased concentrations of fibrinogen degradation products, is often seen in patients with TBI and predicts intracranial haemorrhage expansion. Therefore, early administration of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI might prevent or reduce intracranial haemorrhage expansion and thus avert brain herniation and death.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Evidence from the CRASH-2 trial that administration of tranexamic acid within 3 h of injury reduces death in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding raised the possibility that tranexamic acid might reduce death from traumatic intracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and increases head injury-related death and disability. Before the CRASH-3 trial, we made a systematic search for all randomised trials of tranexamic acid in acute traumatic injury. We searched PubMed, Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Zetoc, SIGLE, Global Health, LILACS, Current Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for all publications until July 15, 2010. Details of our search were published previously. We found two small randomised trials of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury with a total of 510 patients. Meta-analysis of the two trials showed a statistically significant reduction in death with tranexamic acid. However, given the small size of the trials, we considered this evidence to be hypothesis generating, requiring confirmation in larger randomised trials.

FLO-ELA protocol v2. 0 29 April 2020 8 4 INTRODUCTION Emergency abdominal surgery on the gastrointestinal tract is a common major surgical procedure performed for life-threatening abdominal conditions related to underlying cancer, infection or previous surgery. It is performed on over 30, 000 patients in England and Wales each year and has. a particularly high burden of postoperative morbidity and mortality, with a 90-day postoperative mortality rate of 20% in those aged 50 and over.

The critical need to improve the care of patients undergoing this procedure has been recognized by the establishment of a national audit of care and outcomes in this patient group and a number of national quality. It is accepted that intra-venous fluids given during and after surgery have an important effect on patient outcomes, in particular following major gastrointestinal surgery. Yet they are commonly prescribed to subjective criteria leading to wide variation in clinical practice. One possible solution is the use of cardiac output monitoring to guide intra-venous fluid dosing as part of a haemodynamic therapy. algorithm. This approach has been studied for many years and has been shown to modify inflammatory pathways, and improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation. A Cochrane review of this intervention was recently updated, incorporating the largest contemporary trial in this area to date.

Complications were less frequent among patients treated according to a hemodynamic therapy algorithm and a reduced duration of hospital stay. There was a non-significant reduction in mortality at longest follow-up. Despite this suggestion of benefit in elective surgery, these findings are not generalisable to patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Patients requiring emergency bowel surgery have fundamental pathophysiological differences from elective patients. These include acute inflammation, sepsis, bleeding, and fluid disturbances which may be established before surgery even begins. They. therefore have similarities with critically ill patients, in whom the evidence base for fluid resuscitation based on cardiac output monitoring is very uncertain.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: a joint position statement and resource document of NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT [^da4188ed]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In a pharmacokinetic assessment of trauma patients who received prehospital TXA, Grassin-Delyle et al.observed that 21% of patients receiving a 1-g bolus followed by 1-g infusion over 8 hours did not reach serum TXA concentrations sufficient to inhibit fibrinolysis. Unfortunately, no correlation between serum concentration and patient outcomes has been established. We believe this is a needed focus in future research.

There is currently insufficient evidence to establish one optimal TXA dosing strategy. Either 1-g bolus and 1-g infusion over 8 hours or 2-g bolus can be specified by protocol for civilian prehospital systems based upon local preferences established between EMS physicians, emergency physicians, and trauma surgeons.

Identification of Patient Populations That May Benefit From Prehospital Administration of Tranexamic Acid for Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock

Prehospital TXA administration, if used for adult trauma patients, should be given to those with clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock and no later than 3 hours post-injury. There is no evidence to date to suggest improved clinical outcomes from TXA initiation beyond this time or in those without clinically significant bleeding.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before the WOMAN trial, there was evidence that antifibrinolytics reduced surgical blood loss and re-operation to control bleeding. To assess the effects of anti-fibrinolytics in post-partum haemorrhage, we did a systematic review of randomised trials published in any language. We searched the following databases up to November, 2008: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, Web of Science, metaRegister of controlled trials, LILACS, Reproductive Health Library, African Health-line, POPLINE, MedCarib, CINAHL, and the reference lists of eligible trials. Search terms have been published previously (Ferrer P, 2009). We found no trials of antifibrinolytics in post-partum haemorrhage. In 2010, while the WOMAN trial was underway, findings of an international multicentre randomised trial of 20 211 bleeding trauma patients (the CRASH-2 trial) showed that tranexamic acid reduced death due to bleeding with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive events. Subgroup analyses showed that tranexamic acid was only effective when given within 3 h of injury. In 2012, WHO guidelines recommended that tranexamic acid should be used for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage when uterotonics fail to control the bleeding or when the bleeding is thought to be due to trauma. The evidence for this recommendation was extrapolated from trials in surgery and trauma showing that tranexamic acid was a safe option for the treatment of trauma-related bleeding.

Many trauma systems are examining whether to implement prehospital tranexamic acid (TXA) protocols since hemorrhage remains the leading cause of potentially preventable early trauma mortality, and early in-hospital administration of TXA within 3hours of injury is associated with reduced mortality. But robust evidence regarding the efficacy of prehospital administration of the antifibrinolytic drug TXA on trauma outcomes is lacking. This review examines the current evidence available regarding prehospital TXA efficacy in both military and civilian trauma, and updates available evidence regarding in-hospital TXA efficacy in trauma.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^9b4ea328]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

If TXA is restricted to massive transfusion protocols or only used in patients clinically judged to be at "high risk", it is estimated that only 40% of the potential population who would benefit from this treatment will be treated. For all potential patients to receive TXA, TXA should therefore be administered to all patients with trauma and significant bleeding. Thus, TXA should be included as part of each institutional "trauma management protocol" not the "massive blood loss" or "major haemorrhage" protocols. The benefit of on-scene TXA administration has recently been shown to be independent of the severity of injury.

Secondly, Moore et al. suggested that TXA be administered only in those patients with hyperfibrinolysis determined using TEG®, as many patients who have traumatic injuries lack a hyperfibrinolytic trace, a so-called "hypofibrinolytic shutdown". However, Raza et al. have clearly shown that TEG® is poor at detecting fibrinolytic activation when compared with more sensitive assays. Furthermore, support for the unreliability of ROTEM® in detecting hyperfibrinolysis comes from Gall et al. who showed that S100A10, an endothelial receptor for plasminogen, leaches off the endothelium during trauma and interferes with detection of fibrinolysis using ROTEM®. We therefore recommend that TXA be administered as soon as possible, without waiting for viscoelastic results.

### Tranexamic acid timing and mortality impact after trauma [^f39f1798]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Trauma resuscitation guidelines across the world have incorporated the administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) within 3 hours of injury. The 3-hour window was deduced from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH-2) trial and has not been replicated. The aim of this study was to determine whether death within 28 days after trauma varied according to time from injury to the first TXA dose and, if so, precisely determine the therapeutic window.

Methods

This was an exploratory analysis of the Prehospital Tranexamic Acid for Severe Trauma (PATCH-Trauma) trial, which enrolled adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either TXA (administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1 g before hospital admission, followed by a 1 g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) or matched placebo. In this analysis, we examined the effect of time from injury to first treatment dose on death within 28 days utilizing a continuous scale with linear, first-degree fractional polynomial, and second-degree fractional polynomial functions of time from injury to first treatment dose. Further log-binomial regression analyses were performed in subgroups based on the information obtained from the previous step.

Results

The intention-to-treat study cohort comprised 1,287 patients, of which 635 had been allocated to the placebo arm and 652 to the TXA arm. The median time from injury to first treatment dose was 79 (interquartile range [IQR] 55 to 112) minutes. Risk of death within 28 days increased as the time to first dose of treatment increased, with benefit most pronounced up to 90 minutes. Beyond 90 minutes, the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) crossed the line of equivalence (risk ratio, 1). Administration of TXA within 90 minutes significantly reduced the risk of death within 28 days (67/393 [17%] in the TXA group versus 91/363 [25%] in placebo group; adjusted risk ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82), whereas administration beyond 90 minutes did not decrease mortality at 28 days (adjusted risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.47).

Conclusion

The optimal therapeutic window for TXA after trauma may be within 90 minutes.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^533a3a88]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Abortion-related hemorrhage — secondary treatment and antifibrinolytic use — When bleeding is excessive or refractory to massage and uterotonics, the clinician should move quickly to secondary treatment measures, and the following measures should be instituted without delay: placement of additional intravenous lines, fluid resuscitation, and laboratory assessment (including hemoglobin, coagulation parameters, and cross-match). In suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), administration of fibrinogen concentrate is an acceptable first step even without laboratory evidence, and transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate can also be initiated without laboratory evidence of DIC. Tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis and stabilizes blood clots; while the guideline does not find sufficient evidence to recommend for or against TXA in abortion hemorrhage, given postpartum data, we suggest it as a safe and effective agent for prophylaxis and treatment for hemorrhage at the time of abortion (GRADE 2C). TXA is commonly administered intravenously as 1000 mg either 30 minutes before the procedure, and it can also be administered intramuscularly.

Patient Selection Criteria

Patient selection protocols that identify candidates for prehospital TXA administration should utilize clinical determinants easily and readily available to EMS clinicians. Simultaneously, such protocols should not distract from or hinder timeliness of richer evidence-based patient care priorities. There is agreement in research and current practice that prehospital TXA administration should not be indiscriminately given to all trauma patients, instead being reserved for those in hemorrhagic shock. Most civilian prehospital TXA protocols identify candidate patients based on the CRASH-2 criteria of systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg and/or a heart rate of > 110 beats per minute who are < 3 hours from the time of injury.

Unfortunately, definitive, objective prehospital markers of patients who are in hemorrhagic shock, and therefore might benefit most from TXA, have not yet been well defined. Table 1 outlines the available prognostic tools derived from outcomes based on in-hospital TXA administration. There is limited certainty in extrapolating these to prehospital use. The recent multicenter, randomized controlled PATCH Trial utilized the Coagulopathy of Severe Trauma score and time less than 3 hours from injury as their initial patient inclusion criteria. The Coagulopathy of Severe Trauma score was developed in the hospital as a prognostic tool, and its use to identify prehospital patients with risk of coagulopathy has not been validated. Tools or criteria to identify prehospital patients who would most benefit from TXA administration is a significant area for further research.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^1560d40a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

TXA use (administered to patients receiving at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells) was associated with improved survival (OR 7.3; 95% CI 3.02 to 17.32) in battle casualties in the military setting from a Role 3 Echelon combat surgical hospital in southern Afghanistan (retrospective observational studies, Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation, MATTERs).

What civilian trauma data are available regarding TXA impact on trauma outcomes? Three civilian single-center studies from large urban trauma centers examined the impact of implementation of a protocol for in-hospital TXA administration on trauma outcomes.

A single-center study (Ryder Trauma Center, Miami, Florida) examined patients who were under emergency surgical intervention directly from ED resuscitation area or required blood transfusions (n = 1217, 8/2009–1/2013). TXA was initiated on 3/2011 at surgeon discretion. TXA patients (n = 150) were matched to controls with propensity scores using the variables of age, sex, traumatic brain injury (TBI), mechanism of injury, SBP, blood transfusion and injury severity score (ISS). For the highest injury acuity patients, TXA was associated with increased mortality (27% vs 17%, p = 0.024). The authors stated that, in most patients, TXA was administered after the patient had already received transfusion of blood products. The lack of benefit of TXA may be related to the rapid availability of blood product resuscitation in mature trauma centers such as this.

A single-center study (University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston) reported their implementation of a protocol to administer TXA in trauma patients with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis (defined as LY-30 of 3% or greater by rapid thromboelastography) on admission in 2011. Trauma registry data for all adult patients from 9/2009 to 9/2013 with evidence of hyperfibrinolysis (n = 1032) were examined. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in the TXA group (40% vs 17%, p < 0.001). Using logistic regression analysis (controlling for age, sex, ISS, arrival physiology and base deficit) TXA did not reduce in-hospital mortality (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.40; p = 0.80) in patients with documentation of viscoelastic hyperfibrinolysis.

### Prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients [^5d256ca8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

However, although the amount of blood components was lower in the TXA group, the difference was not significant. Surprisingly, only about 25% in both groups required any transfusion at all. The lower mortality rates may also be explained by the anti-inflammatory effects of TXA, although further studies are required to elucidate this potential additional benefit. Multiple randomised controlled trials from elective surgery (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiovascular) have shown beneficial effects of TXA with respect to reduced perioperative blood loss. Still, to date, CRASH-2 represents the only randomised controlled trial on TXA in trauma. The researchers in that study recruited 20,211 trauma patients following hospital admission and showed that treatment with TXA significantly reduced all-cause mortality vs. placebo (14.5% vs. 16.0%). Death caused by haemorrhage was reduced as well (4.9% vs. 5.7%), without increasing thromboembolic events. The authors of a post hoc analysis observed beneficial effects, especially when TXA was given early (within 1 h after trauma), and delayed administration was even linked with worse outcomes. However, several weaknesses and gaps of CRASH-2 have been discussed controversially. First, data on laboratory values, on injury severity or on subtypes of transfused blood components (pRBC, fresh frozen plasma) were not reported. Second, the majority of patients were enrolled in low-income or developing countries, causing hesitancy to translate the findings to mature trauma systems. Retrospective military studies (Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation [MATTERs]) from a combat treatment facility in southern Afghanistan confirmed the benefits of TXA in battle casualties. The evidence from developed countries remains equivocal. In a single-centre retrospective analysis done in Miami, FL, USA, TXA was administered at a median of 97 minutes following ER admission to 150 patients deemed to be at high risk for haemorrhagic death. Propensity score-based matching demonstrated higher mortality in the TXA group. In another single-centre study, done in London, UK, the majority of patients (n = 160) received TXA in the ER during the adoption phase of a major haemorrhage protocol. However, this cohort was also more severely injured and more coagulopathic than non-TXA patients, since TXA was administered when critical injury or signs of haemorrhagic shock were present. Still, multivariate adjustments suggested potential benefits in severely injured shock patients. Furthermore, Moore et al. demonstrated that only a minority of severely injured patients presented with hyperfibrinolysis upon admission and a majority even displayed shut-down of fibrinolysis, raising concerns that TXA might cause complications in these patients. Although CRASH-2 showed no difference with respect to vascular occlusive events, the authors admitted that, owing to trial design, they "might have underreported the frequency of these events". In the MATTERs study, TXA was associated with higher rates of thromboembolic events. In our study, we found no difference, but data were incomplete. However, longer ICU stay and longer hospital stay in our TXA group might indicate a more complicated course.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^de068949]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid in acute bleeding conditions

In addition to the preventive use of TXA, a number of studies have investigated the role of this anti-fibrinolytic agent in patients presenting with acute, critical bleeding.– In trauma patients, the largest body of evidence stems from the Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH) trials. In the CRASH-2 trial, 20,211 severely injured adults with confirmed or suspected hemorrhage were randomly assigned within 8 h from the occurrence of trauma to receive TXA (loading bolus dose of 1 g and then an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Despite no difference in bleeding rate and transfusion use, all-cause mortality was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (14.5% vs. 16%, respectively; RR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, P = 0.0035). Similarly, the rate of deaths attributed to bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (P = 0.0077) (Table 1). Yet, from a sub-analysis of CRASH-2, the timing of TXA administration was crucial for patients' outcomes. Early infusion of TXA within 1 h after trauma was associated with the largest survival benefit (absolute reduction = 2.4%, number needed to treat = 41). TXA infused between 1 and 3 h also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (absolute reduction = 1.3%, number needed to treat = 77), but a later administration (> 3 h after trauma) was associated with an increased risk of death from bleeding compared with the risk among patients receiving placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12–1.84; P = 0.004). There was no evidence that TXA increased the risk of vascular occlusive events and, in a pre-specified analysis of the data collected when TXA was given within 3 h of injury, there was even a reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal vascular occlusive events (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53–0.89; P = 0.005). Following the publication of this study, the World Health Organization (WHO) included TXA in their list of essential medicines (available at:). Since this seminal study, a number of randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of anti-fibrinolytic agents have been published. The Cochrane systematic review regarding anti-fibrinolytic drugs for acute traumatic injury found that, after the analysis of four trials involving 20,548 patients, TXA reduced the risk of death by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85–0.96; P = 0.002) without increasing the risk of adverse events.

There has been an increased interest in the use of viscoelastic testing to guide blood product replacement during the acute resuscitation of the injured patient. Currently, no uniformly accepted guidelines exist for how this technology should be integrated into clinical care. In September 2014, an international multidisciplinary group of leaders in the field of trauma coagulopathy and resuscitation was assembled for a 2-day consensus conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This panel included trauma surgeons, hematologists, blood bank specialists, anesthesiologists, and the lay public. Nine questions regarding the impact of viscoelastic testing in the early resuscitation of trauma patients were developed before the conference by panel consensus. Early use was defined as baseline viscoelastic test result thresholds obtained within the first minutes of hospital arrival-when conventional laboratory results are not available. The available data for each question were then reviewed in person using standardized presentations by the expert panel. A consensus summary document was then developed and reviewed by the panel in an open forum. Finally, a two-round Delphi poll was administered to the panel of experts regarding viscoelastic thresholds for triggering the initiation of specific treatments including fibrinogen, platelets, plasma, and prothrombin complex concentrates. This report summarizes the findings and recommendations of this consensus conference.

### Understanding the neuroprotective effect of tranexamic acid: an exploratory analysis of the CRASH-3 randomised trial [^4dde98f3]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tranexamic acid safely reduces early deaths in non-moribund TBI patients regardless of TBI severity or country income. The effect of tranexamic acid in patients with isolated TBI is similar to that in polytrauma, reducing deaths on the day of the injury by over 20% in the CRASH-2 and the CRASH-3 trials. Tranexamic acid is included in treatment guidelines for the pre-hospital care of bleeding trauma patients, but patients with isolated TBI were excluded. The CRASH-3 trial data support the reconsideration of tranexamic acid for administration in isolated TBI, and even severely injured patients appear to benefit when treated soon after injury.

Treatment of excessive bleeding — laboratory-guided component therapy and adjuncts — includes that in patients with excessive bleeding, the following recommendations are made based upon the evidence for each of these interventions when studied singly or when compared with placebo. Obtain a platelet count before transfusion of platelets, if possible, and in addition obtain a test of platelet function, if available, in patients with suspected or drug-induced (e.g., clopidogrel) platelet dysfunction. Obtain coagulation tests (i.e. PT or INR and aPTT) before transfusion of FFP, if possible, and assess fibrinogen levels before the administration of cryoprecipitate, if possible. Desmopressin may be used in patients with excessive bleeding and platelet dysfunction. Consider topical hemostatics such as fibrin glue or thrombin gel, and consider the use of antifibrinolytics (i.e., ɛ-aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid) if fibrinolysis is documented or suspected and if these agents are not already being used.

### Effect of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury: a nested randomised, placebo controlled trial (CRASH-2 intracranial bleeding study) [^d0f404cc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications of results

The CRASH-2 trial has shown reliably that early administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding reduces the risk of all cause mortality. As a consequence of this trial, tranexamic acid has been incorporated into trauma treatment protocols worldwide. Many patients with traumatic haemorrhage also have traumatic brain injury, and concerns about the risk of cerebral ischaemia may affect decisions whether to give tranexamic acid to these patients. The results presented here are the only available evidence to inform doctors about the effect of tranexamic acid on brain ischaemic lesions in patients with traumatic haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, and, although imprecise, the results should give some reassurance about the safety of tranexamic acid in such patients.

Our results also have important research implications. In theory, if tranexamic acid reduces intracranial haemorrhage after traumatic brain injury without increasing the risk of ischaemic lesions, it could substantially improve patient outcomes. Until now, however, no trial has evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury. Our results suggest it is probable that, in such patients, the benefits of tranexamic acid administration would outweigh the risks. If such an inexpensive and widely practicable treatment were found to improve patient outcomes after traumatic intracranial haemorrhage this would have major implications for clinical care. The CRASH-3 trial will determine reliably the effectiveness of the early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid in patients with traumatic brain injury.

### Trauma-induced coagulopathy: what you need to know [^1ae861fe]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a global inflammatory state accompanied by coagulation derangements, acidemia, and hypothermia, which occurs after traumatic injury. It occurs in approximately 25% of severely injured patients, and its incidence is directly related to injury severity. The mechanism of TIC is multifaceted; proposed contributing factors include dysregulation of activated protein C, increased tPA, systemic endothelial activation, decreased fibrinogen, clotting factor consumption, and platelet dysfunction. Effects of TIC include systemic inflammation, coagulation derangements, acidemia, and hypothermia. Trauma-induced coagulopathy may be diagnosed by conventional coagulation tests including platelet count, Clauss assay, international normalized ratio, thrombin time, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time; viscoelastic hemostatic assays such as thrombelastography and rotational thrombelastography; or a clinical scoring system known as the Trauma Induced Coagulopathy Clinical Score. Preventing TIC begins in the prehospital phase with early hemorrhage control, blood product resuscitation, and tranexamic acid therapy. Early administration of prothrombin complex concentrate is also being studied in the prehospital environment. The mainstays of TIC treatment include hemorrhage control, blood and component transfusions, and correction of abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, acidosis, and hypothermia.

### Simplified treatment algorithm for the management of trauma-induced hemorrhage without viscoelastic testing [^f9a7f219]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled bleeding after major trauma remains a significant cause of death, with up to a third of trauma patients presenting with signs of coagulopathy at hospital admission. Rapid correction of coagulopathy is therefore vital to improve mortality rates and patient outcomes in this population. Early and repeated monitoring of coagulation parameters followed by clear protocols to correct hemostasis is the recommended standard of care for bleeding trauma patients. However, although a number of treatment algorithms are available, these are frequently complex and can rely on the use of viscoelastic testing, which is not available in all treatment centers. We therefore set out to develop a concise and pragmatic algorithm to guide treatment of bleeding trauma patients without the use of point-of-care viscoelastic testing. The algorithm we present here is based on published guidelines and research, includes recommendations regarding treatment and dosing, and is simple and clear enough for even an inexperienced physician to follow. In this way, we have demonstrated that treatment protocols can be developed and adapted to the resources available, to offer clear and relevant guidance to the entire trauma team.

### Tranexamic acid combined with recombinant factor VIII increases clot resistance to accelerated fibrinolysis in severe hemophilia a… [^906ec425]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with severe hemophilia A suffer from a profoundly compromised hemostatic response. In addition to both the delayed and slow development of a clot, previous studies have documented that severe hemophilia A is also associated with reduced clot stability.

Objectives

We examined whether the clot stability in hemophiliacs could be improved by treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) in combination with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII).

Patients/Methods

Baseline blood samples were obtained from eight males with severe hemophilia A. Thereafter, a bolus injection of rFVIII was administered to increase the functional level of FVIII to approximately 50%. After 10 min, blood was collected followed by an intravenous injection of TXA. A third blood sample was obtained after a further 10 min. Whole blood clotting profiles were determined by thrombelastography using minimal tissue factor activation. Clot formation was assessed by both clot initiation and clot propagation. At clot termination, the maximum clot firmness and area under the elasticity curve were used to illustrate clot stability. Tissue-plasminogen activator was included in those experiments designed to assess clot stability.

Results

As expected, rFVIII increased clot formation, whereas TXA had no effect upon this parameter. Assays including tissue-plasminogen activator revealed that rFVIII increased the maximum clot firmness 3-fold; whereas the presence of TXA induced an additional 4-fold increase. The area under the elasticity curve increased 5-fold after rFVIII and 24-fold after addition of TXA.

Conclusions

The study demonstrates that simultaneous treatment with TXA and rFVIII significantly improves the clot stability in patients with hemophilia A.

### Prehospital administration of tranexamic acid in trauma patients [^e60bbd9a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Exsanguination remains the leading cause of early mortality in trauma patients and recent research has elucidated the role of acute trauma-associated coagulopathy in aggravating haemorrhage. Resuscitation strategies for severely injured patients with massive blood loss include several key components, such as transfusion of blood components to reestablish perfusion and coagulation function. Furthermore, several commercially available haemostatic agents are commonly applied as adjuncts to support coagulation. Since clot degradation by early hyperfibrinolysis has been reported to play a major role in traumatic coagulopathy and massive bleeding, recent clinical research has been focused on the antifibrinolytic substance tranexamic acid (TXA). However, only one large randomised controlled trial — Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage 2 (CRASH-2) — has examined the effect of in-hospital TXA administration in trauma, but the results have been discussed controversially due to several weaknesses of the trial, such as that the majority of patients were enrolled in developing countries. Altogether, evidence on prehospital TXA use in trauma, especially from European countries, is scarce. Accordingly, existing guidelines either provide no statement or make only a weak recommendation to consider en route administration of TXA. However, since no other drug is approved for coagulation support during prehospital treatment, the aim of the present study was to assess whether prehospital intravenous (i.v.) administration of TXA in trauma patients is associated with improved outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically with respect to coagulation and viscoelastic testing, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that viscoelastic tests, particularly thromboelastography, may reduce mortality and reduce transfusion exposure.

Background

The use of tranexamic acid in trauma patients at risk for hemorrhage remains controversial. This guideline evaluates the use of tranexamic acid in two clinical settings, the prehospital environment and the inpatient setting. In addition, this PMG evaluates the use TXA in specific populations and at different dosages and evaluates the potential risks associated with its use.

Methods

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, an EAST working group conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE CENTRAL. Articles in English from 2000 through 2023 were considered in evaluating four PICO questions relevant to the use of TXA in injured trauma patients at risk of hemorrhage (defined as patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mm Hg or a heart rate ≥ 110/min or suspicion for active hemorrhage).

Results

Thirty studies were identified for qualitative analysis, of which 24 met criteria for meta-analysis. TXA was associated with a significant reduction in 24-hour mortality in both prehospital (log risk ratio, -0.29; 95% confidence interval, -0.53 to -0.05; p = 0.02) and in-hospital settings (-0.38[-0.69, -0.06]; p = 0.02). A similar benefit was observed at 30-days across both settings (prehospital: -0.18[-0.35, -0.00]; p = 0.05, in-hospital: -0.24[-0.40, -0.07]; p = 0.01). In patients with SBP ≤ 75 mm Hg, TXA reduced mortality, but this was not found to be significant (-0.18 [-0.46, 0.09]; p = 0.20). The incidence of vaso-occlusive events did not differ between groups in either setting. Moreover, a large heterogeneity regarding TXA dosing regimens and comparison groups across studies was observed.

Conclusion

Based on current available evidence, we conditionally recommend for the routine use of TXA in the prehospital and in-hospital settings. We cannot recommend for or against the use of an initial higher dose of bolus TXA. Finally, we conditionally recommend for the routine use of TXA in patients with severe hypotension.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid for severe trauma [^914d00f3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether prehospital administration of tranexamic acid increases the likelihood of survival with a favorable functional outcome among patients with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy who are being treated in advanced trauma systems is uncertain.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults with major trauma who were at risk for trauma-induced coagulopathy to receive tranexamic acid (administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 1 g before hospital admission, followed by a 1-g infusion over a period of 8 hours after arrival at the hospital) or matched placebo. The primary outcome was survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury, as assessed with the use of the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Levels on the GOS-E range from 1 (death) to 8 ("upper good recovery" [no injury-related problems]). We defined survival with a favorable functional outcome as a GOS-E level of 5 ("lower moderate disability") or higher. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause within 28 days and within 6 months after injury.

Results

A total of 1310 patients were recruited by 15 emergency medical services in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Of these patients, 661 were assigned to receive tranexamic acid, and 646 were assigned to receive placebo; the trial-group assignment was unknown for 3 patients. Survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months occurred in 307 of 572 patients (53.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 299 of 559 (53.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 1.12; P = 0.95). At 28 days after injury, 113 of 653 patients (17.3%) in the tranexamic acid group and 139 of 637 (21.8%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99). By 6 months, 123 of 648 patients (19.0%) in the tranexamic acid group and 144 of 629 (22.9%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.03). The number of serious adverse events, including vascular occlusive events, did not differ meaningfully between the groups.

Conclusions

Among adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy who were being treated in advanced trauma systems, prehospital administration of tranexamic acid followed by an infusion over 8 hours did not result in a greater number of patients surviving with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months than placebo.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^a3874689]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many trauma centers are examining the potential use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the prehospital phase of care in an attempt to provide an adjunct to early hemorrhage control to improve trauma outcomes. But the published evidence on prehospital TXA use in trauma is small. This review, therefore, first updates the current evidence regarding in-hospital TXA efficacy and examines the evidence for efficacy of prehospital use of TXA in trauma. These data are needed to determine whether to implement prehospital TXA protocols or not, and to determine which trauma patients may benefit from prehospital TXA administration for prehospital protocol development.

Evidence for in-hospital TXA

At present, there is still only one large randomized clinical trial (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage 2 (CRASH-2)) that examined the efficacy of in-hospital TXA in trauma and documented that all-cause mortality was reduced from 16.0% to 14.5% (1.5% absolute reduction, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.91 (0.85 to 0.97), p = 0.0035, NNT 67) and risk of death caused by bleeding was reduced from 5.7% to 4.9% (0.8% reduction, NNT 121). Importantly, for bleeding deaths, early TXA treatment was better: TXA given ≤ 1 hour after injury was more protective than when given 1–3 hours after injury, and TXA given after 3 hours was associated with increased risk of death (figure 1).

We have previously reviewed the significant limitations of the CRASH-2 trial and the difficulty in translating the international study results to large civilian trauma centers and trauma systems of care. We also reviewed that in the CRASH 2 subgroup analysis, the most significant mortality benefit for TXA was in the severe shock cohort, trauma patients with admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 75 mm Hg with 28-day all-cause mortality of 30.6% for TXA vs 35.1% for placebo (RR 0.87, 99% CI 0.76 to 0.99).

Deaths and vascular occlusive events by treatment allocation

The appendix shows the treatment benefits stratified by 60-min intervals of delay. With the exception of the first hour, effectiveness decreased with increasing treatment delay. Among patients who died from bleeding (appendix), we found that those who received treatment within the first hour were more often women and were younger with a higher proportion of penetrating injuries (for trauma patients). We found no heterogeneity in the interaction between treatment delay and the effect of tranexamic acid between trials (model 2: p = 0.1363 for the triple interaction between the trial, tranexamic acid, and treatment delay with linear terms and p = 0.3891 for the triple interaction between the trial, tranexamic acid, and treatment delay with squared terms). In model 3, treatment delay appeared to reduce the treatment benefit (p < 0.0001 for the trend of increasing benefit with earlier treatment, figure 3) after adjustment for age and systolic blood pressure. When given immediately, tranexamic acid significantly improved survival (OR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.42–2.10; p < 0.0001) but the benefit decreased with increasing delay in a non-linear association (p = 0.0109 for the interaction between treatment group and treatment delay squared). We estimated the time at which the lower bound of the 95% CI crossed the null value to be 135 min, with no apparent treatment benefit observed at 180 min. From model 3, we estimated that the treatment benefit decreased by 10% for every 15 min of treatment delay (figure 4). We found the same results after exclusion of deaths from other causes (data not shown).

### Do all trauma patients benefit from tranexamic acid? [^d1695f63]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study tested the hypothesis that early routine use of tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces mortality in a subset of the most critically injured trauma intensive care unit patients.

Methods

Consecutive trauma patients (n = 1,217) who required emergency surgery (OR) and/or transfusions from August 2009 to January 2013 were reviewed. At surgeon discretion, TXA was administered at a median of 97 minutes (1-g bolus then 1-g over 8 hours) to 150 patients deemed high risk for hemorrhagic death. With the use of propensity scores based on age, sex, traumatic brain injury (TBI), mechanism of injury, systolic blood pressure, transfusion requirements, and Injury Severity Score (ISS), these patients were matched to 150 non-TXA patients.

Results

The study population was 43 years old, 86% male, 54% penetrating mechanism of injury, 25% TBI, 28 ISS, with 22% mortality. OR was required in 78% at 86 minutes, transfusion was required in 97% at 36 minutes, and 75% received both. For TXA versus no TXA, more packed red blood cells and total fluid were required, and mortality was 27% versus 17% (all p < 0.05). The effects of TXA were similar in those with or without TBI, although ISS, fluid, and mortality were all higher in the TBI group. Mortality associated with TXA was influenced by the timing of administration (p < 0.05), but any benefit was eliminated in those who required more than 2,000-mL packed red blood cells, who presented with systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg or who required OR (all p < 0.05).

Conclusion

For the highest injury acuity patients, TXA was associated with increased, rather than reduced, mortality, no matter what time it was administered. This lack of benefit can probably be attributed to the rapid availability of fluids and emergency OR at this trauma center. Prospective studies are needed to further identify conditions that may override the benefits from TXA.

There are methodological issues with all of the techniques applied to measure fibrinogen concentration. The Clauss method is the gold standard laboratory assay; however, in the presence of artificial colloids such as HES this method may overestimate the actual fibrinogen concentration. Functional fibrinogen measurement using TEM is also influenced by Hct and FXIII levels.

Three questions remain unanswered with respect to the use of supplementary fibrinogen. First, it is not clear whether use, especially early use, of fibrinogen reduces mortality. An early observational study suggested that fibrinogen substitution can improve survival in combat-related trauma. In the civilian setting, the use of TEM-guided fibrinogen replacement reduced exposure to allogeneic blood products. Retrospective reviews of single-centre experiences in the management of massive blood loss in trauma patients have also suggested a reduced mortality when compared with expected mortality and increased 30-day survival. Data from an open-label single-centre RCT that investigated the use of factor concentrates versus FFP suggested that early use of fibrinogen was more effective than early use of FFP, as fewer patients required rescue therapy.

In contrast, a retrospective analysis of those who received cryoprecipitate versus those who did not showed no improved outcome, although cryoprecipitate was only administered to patients with fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L and this group showed no improved clinical outcome. The retrospective Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation (MATTERs II) study of massive military bleeding suggested that cryoprecipitate may independently add to the survival benefit of TXA in the seriously injured patient who requires transfusion. However, cryoprecipitate is often administered with great delay. In the PROMMTT study, the median time from admission to the first cryoprecipitate unit was 2.8 h (IQR 1.7–4.5), and in the Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in Trauma (ACIT) study, cryoprecipitate was administered only after the first six units of blood.

### Efficacy of high dose tranexamic acid (TXA) for hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f425a632]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard dose (≤ 1 g) tranexamic acid (TXA) has established mortality benefit in trauma patients. The role of high dose IV TXA (≥ 2 g or ≥ 30 mg/kg as a single bolus) has been evaluated in the surgical setting, however, it has not been studied in trauma. We reviewed the available evidence of high dose IV TXA in any setting with the goal of informing its use in the adult trauma population.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and unpublished sources from inception until July 27, 2022 for studies that compared standard dose with high dose IV TXA in adults (≥ 16 years of age) with hemorrhage. Screening and data abstraction was done independently and in duplicate. We pooled trial data using a random effects model and considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies separately. We assessed the individual study risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Results

We included 20 studies with a combined total of 12,523 patients. Based on pooled RCT data, and as compared to standard dose TXA, high dose IV TXA probably decreases transfusion requirements (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.97, moderate certainty) but with possibly no effect on blood loss (mean difference [MD] 43.31 mL less, 95% CI 135.53 to 48.90 mL less, low certainty), and an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.04, very low certainty) and mortality (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.32, very low certainty).

Conclusion

When compared to standard dose, high dose IV TXA probably reduces transfusion requirements with an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events and mortality.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^a4409a5c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Implementation issues

All studies used similar dosing to CRASH-2, with 1 g IV TXA loading dose followed by an infusion of 1 g IV maintenance infusion over a longer period of time. Some patients with TBI have other associated traumatic injuries; this recommendation supports the use of TXA in trauma with or without TBI, while the severity and nature of injuries is being assessed. As in the general trauma population, there is a suggestion that if TXA is given, it is most likely to be effective when given early, within 3 h although the prehospital may not be more effective. While some centers may use viscoelastic testing to guide interventions, early empiric use of TXA may still be beneficial, as point of care results may not be sensitive for hyperfibrinolysis.

Evidence summary

A number of trials have evaluated anti-fibrinolytic therapies in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 10 of which evaluated IV TXA. These studies demonstrated no change in mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88–1.16; RD − 0.3%, 95% CI − 3.2 to 4.2%, moderate certainty) or poor functional outcome (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95–1.15; RD − 0.4%, 95% CI − 1.9 to 5.8, low certainty), but a reduced risk of rebleeding (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.44–0.8; RD − 7.8%, 95% CI − 11 to − 3.9, moderate certainty), offset by an increased risk of stroke (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67; RD 6.1%, 0.2% to 14.1%, low certainty). Only the recent ULTRA trial reported rates of venous thrombosis, which were rare but similar between groups. Most trials were several decades old, with only the three most recent trials evaluated TXA within clinical context with the use of calcium channel blockers and endovascular coiling of aneurysms, though results appear generally consistent between older and newer trials.

### Practice bulletin no. 183: postpartum hemorrhage [^f6d95d19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tranexamic acid — efficacy, timing, safety, and use in postpartum hemorrhage are detailed. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that can be given intravenously or orally, and the WOMAN trial compared 1 g of intravenous tranexamic acid to placebo. Although the composite endpoint was not reduced, death from obstetric hemorrhage was lower with tranexamic acid (1.5% versus 1.9%, P = 0.045), and when given within 3 hours of birth mortality from obstetric hemorrhage was 1.2% versus 1.7% (P = 0.008). The risk of thrombosis appears not different from controls in surgeries and was not higher in WOMAN trial recipients. At this time, data are insufficient to recommend prophylactic use outside research, but tranexamic acid should be considered for obstetric hemorrhage when initial medical therapy fails; earlier use is likely superior, with benefit primarily in women treated sooner than 3 hours. For clinicians unfamiliar with tranexamic acid, consultation with a local or regional expert and incorporation into management guidelines is advised.

Introduction

It is estimated that 69 million traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur each year worldwide, resulting mainly from road traffic crashes and falls. The incidence of TBI is increasing, and this trend is expected to continue as the global population ages, and as motor vehicle use increases. While the incidence of TBI is highest among high-income countries, the burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which accounts for almost three-quarters of all TBIs.TBI can result in long-term disability or death, and can have a substantial impact on the individual's family due to loss of income and informal caregiving. It also impacts on the economy due to healthcare expenditure and productivity loss. Around 8% of all TBIs are classified as severe (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3–8), which are more likely to result in death or long-lasting disability, compared with mild (GCS of 13–15) or moderate (GCS 9–12) head injury, for which the risk of death is lower, but still considerable.

Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots. Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in reducing deaths from traumatic and postpartum haemorrhage. More recently, the multinational CRASH-3 trial assessed the impact of tranexamic acid on head injury deaths when administered within 3 hours of TBI, and showed a reduction in head injury deaths for those sustaining a mild or moderate head injury. However, its cost-effectiveness for this indication is yet to be assessed.

Since healthcare resources are constrained, it is important to ensure that any policy decision to fund tranexamic acid treatment in this indication results in overall net health gains. This will only occur if tranexamic acid provision replaces a less cost-effective alternative that is currently provided. For this reason, as prespecified in the trial protocol, we present an economic evaluation of tranexamic acid following TBI using the results from the CRASH-3 trial, combined with a decision modelling approach to estimate the long-term costs and benefits of treatment.

### The use of viscoelastic haemostatic assays in the management of major bleeding: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^b687bebb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to coagulation and viscoelastic testing, BSH 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that viscoelastic tests, particularly thromboelastography, may reduce mortality and reduce transfusion exposure. Consider using viscoelastic tests, if available, for transfusion guidance in trauma hemorrhage.

### Mechanism of action of tranexamic acid in bleeding trauma patients: an exploratory analysis of data from the CRASH-2 trial [^44cb55ce]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

To investigate the mechanism of action of tranexamic acid (TXA) in bleeding trauma patients, we examined the timing of its effect on mortality. We hypothesised that if TXA reduces mortality by decreasing blood loss, its effect should be greatest on the day of the injury when bleeding is most profuse. However, if TXA reduces mortality via an anti-inflammatory mechanism its effect should be greater over the subsequent days.

Methods

Exploratory analysis, including per-protocol analyses, of data from the CRASH-2 trial, a randomised placebo controlled trial of the effect of TXA on mortality in 20,211 trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding. We examined hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause mortality, deaths due to bleeding and non-bleeding deaths, according to the day since injury. The CRASH-2 trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258.

Results

The effect of TXA on mortality is greatest for deaths occurring on the day of the injury (HR all-cause mortality = 0.83, 0.73 to 0.93). This survival benefit is only evident in patients in whom treatment is initiated within 3 hours of their injury (HR ≤ 3 hours = 0.78, 0.68 to 0.90; HR > 3 hours = 1.02, 0.76 to 1.36). Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 hours of injury reduced the hazard of death due to bleeding on the day of the injury by 28% (HR = 0.72, 0.60 to 0.86). TXA treatment initiated beyond 3 hours of injury appeared to increase the hazard of death due to bleeding, although the estimates were imprecise.

Conclusions

Early administration of tranexamic acid appears to reduce mortality primarily by preventing exsanguination on the day of the injury.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and infarction in patients with traumatic brain injury: a pre-planned substudy in a sample of CRASH-3 trial patients [^ca3778c4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The background, protocoland results, of the CRASH-3 trial have been reported previously. Adults with head injury who were within 3 hours of injury, and had a baseline Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of ≤ 12 or any intracranial bleeding on CT, and no significant extracranial bleeding were eligible for randomisation in hospital. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 hours, but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to within 3 hours of injury. Patients with TBI were randomly allocated to receive TXA (loading dose 1 g over 10 min, then 1 g infusion over 8 hours) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride), as an additional treatment to the standard management of TBI.

Patients, care givers and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation.

Between July 2012 and January 2019, a total of 12 737 patients were randomised into the CRASH-3 trial in 175 hospitals across 29 countries, of whom 9202 patients were randomised within 3 hours of injury. This exploratory substudy (NCT01402882) was developed during the course of the CRASH-3 trial and the protocol and analysis plan were registered and published before the CRASH-3 trial was unblinded.

Patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the CRASH-3 trial were eligible for this substudy (figure 1). While this substudy was underway, we restricted its eligibility to patients with GCS ≤ 12 since many patients with mild TBI did not have a post-randomisation scan. In addition, patients needed to have had at least one CT scan within 28 days of randomisation, and be randomised before or during the time that the single assessor of the scans was on site.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^c35aca4d]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although TXA has been known for more than 50 years, its successful use never ceases to amaze us. The incredible current interest in this old drug is demonstrated by the increasing number of PubMed citations (589 in 2019) and by the high number of trials listed at(432 at the time of writing). The current evidence in the literature documents the efficacy and safety of TXA in preventing bleeding in a variety of at-risk conditions and thanks to this effect TXA is nowadays an essential drug in the therapeutic armamentarium of PBM-based protocols developed by the majority of hospitals worldwide with the aim of minimizing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood.

The most recently published data show unequivocally that TXA also plays a prominent role in the management of critical bleeding. Indeed, considering the results of the CRASH-2, CRASH-3 and WOMAN trials (remarkably, CRASH-2 and CRASH-3 trials were truly independent research, not funded by pharmaceutical companies), more than 50,000 bleeding patients have been investigated so far for the hemostatic effect of TXA. Although with different designs, the results of these trials are very similar and clear: TXA is effective in reducing the risk of death due to bleeding regardless of the cause. Furthermore, all these three trials identified early administration of the drug as a crucial issue for improving patients' outcome.

Additional striking evidence of the beneficial effect of TXA in acute trauma patients comes from the increasing use of this agent in the military setting. Indeed, the positive results of the CRASH-2 trial, conducted in civilian trauma populations, triggered a series of studies evaluating TXA in combat trauma patients. The largest trial was the retrospective observational Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation study (MATTERs), which evaluated TXA in subjects with combat-related injury and found that the addition of this anti-fibrinolytic agent to blood component-based resuscitation resulted in a survival improvement, particularly in patients requiring massive transfusion. Thus, on the basis of the findings from the previously mentioned trials, early administration (within 3 h of injury) of TXA is now globally incorporated as an essential therapeutic strategy in the majority of resuscitation protocols, not only in civilian but also in military trauma centers.

### Effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^ba293814]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid can reduce bleeding in patients undergoing elective surgery. We assessed the effects of early administration of a short course of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma patients.

Methods

This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20 211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated with a computer random number generator. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury, and other. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered as ISRCTN86750102, Clinicaltrials.govNCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial RegisterDOH-27-0607-1919.

Findings

10 096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10 115 to placebo, of whom 10 060 and 10 067, respectively, were analysed. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced with tranexamic acid (1463 [14.5%] tranexamic acid group vs 1613 [16.0%] placebo group; relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.97; p = 0.0035). The risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced (489 [4.9%] vs 574 [5.7%]; relative risk 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.96; p = 0.0077).

Interpretation

Tranexamic acid safely reduced the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients in this study. On the basis of these results, tranexamic acid should be considered for use in bleeding trauma patients.

Regarding medical management for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to tranexamic acid, ACEP/ACS/NAEMSP 2025 guidelines recommend to administer tranexamic acid in the prehospital setting for adult trauma patients with clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock no later than 3 hours post-injury. Insufficient evidence to suggest improved clinical outcomes from tranexamic acid initiation beyond this time or in patients without clinically significant bleeding.
