## Question

Eculizumab for aplastic anemia from drugs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether eculizumab is an appropriate therapy for drug‑induced aplastic anemia, and if so, in what circumstances it should be used and why or why not it would help the pathophysiology of AA specifically, with safety and guidelines in mind. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathobiology of drug‑induced aplastic anemia and its standard first‑line treatments. Then, I should verify eculizumab's mechanism and labeled/established indications to see if they align with AA. Next, I will examine guideline statements and evidence addressing AA with or without PNH clones, and consider overlap scenarios like complement‑mediated TMA. Finally, I should weigh safety considerations and synthesize a practical, guideline‑concordant approach, cross‑checking against BSH AA guidance and complement‑inhibition data in PNH/aHUS to ensure alignment with current standards.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework: drug‑induced aplastic anemia is an acquired bone‑marrow failure syndrome characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and a hypocellular marrow, most often driven by immune‑mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells rather than complement‑mediated hemolysis, so the primary problem is failure of production, not intravascular hemolysis; I should double‑check that this aligns with contemporary guideline definitions, which emphasize diagnostic reassessment to exclude mimics and clonal evolution that would alter management [^113chNMq] [^114cdZw8].

> Next, I should review standard of care for severe or very severe acquired AA, including the drug‑induced subset; wait, let me verify dosing nuances and adjuncts before concluding anything about eculizumab. The BSH 2024 guidelines endorse withdrawal of the culprit drug and first‑line immunosuppression with equine antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporin, with eltrombopag commonly added, along with supportive care and consideration of transplantation pathways when appropriate, which directly target the immune‑mediated marrow failure rather than complement activation [^113tvzia] [^113u4rvC] [^114ggjbW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about eculizumab just because it improves anemia in other settings; I need to check its mechanism and approved uses. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody to C5 that blocks terminal complement and is effective in diseases marked by uncontrolled complement‑mediated intravascular hemolysis or endothelial injury, such as PNH and aHUS, with robust data from TRIUMPH and subsequent studies showing reductions in hemolysis and transfusion needs in PNH; that profile fits hemolytic disease biology, not aplastic marrow failure, so a direct role in uncomplicated AA is biologically implausible despite its impact on anemia in PNH, and that's the critical distinction I need to keep front‑of‑mind [^115tkWNh] [^115VLpMV] [^113chNMq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could guidelines still suggest any role in AA itself; I should confirm. The BSH guidance and expert reviews note that many AA patients harbor small PNH clones, usually without hemolysis, and emphasize that patients with ongoing marrow failure from moderate or severe AA are unlikely to benefit from eculizumab; therapy should address the marrow failure, not terminal complement, so in pure AA without hemolysis, eculizumab is not recommended and would be off‑label without evidence of benefit [^116ZSEQm] [^113otLo8] [^115VRCME].

> But wait, what if there is an AA/PNH overlap; let me consider that scenario carefully. If a patient with drug‑induced AA has a large PNH clone with clinical intravascular hemolysis or thrombosis, then complement‑mediated hemolysis becomes a treatable disease component, and eculizumab is appropriate for the PNH phenotype while the marrow failure still requires AA‑directed immunosuppression; screening for a PNH clone at baseline and again at six months is guideline‑endorsed to identify such overlap and to time intervention appropriately [^116ZSEQm] [^113otLo8] [^115tkWNh].

> I should also double‑check a different but related pitfall: some drugs cause complement‑mediated thrombotic microangiopathy rather than AA per se. In drug‑induced TMA, particularly gemcitabine‑associated or other secondary aHUS‑like syndromes, eculizumab has been used to halt complement‑driven endothelial injury and hemolysis, often with renal recovery; short courses may suffice in secondary forms, which is distinct from treating aplastic marrow failure and should not be conflated with AA management [^112ts53b] [^117AXE9x].

> I need to ensure I weigh risks properly, especially in immunocompromised AA patients; hold on, I should verify the infectious risk profile. Terminal complement blockade carries a meaningful risk of invasive Neisseria infections, mandating meningococcal vaccination and often antibiotic prophylaxis, with labeling and contemporary reviews citing approximately a 0.5% annual risk; this risk–benefit calculus reinforces avoiding eculizumab in AA unless there is clear, complement‑mediated pathology to treat, such as hemolytic PNH overlap or complement‑mediated TMA [^115VRCME] [^112BxAV3] [^113chNMq].

> Let me now synthesize a practical approach and double‑check it aligns with the evidence base. In a patient with presumed drug‑induced AA, I would stop the offending agent, confirm severity and etiology, initiate ATG plus cyclosporin with eltrombopag as indicated, and provide supportive care; I would screen for a PNH clone at baseline and again at six months, adding eculizumab only if there is a clinically significant hemolytic PNH phenotype or if a complement‑mediated TMA is diagnosed, while otherwise avoiding complement blockade when neither hemolysis nor TMA is present [^113tvzia] [^116ZSEQm] [^112ts53b].

> Bottom line, and I should be explicit here to avoid misinterpretation: eculizumab is not an appropriate therapy for uncomplicated drug‑induced aplastic anemia because the core problem is immune‑mediated marrow failure rather than complement‑driven hemolysis; its role is limited to two exceptions, namely AA with clinically significant hemolytic PNH overlap and drug‑induced complement‑mediated TMA, in which case it targets the complement pathology while AA‑directed management proceeds in parallel [^113u4rvC] [^115VRCME] [^112ts53b].

Eculizumab is **not indicated for aplastic anemia (AA)** and should not be used to treat AA [^113u4rvC]. It is a complement C5 inhibitor approved for PNH and aHUS [^113chNMq] and is **appropriate only for AA patients with clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis** [^115VRCME]. Eculizumab **does not address immune-mediated marrow failure** in AA; standard therapy remains immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine, with or without eltrombopag, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^113tvzia]. Use of eculizumab in AA without PNH is **unsupported** and may expose patients to unnecessary risks and costs [^113chNMq] [^1155kTH7].

---

## Mechanism of action of eculizumab

Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that **binds complement component C5**, preventing its cleavage into C5a and C5b and thereby blocking formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) [^115tkWNh]. This inhibits terminal complement–mediated intravascular hemolysis, the core pathology in PNH and aHUS [^113chNMq].

---

## Pathophysiology of aplastic anemia

AA is characterized by **immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells**, leading to pancytopenia and marrow hypocellularity [^113u4rvC]. The primary mechanism is autoreactive T-cell–mediated stem cell injury, not complement-mediated hemolysis.

---

## Clinical evidence for eculizumab in aplastic anemia

There is **no clinical evidence supporting eculizumab for AA without PNH** [^113u4rvC]. Its role in AA is limited to patients who develop clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis, where it targets complement-mediated hemolysis rather than marrow failure [^113otLo8].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend eculizumab for AA without PNH** [^113u4rvC]. Standard first-line therapy is immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine, with or without eltrombopag, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^113tvzia]. Eculizumab is considered only when AA coexists with clinically significant PNH clones causing hemolysis or thrombosis [^113otLo8] [^115VRCME].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Eculizumab effectively reduces hemolysis, stabilizes hemoglobin, and lowers thrombosis risk in PNH [^115tkWNh], but **does not improve marrow failure in AA** [^113u4rvC]. Its safety profile includes an increased risk of meningococcal infection, headache, and infusion reactions [^113chNMq]; meningococcal vaccination is required before use [^115VRCME].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness in AA** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Eculizumab | Complement C5 inhibition | - PNH <br/> - aHUS | Not effective in AA without PNH [^113tvzia] |
| ATG + cyclosporine | Immunosuppression | AA | Effective first-line therapy [^113u4rvC] |
| Eltrombopag | Thrombopoietin receptor agonist | AA | Effective adjunctive therapy [^113tvzia] |
| Allogeneic stem cell transplantation | Replacement of hematopoietic stem cells | AA | Curative in eligible patients [^114ggjbW] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Cost**: Eculizumab is expensive and not justified in AA without PNH [^1155kTH7].
- **Safety**: Increased risk of serious infections, including meningococcal disease [^113chNMq].
- **Lack of evidence**: No data support its use in AA without PNH [^113u4rvC].

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

There are **no significant ongoing trials evaluating eculizumab in AA without PNH**; current research focuses on immunosuppressive strategies, stem cell transplantation, and novel agents targeting immune-mediated marrow failure [^113tvzia].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Eculizumab is **not indicated for AA without PNH** [^113u4rvC]. It does not address immune-mediated marrow failure in AA and **should be considered only** when clinically significant PNH clones with hemolysis or thrombosis are present [^113otLo8]. Standard AA therapy remains immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporine, with or without eltrombopag, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^113tvzia].

### How we'll treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^115VRCME]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Therapeutic complement inhibition by eculizumab has revolutionized the treatment of these patients and is now considered the standard of care for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) patients with haemolytic disease or thromboembolic complications. Eculizumab provides symptomatic relief, with PNH-related symptoms resurfacing upon withdrawal. Haemolysis-related transfusions, clinical signs arising from intravascular haemolysis, and thrombosis occurrence are all valid reasons to begin therapy, whereas clone size per se is not. Conversely, patients with ongoing bone marrow failure from moderate or severe aplastic anaemia are less likely to derive any benefit from eculizumab. For these patients, therapy should address the underlying bone marrow failure.

All patients receiving eculizumab should be vaccinated since the most severe risks of terminal complement blockade are life-threatening neisserial infections. In some countries, such as France and the UK, penicillin prophylaxis is usually recommended, but this has not yet been formally evaluated. Despite the breakthrough nature of eculizumab in PNH treatment, recent efforts have been made to further improve its standard therapy. This manuscript reviews the issues in anti-complement treatment for PNH and sets the goals for future complement inhibitors in development for PNH.

### A systematic review of the role of eculizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy [^111YPTic]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Eculizumab is a recombinant fully humanized IgG2/IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to C5, thereby preventing the formation of the terminal complement complex. It is currently used successfully in the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The use of eculizumab is being explored for treating other types of glomerulonephritis where complement dysregulation is implicated, including IgA nephropathy and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Given its mode of action, eculizumab has also been considered for use in lupus nephritis (LN).

The aim of this project was to determine the role of eculizumab as adjunctive therapy in patients with LN. The objectives were to perform a systematic literature review using the PICOS framework:

- **Participants**: All ages, sexes, and ethnicities included.
- **Intervention**: Those who received complement inhibition therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
- **Comparison**: Before and after complement inhibition therapy.
- **Outcome**: Any measurable outcome.
- **Study design**: Any study design.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anemia, specifically concerning initial assessment, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a careful reassessment to confirm the precise diagnosis and exclude clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, as this will influence the choice of conditioning. It is crucial not to overlook constitutional AA to avoid serious and potentially lethal toxicity from the transplant and inappropriate selection of a family donor.

### Proposal for individualized dosing of eculizumab in atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome: Patient friendly and cost-effective [^114qqQpK]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

As therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of eculizumab is not yet implemented in every clinic, we aimed to develop a 4-week dosing interval of eculizumab without the necessity of measuring drug concentrations. With our 4-week dosing interval, 91% of all patients reach the efficacy target during the complete dosing interval.

As lifelong eculizumab administration does not seem a prerequisite for effective treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), one may consider a one-time higher dose to allow effective treatment during a holiday. The cost increments due to longer dosing intervals are limited. Furthermore, one saves outpatient treatment costs when administering eculizumab every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks.

With the recent introduction of the long-acting C5-inhibitor, ravulizumab-cwvz, the development of a 4-week interval regimen of eculizumab has probably become less relevant. However, we think that eculizumab might still be the drug of choice in several subgroups of aHUS, such as patients who need short-term treatment.

Different analytical methods to measure eculizumab concentrations and classical pathway activity were used in this study for logistical reasons. Although one may argue that using different bioanalytical assays, which may result in slightly different results for eculizumab concentrations, is a shortcoming of our study, our systematic analysis and cross-validation of the bioanalytical methods allowed us to correct for this phenomenon and to perform an integral analysis of all pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data in this rare disease.

Nonetheless, our findings stress the necessity of cross-validation of laboratory methods.

### Eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, improves anaemia in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1134Yt8U]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). High credibility.

In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), chronic destruction of PNH red blood cells (RBCs) by complement leads to anaemia and other serious morbidities. Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement-mediated PNH RBC destruction by targeting C5. In the phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled TRIUMPH study, eculizumab reduced haemolysis, stabilized haemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements, and improved fatigue in patients with PNH.

Herein, we explored the effects of eculizumab on measures of anaemia in patients from the TRIUMPH study and the open-label SHEPHERD study, a more heterogeneous population. Eculizumab reduced haemolysis regardless of pretreatment transfusion requirements and regardless of whether or not patients became transfusion-dependent during treatment (P < 0.001). The reduction in haemolysis was associated with increased PNH RBC counts (P < 0.001) while reticulocyte counts remained elevated.

Eculizumab-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of haemoglobin as compared with placebo in TRIUMPH and relative to baseline levels in SHEPHERD (P < 0.001 for each study). Eculizumab lowered transfusion requirement across multiple pretreatment transfusion strata and eliminated transfusion support in the majority of both TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD patients (P < 0.001). Patients who required some transfusion support during treatment with eculizumab showed a reduction in haemolysis and transfusion requirements and an improvement in fatigue. Eculizumab reduces haemolysis and improves anaemia and fatigue, regardless of transfusion requirements.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^116ZSEQm]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2024 guidelines recommend specific protocols concerning diagnostic investigations for aplastic anemia, particularly in screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. It is advised to obtain screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria at the initial diagnosis of aplastic anemia. If the initial test is negative, a follow-up test should be conducted after six months, with subsequent annual testing unless symptoms or signs develop. For cases where the screening is positive, or becomes positive, testing should be repeated every three months during the first year. The frequency of testing can be reduced only if the proportion of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells remains stable.

### Ultomiris [^1161e32c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The study in eculizumab-experienced and complement-inhibitor naïve pediatric patients with PNH, ALXN1210-PNH-304 (NCT03406507), was a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study. It included pediatric patients with PNH who were either experienced with eculizumab or were treatment-naïve to complement inhibitors.

A total of 13 pediatric patients completed the intravenously administered Ultomiris treatment during the Primary Evaluation Period, which lasted 26 weeks. Among these, five patients had never been treated with complement inhibitors, while eight had received eculizumab. Of the thirteen patients, eleven were between 12 and 17 years old at the time of the first infusion, and two were under 12 years old (11 and 9 years old).

Based on body weight, patients received a loading dose of Ultomiris on Day 1, followed by maintenance treatment on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q8w) for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for those weighing < 20 kg. For patients who entered the study already on eculizumab therapy, Day 1 of the study treatment was planned to occur 2 weeks after the patient's last dose of eculizumab.

### Advancements in complement inhibition for PNH and primary complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy [^113chNMq]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, was the first approved complement-directed therapy for patients with PNH and aHUS and has been associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Eculizumab is administered intravenously, with a loading dose of 600 mg weekly for four doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 900 mg every two weeks. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 protein, blocking its activation and preventing the formation of the terminal attack complex. Although eculizumab is well tolerated, it carries a 0.5% annual risk of contracting Neisseria meningitidis infection. Leading studies, including the TRIUMPH (N = 87) and SHEPHERD (N = 97) trials, report hemoglobin stabilization, reduced red blood cell transfusions, decreased hemolysis, and improved fatigue among patients with PNH. Importantly, eculizumab is the only approved therapy to treat women with PNH during pregnancy, reducing mortality and the incidence of thrombotic events.

- **Summary of end points of key trials**: Key trials of novel anticomplement-directed therapies in patients with PNH.
- **Drug formulation and dosing reference**: Drug formulation and dosing information for eculizumab.
- **Mechanism of action**: Complement inhibitors and their effects on the complement cascade, including factor B (FB), factor D (FD), and complement membrane attack complex (MAC).

### How we'll treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^117P2fs6]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Emerging questions in the era of proximal complement inhibitors:

The introduction of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH led to the description of C3-mediated extravascular haemolysis as a novel mechanism of disease in PNH, unmasked by anti-C5 therapy. Now the clinical use of proximal complement inhibitors is raising different questions about our understanding of complement biology in PNH, eventually identifying possible pitfalls of this novel treatment strategy.

- **Pitfalls and caveats of novel anti-complement therapies in PNH**:
	- Novel anti-C5 agents seem as effective as eculizumab, with possible advantages related to longer dosing intervals and easier administration routes (i.e. subcutaneous), which result in more convenient treatment options for patients and care providers.
	- Novel anti-C5 agents may have better pharmacological properties, possibly allowing for deeper C5 inhibition; some data suggest that in some cases this may reduce the risk of pharmacokinetic breakthrough haemolysis, while episodes of pharmacodynamic breakthrough haemolysis associated with complement-amplifying conditions seem unaffected.
	- The safety profile of novel anti-C5 agents seems consistent with that of eculizumab, with the exception of transient autoimmune manifestations, due to drug-target-drug immune complexes in patients switching from eculizumab to other anti-C5 antibodies targeting different C5 epitopes.
	- Novel anti-C5 agents, intrinsically, cannot address the unmet clinical need of C3-mediated extravascular haemolysis.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115tkWNh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

We tested the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation, in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial. Patients received either placebo or eculizumab intravenously; eculizumab was given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900 mg dose, and then 900 mg every other week through week 26. The two primary endpoints were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of packed red cells transfused. Biochemical indicators of intravascular hemolysis and the patients' quality of life were also assessed.

- **Results**: Eighty-seven patients underwent randomization. Stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions was achieved in 49% (21 of 43) of the patients assigned to eculizumab and none (0 of 44) of those assigned to placebo (P < 0.001). During the study, a median of 0 units of packed red cells was administered in the eculizumab group, compared with 10 units in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis, as shown by the 85.8% lower median area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) in the eculizumab group, compared with the placebo group (58,587 vs. 411,822 U per liter; P < 0.001). Clinically significant improvements were also found in the quality of life, as measured by scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy scale.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^116MdgWJ]. Haematologica (2021). High credibility.

Until recently, eculizumab was the only approved treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and since its regulatory approval in 2007, it has changed the paradigm for the treatment of patients with PNH. Long-term experience has established that eculizumab is efficacious and well-tolerated; however, approximately 11–27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved dosages of eculizumab during long-term treatment.

Breakthrough hemolysis, characterized by the return of intravascular hemolysis and reappearance of classical PNH symptoms, may occur due to suboptimal C5 inhibition and/or complement-amplifying conditions (CAC) such as infection, surgery, or pregnancy, which may lead to increased complement activation resulting from higher C3b density. In some patients with suboptimal C5 inhibition or CAC, BTH may be ameliorated by shortening the 2-week dosing interval and/or increasing the dose of eculizumab.

### Incomplete inhibition by eculizumab: Mechanistic evidence for residual C5 activity during strong complement activation [^115LMrUn]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Eculizumab inhibits the terminal, lytic pathway of complement by blocking the activation of the complement protein C5 and shows remarkable clinical benefits in certain complement-mediated diseases. However, several reports suggest that activation of C5 is not always completely suppressed in patients even under an excess of eculizumab over C5, indicating that residual C5 activity may derogate the drug's therapeutic benefit under certain conditions. By using eculizumab and the tick-derived C5 inhibitor coversin, we determined conditions ex vivo in which C5 inhibition is incomplete.

The degree of such residual lytic activity depended on the strength of the complement activator and the resulting surface density of the complement activation product C3b, which autoamplifies via the alternative pathway (AP) amplification loop. At high C3b densities required for binding and activation of C5, both inhibitors reduce but do not abolish this interaction. The decrease in C5 binding to C3b clusters in the presence of C5 inhibitors correlated with the levels of residual hemolysis. However, by employing different C5 inhibitors simultaneously, residual hemolytic activity could be abolished.

The importance of AP-produced C3b clusters for C5 activation in the presence of eculizumab was corroborated by the finding that residual hemolysis after forceful activation of the classical pathway could be reduced by blocking the AP. By providing insights into C5 activation and inhibition, our study delivers the rationale for the clinically observed phenomenon of residual terminal pathway activation.

### Multicenter phase 3 study of the complement inhibitor eculizumab for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^113mwbq9]. Blood (2008). High credibility.

The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab was recently shown to be effective and well-tolerated in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In this study, we extended these observations with an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, 52-week phase 3 clinical safety and efficacy study evaluating eculizumab in a broader PNH patient population. Eculizumab was administered via intravenous infusion at 600 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks; 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later, followed by 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for a total treatment period of 52 weeks.

Ninety-seven patients at 33 international sites were enrolled. Patients treated with eculizumab responded with an 87% reduction in hemolysis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < .001). Baseline fatigue scores in the FACIT-Fatigue instrument improved by 12.2 ± 1.1 points (P < .001). Eculizumab treatment led to an improvement in anemia. The increase in hemoglobin level occurred despite a reduction in transfusion requirements from a median of 8.0 units of packed red cells per patient before treatment to 0.0 units per patient during the study (P < .001). Overall, transfusions were reduced by 52% from a mean of 12.3 to 5.9 units of packed red cells per patient. Forty-nine patients (51%) achieved transfusion independence for the entire 52-week period.

Improvements in hemolysis, fatigue, and transfusion requirements with eculizumab were independent of baseline levels of hemolysis and degree of thrombocytopenia. Quality of life measures were also broadly improved with eculizumab treatment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of eculizumab in the management of PNH.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, specifically related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimens, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Cyclophosphamide-antithymocyte globulin conditioning**: Administer in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients receiving matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation.

- **Fludarabine-containing conditioning**: Administer in adult patients or patients with a high risk of graft failure. Also administer in patients receiving matched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation, cord blood transplantation, or haplo-hematopoietic cell transplantation.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^117Wjrjd]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

- **Evaluation of complement pathway during acute sickle cell crises**: A graphic representation of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, vaso-occlusive crisis, and drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia episode is notable:
	- **(1A) Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR)**: The patient received a transfusion (black arrows) on day one and presented with DHTR on day 7 with a hemoglobin (HGB) of 9.4 g/dL, which dropped to a nadir of 5.6 g/dL by day 8 along with absolute reticulocytopenia, as expected in DHTR. Thrombocytopenia coincided with this severe anemia and elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (T. Bili), and aspartate transaminase (AST). Other evidence for intravascular hemolysis included reduced haptoglobin (< 14; reference 30–120 mg/dL) and elevated plasma free HGB (120; reference < 30 mg/dL), not shown.
	- Eculizumab (E) 600 mg was initiated on day 8 and given weekly for a total of four doses. The patient developed acute chest syndrome (ACS) and received one unit of crossmatch compatible, U-negative red blood cells (RBC) following a dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on day 9. The resolution of hemolysis was evidenced by improvement in LDH and HGB following the first dose of eculizumab and maintained throughout the hospital stay. Thrombocytopenia recovered within one week of complement inhibition. The patient required an additional transfusion on day 19 from rebound anemia likely secondary to frequent blood draws, since markers of hemolysis and complement activation on day 22 did not worsen.

### Advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^116GMvN6]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

In the era of eculizumab, the number of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has decreased significantly. However, owing to the possibility of severe aplastic anemia (AA) or a suboptimal response to eculizumab, HSCT still plays an important role in the treatment of patients with PNH combined with AA or hemolysis-related symptoms despite its high level of risk. Here, we review studies involving patients with PNH who underwent HSCT over the past 15 years and conclude that patients with refractory AA/PNH and patients with severe classical PNH are candidates for HSCT in countries where eculizumab is unavailable. The major causes of death from transplantation include graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, and thrombotic microangiopathy. A haploidentical donor is a potential choice for patients without an HLA-matched donor. In addition, the use of eculizumab in combination with HSCT may help prevent GVHD.

### Ultomiris [^116q6KrM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The study in eculizumab-experienced adult patients with PNH [ALXN1210-PNH-302; NCT03056040] was a 26-week, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority Phase 3 study. It was conducted in 195 patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past six months.

Patients who demonstrated stable disease after eculizumab treatment for at least six months were randomized 1:1 to continue with eculizumab or switch to Ultomiris, administered intravenously. The mean total PNH granulocyte clone size was 83%, the mean total PNH monocyte clone size was 86%, and the mean total PNH RBC clone size was 60%. Ninety-five percent of patients had a documented PNH-associated condition diagnosed prior to enrollment: anemia (67%), hematuria or hemoglobinuria (49%), history of aplastic anemia (37%), history of renal failure (9%), myelodysplastic syndrome (5%), pregnancy complication (7%), and other conditions (14%).

- **Baseline characteristics**: Major characteristics were balanced between the two treatment groups. Efficacy was established based on the change in hemolysis as measured by LDH percent change from baseline to Day 183. Supportive efficacy data included transfusion avoidance, the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin, and the proportion with breakthrough hemolysis through Day 183.

Non-inferiority of Ultomiris to eculizumab was demonstrated across endpoints.

### C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with eculizumab [^1139omui]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Ravulizumab (Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Boston, MA) is another anti‐C5 humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of adults with PNH by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Ravulizumab differs structurally from eculizumab by the substitution of four amino acids that extend its circulating half‐life. It has been shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab for transfusion avoidance and hemoglobin stabilization. Currently, there are no therapeutic options that address extravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH.

Given the clinical impact of C3‐mediated extravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH, research into C3 as a possible therapeutic target is warranted. We hypothesized that in subjects with PNH who remained anemic during treatment with eculizumab, complement blockade at the level of C3 with pegcetacoplan (APL‐2; Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA) would improve hemoglobin levels and provide more complete hemolysis control.

Pegcetacoplan is an investigational, targeted C3 inhibitor consisting of two 15‐amino acid cyclic peptides conjugated to a linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule to increase its half‐life. Pegcetacoplan binds to C3 and inhibits its activation. It also binds to and prevents the activity of C3b, inhibiting the activity of convertases containing a C3b subunit, including C3 and C5 convertases associated with the alternative pathway, as well as the C5 convertase associated with the classical pathway. We report the results from an open‐label, phase Ib study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics…

### C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with eculizumab [^1136n4UH]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, life-threatening hematologic disease characterized by chronic complement-mediated hemolysis and thrombosis. Despite treatment with eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, 72% of individuals remain anemic. Pegcetacoplan (APL-2), a PEGylated C3 inhibitor, has the potential to provide more complete hemolysis control in patients with PNH.

This open-label, phase Ib study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH who remained anemic during treatment with eculizumab. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were also assessed as an exploratory objective of this study. Data are presented for six subjects in cohort 4 who received treatment for up to two years.

In total, 427 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported, 68 of which were possibly related to the study drug. Eight serious TEAEs occurred in two subjects; three of these events were considered possibly related to the study drug. Pegcetacoplan pharmacokinetic concentrations accumulated with repeated dosing, and steady state was reached at approximately 6–8 weeks.

Lactate dehydrogenase levels were well controlled by eculizumab at baseline. Pegcetacoplan increased hemoglobin levels and decreased both reticulocyte count and total bilirubin in all six subjects. Improvements were observed in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scores.

Two subjects discontinued for reasons unrelated to pegcetacoplan. All four subjects who completed the study transitioned to pegcetacoplan monotherapy following eculizumab discontinuation.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115VLpMV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

The TRIUMPH study, published by Hillmen P. and colleagues in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines the effect of eculizumab on patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

- **Study design**: A multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted.
- **Population**: The trial included 87 patients, comprising 52 females and 35 males.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria were eligible to participate.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions were complement deficiency, active bacterial infection, history of meningococcal disease, and previous bone marrow transplantation.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Eculizumab group**: 43 patients received an intravenous dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg one week later and then 900 mg every other week through week 26.
	- **Placebo group**: 44 patients received a matching placebo.
- **Primary outcome**: The trial reported a significant increase in the stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions (49% vs. 0%; ARD 49, 95% CI 19.93 to 78.07).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant decrease in units of packed red cells transfused (0 vs. 10; MD -10, 95% CI -15.93 to -4.07).
	- A significant increase was observed in the change in quality of life during treatment, as measured by the global health status scale (10.9 points vs. -8.5 points; MD 19.4, 95% CI 7.89 to 30.91).
- **Safety outcomes**: There was a significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (9% vs. 20%).

In conclusion, the study found that in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, eculizumab led to increased stabilization of hemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements, and improved quality of life, with a favorable safety profile.

### Treating C3 glomerulopathy with eculizumab [^111ifott]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, high-range urinary protein might also lead to accelerated renal elimination of eculizumab and, therefore, weaken the treatment response to eculizumab, since therapeutic drug levels might not be maintained. In these cases, careful evaluation of complement activity, such as CH50, as an indicator of total complement activity or eculizumab serum concentrations might be helpful to detect possible underdosing.

In contrast to aHUS, where eculizumab represents a successful therapy, response rates in C3G patients are heterogeneous. C3G and aHUS share uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway and pathophysiological key regulators, such as mutations in complement factors or autoantibodies. However, the two diseases display fundamental differences: in aHUS, complement activation occurs on endothelial surfaces, leading to endothelial damage and thrombus formation. In C3G, complement activation occurs predominantly in the fluid phase, resulting in excess formation of activated C3 and cleavage products, which are deposited in the kidney and raise glomerular damage. Despite eculizumab-driven blockage of the terminal complement cascade, upstream C3 cleavage products may cause continuing glomerular damage. This provides reasons for diverging response rates to eculizumab in aHUS and C3G. Therefore, further studies evaluating other complement inhibitors, such as the emerging group of C3-convertase inhibitors, are needed. In this context, genetic and immunologic screening with registration of relevant mutations, such as the CFHR5 genotype of patient DDD2 in the C3G database, is crucial.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^113D3aMN]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

This collection of cases emphasizes an underappreciated role of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (CM-TMA) and the complement system across a broad range of sickle cell disease (SCD) presentations. It may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of acute exacerbations of SCD that could be sensitive to complement inhibition, potentially helping to avoid severe hemolytic complications in SCD.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^111Wc7Go]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Ravulizumab offers immediate, complete, and sustained inhibition of complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis at 8-week dosing intervals. In clinical trials, weight-based doses of ravulizumab demonstrated non-inferiority and a comparable safety profile to approved fixed-dose eculizumab in patients with PNH, with durable efficacy and tolerance for up to 4 years following a switch from fixed-dose eculizumab. Although a single case describing treatment switch from high-dose eculizumab to standard weight-based ravulizumab has been reported, there are currently no clinical trial data reporting the feasibility and safety of this switch in patients with PNH.

Here, we report findings from study 401 (NCT04320602), a phase IV, single-arm, two-center trial conducted in the UK between April 2021 and December 2022 that was designed to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of switching treatment from high-dose intravenous eculizumab (1,200 mg Q2W) to weight-based intravenous ravulizumab Q8W in patients with PNH. Included patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a documented diagnosis of PNH, who had received high-dose intravenous eculizumab for ≥ 3 months prior to screening and had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≤ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN; 281.0 U/L, central laboratory assessment) at screening. All patients had received meningococcal vaccines A/C/Y/W-135 conjugate and B within 3 years prior to the start of the study. Key exclusion criteria were body weight < 40 kg at screening and a history of major adverse vascular events within 6 months prior to enrollment.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sustained eculizumab treatment in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^112FG2Yq]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with eculizumab resulted in sustained haematological improvement in patients. Transfusion independence was achieved by 52% (102 of 195) of patients within the first 6 months of treatment, which increased to 82% by the last 6 months of treatment. The number of units of PRBCs transfused was reduced by 55% over the 36-month period. In addition, there was a continuous improvement in haemoglobin levels, which was achieved despite the reduction in transfusions.

The standard eculizumab maintenance dose of 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis in 89% of patients. In the 21 patients who reported breakthrough haemolysis, shortening the dosing interval to less than 14 days was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis, and none of these patients discontinued treatment due to a lack of therapeutic effect. It is important that patients be monitored for any signs or symptoms of breakthrough haemolysis, so that the dosing can be adjusted accordingly. In cases of persistent breakthroughs, it is essential to ensure the patient has not developed human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) or neutralizing antibodies to eculizumab.

Subsequent to the end of the study, a more sensitive analysis became available for the identification of HAHA in patients receiving eculizumab. With this new analysis, two of the patients in the long-term extension study were found to have low positive values for neutralizing antibodies, which exceeded the prespecified threshold for the in vitro assay (data not shown). This finding had no impact on the clinical response to eculizumab.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^114z47vU]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

For diagnostic investigations of aplastic anemia, particularly in evaluating inherited AA, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive assessment. This includes family history, abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and evaluation for extra-hematopoietic abnormalities such as liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, or renal anomalies. These factors should be used to support a diagnosis of constitutional rather than idiopathic bone marrow failure.

### Voydeya [^116zcSkz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: VOYDEYA is indicated as an add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab for the treatment of extravascular hemolysis (EVH) in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). VOYDEYA is a complement factor D inhibitor indicated as an add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab for the treatment of EVH in adults with PNH.

- **Limitations of use**: VOYDEYA has not been shown to be effective as monotherapy and should only be prescribed as an add-on to ravulizumab or eculizumab.

### Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia: Evidence-based guidelines from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy [^1163W7Qh]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, more specifically with respect to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend considering either a calcineurin inhibitor with methotrexate or post-transplant cyclophosphamide as GvHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing matched-related donor or matched-unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation.

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a severe aplastic anemia working party trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^113VjjAi]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Acquired aplastic anemia is a rare disease defined by peripheral pancytopenia associated with hypocellularity of the bone marrow. The aim of treatment for aplastic anemia is to improve peripheral blood counts and achieve transfusion independence. For younger patients (≤ 40 years old) with a matched sibling donor, the first-line treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). For adult patients not eligible for SCT, the standard of care is immunosuppressive therapy (IST), which includes a combination of horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA).

In contrast to patients undergoing SCT, those treated with IST are not cured of their disease and face risks of late complications, such as relapse and development of late clonal diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, the delayed recovery of peripheral blood counts makes patients susceptible to infectious and hemorrhagic complications.

Immunosuppression remains a suboptimal treatment, as about 30% of patients fail to respond and even responding patients often have subnormal blood counts, potentially necessitating maintenance IST with CSA. Efforts have been made over the past 40 years to improve the standard horse ATG plus CSA treatment. Other immunosuppressive combinations, as well as the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide, have been evaluated without the expected breakthroughs. Great hopes have been placed in the development of hematopoietic growth factors. The role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in this context remains a critical area of investigation.

### Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) vs eculizumab in adult patients with PNH naive to complement inhibitors: The 301 study [^1151xPQf]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Ravulizumab (ALXN1210), a new complement C5 inhibitor, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition. This phase 3, open-label study assessed the noninferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naive adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and at least one PNH symptom were randomized 1:1 to receive ravulizumab or eculizumab for 183 days (N = 246).

- **Coprimary efficacy end points**: Proportion of patients remaining transfusion-free and LDH normalization.

- **Secondary end points**: Percent change from baseline in LDH, change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score, proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, stabilized hemoglobin, and change in serum free C5.

Ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab for both coprimary and all key secondary end points (P < .0001): transfusion avoidance (73.6% vs. 66.1%; difference of 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), -4.66, 18.14]), LDH normalization (53.6% vs. 49.4%; odds ratio, 1.19 [0.80, 1.77]), percent reduction in LDH (-76.8% vs. -76.0%; difference [95% CI], -0.83% [-5.21, 3.56]), change in FACIT-Fatigue score (7.07 vs. 6.40; difference [95% CI], 0.67 [-1.21, 2.55]), breakthrough hemolysis (4.0% vs. 10.7%; difference [95% CI], -6.7% [-14.21, 0.18]), and stabilized hemoglobin (68.0% vs. 64.5%; difference [95% CI], 2.9 [-8.80, 14.64]).

The safety and tolerability of ravulizumab and eculizumab were similar; no meningococcal infections occurred. In conclusion, ravulizumab demonstrates comparable outcomes to eculizumab.

### Eculizumab for treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^111Po3fH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a chronic, non-malignant disease of the hematopoietic stem cells, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1.3 new cases per one million individuals per year. The treatment of PNH has been largely empirical and symptomatic, utilizing blood transfusions, anticoagulation, and supplementation with folic acid or iron. Eculizumab, a biological agent that inhibits the complement cascade, was developed for preventing hemolytic anemia and severe thrombotic episodes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical benefits and harms of eculizumab for treating patients with PNH.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to 15 May 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 25 June 2014), and LILACS (from 1982 to 25 June 2014). We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of their publication status or language. No limits were applied with respect to the period of follow-up. We excluded quasi-RCTs. We included trials comparing eculizumab with placebo or best available therapy. We included any patient with a confirmed diagnosis of PNH. The primary outcome was overall survival.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently performed a duplicate selection of eligible trials, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 1 trial: Crovalimab versus eculizumab in complement inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^115D5VJC]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Crovalimab, a novel C5 inhibitor, allows for low-volume, every-4-week, subcutaneous self-administration. COMMODORE 1 (NCT04432584) is a phase 3, global, randomized trial evaluating crovalimab versus eculizumab in C5 inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Adults with lactate dehydrogenase ≤ 1.5× upper limit of normal and receiving approved eculizumab doses for ≥ 24 weeks were randomized 1:1 to receive crovalimab (weight-based tiered dosing) or continue eculizumab.

The original primary study objective was efficacy; however, given the evolving treatment landscape, target recruitment was not met, and all efficacy endpoints became exploratory, with safety as the new primary objective. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included transfusion avoidance, hemolysis control, breakthrough hemolysis, hemoglobin stabilization, FACIT-Fatigue score, and patient preference (crovalimab vs. eculizumab). Eighty-nine patients were randomized (45 to crovalimab; 44 to eculizumab).

During the 24-week primary treatment period, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 77% of patients receiving crovalimab and 67% receiving eculizumab. No AEs led to treatment withdrawal or death, and no meningococcal infections occurred. Sixteen percent of crovalimab-treated patients had transient immune complex reactions (also known as Type III hypersensitivity events), an expected risk when switching between C5 inhibitors that bind to different C5 epitopes. Most were mild/moderate, and all resolved without treatment modification. Crovalimab-treated patients had sustained terminal complement activity inhibition.

### Sustained response and long-term safety of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^1169NPHg]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematologic disorder characterized by the clonal expansion of red blood cells (RBCs) lacking the ability to inhibit complement-mediated hemolysis. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the C5 complement protein, effectively blocks serum hemolytic activity. This study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 11 patients with PNH during an open-label extension trial. After completing an initial 12-week study, all patients chose to participate in the 52-week extension study.

Eculizumab, administered at 900 mg every 12 to 14 days, was sufficient to completely and consistently block complement activity in all patients. A dramatic reduction in hemolysis was maintained throughout the study, with a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels from 3110.7 IU/L before treatment to 622.4 IU/L (P = 0.002). The proportion of PNH type III RBCs increased from 36.7% at baseline to 58.4% (P = 0.005). The paroxysm rate of days with gross evidence of hemoglobinuria per patient each month decreased from 3.0 during screening to 0.2 (P < .001) during treatment. The median transfusion rate decreased from 1.8 U per patient each month before eculizumab treatment to 0.3 U per patient each month (P = 0.001) during treatment. Statistically significant improvements in quality-of-life measures were also maintained during the extension study.

Eculizumab continued to be safe and well tolerated, and all patients completed the study. The close relationship between sustained terminal complement inhibition, hemolysis, and symptoms was demonstrated.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with moderate aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia treated with daclizumab [^113fpWLd]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia and moderate aplastic anemia are marrow failure states with an immune pathogenesis. Previously, we described short-term improvements in blood counts in two pilot studies treating moderate aplastic anemia (mAA) and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) patients with daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin-2 receptor; we now report our long-term experience with a larger cohort of patients.

- **Design and methods**: After a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 19 of 45 (42%) evaluable mAA patients and 10 of 26 (38%) patients with PRCA responded by three months, and two additional mAA patients responded by six months following administration of the drug.

- **Results**: Seven of 28 (25%) mAA patients achieved long-term packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion independence, and all PRCA responders achieved long-term PRBC transfusion independence.

- **Conclusions**: Red cell transfusion-independence prior to treatment in mAA patients predicted response. The only significant adverse treatment-related events were transient rashes and arthralgias. Daclizumab is safe and effective and produces lengthy remissions in patients with PRCA and mAA.

### Eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1155kTH7]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

The complement system plays a central part in both innate and acquired immunity, but the contribution of complement activation to pathobiology is largely ancillary. An exception to the non-dominant role of complement in disease is the haemolytic anaemia of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). The intravascular haemolysis that is the clinical hallmark of PNH is a consequence of deficiency of the complement inhibitory proteins decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59).

Eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds and prevents activation of complement C5 and the subsequent formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement. Eculizumab inhibits the intravascular haemolysis of PNH, reduces transfusion requirements, stabilises haemoglobin concentration, and improves quality of life. Although chronic treatment with eculizumab increases the risk of infections with Neisseria meningitidis, the drug is generally safe and well tolerated. However, as is the case with other drugs developed for treatment of ultra-orphan diseases, eculizumab is expensive and treatment must continue indefinitely because C5 inhibition does not affect the process, i.e. clonal proliferation of haemopoietic stem cells with a mutant phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation class A (PIGA) gene, that underlies PNH. Moreover, due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, treatment with eculizumab is not appropriate for all patients with PNH.

### How we'll treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Diving into the future [^1116nhhk]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

In two large phase III studies, involving patients either naive to or previously treated with eculizumab, ravulizumab was shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab. This was determined by normalization and percentage change in LDH, transfusion avoidance, rates of breakthrough haemolysis, and haemoglobin stabilization during the 26‐week primary evaluation period. Improvements in fatigue and quality of life outcomes were also comparable between eculizumab and ravulizumab. An open‐label extension of phase III studies demonstrated durable efficacy and consistent safety. Ravulizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and should soon be available in most European countries.

Crovalimab (RO7112689 or SKY59; Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) is a sequential, highly soluble monoclonal antibody recycling technology (SMART) antibody, allowing for small injection volumes. Crovalimab was engineered for extended, self‐administered subcutaneous dosing of small volumes in diseases eligible for C5 inhibition. Moreover, epitope recognition of C5 by crovalimab differs from that of eculizumab and ravulizumab, allowing binding on a single missense C5 heterozygous mutation (c.2654G→A, single nucleotide polymorphism). This mutation is present in approximately 3% of the Japanese population and is associated with a lack of response to eculizumab.

A three-part open‐label adaptive phase I/II trial was conducted to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy in healthy volunteers (part 1), as well as in complement blockade‐naive (part 2) and C5 inhibitor‐treated (part 3) PNH patients.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: A phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^113hSp4V]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Over the treatment period, 12 out of 18 patients (66.7%) avoided transfusion. In previous trials of ravulizumab in patients with PNH, transfusion avoidance levels of 76.6% and 86.5% were reported following one year of treatment; the lower proportion in this study may be due to the smaller sample size, the shorter follow-up, and differences in the patient populations.

- **Main limitation**: The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, which precludes formal statistical comparisons. This was expected, given that this study was based on a subpopulation of patients with a rare disease receiving a dose above the approved fixed-dose regimen. In addition, the study recruited patients from two referral centers in a single country; consequently, the findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalizable to the wider PNH population. Finally, only patients receiving eculizumab 1,200 mg Q2W were included in the study, so findings may not be applicable to the small proportion of patients requiring even higher doses of eculizumab.

In summary, switching treatment from high-dose intravenous eculizumab (1,200 mg Q2W) to standard, weight-based intravenous ravulizumab resulted in minimal changes in laboratory measures at an improved dosing interval, with no new safety signals reported. Our findings support the use of weight-based ravulizumab as a suitable and well-tolerated alternative to eculizumab.

### Outcomes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in the pediatric age group in a resource-constrained setting [^116toHHL]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired clonal stem cell disorder. Eculizumab and bone marrow transplantation are disease-modifying treatments for PNH but may not be readily available in resource-constrained settings. Of 52 pediatric patients with PNH, 20 had classical PNH, and 32 had PNH/aplastic anemia (PNH/AA). The median time to diagnosis was 30 months in classical PNH patients.

- **Clinical outcomes**: Renal failure was present in four patients (20%). Six patients (30%) achieved complete response, and ten (50%) achieved partial response with androgens in classical PNH. Two patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

- **PNH/AA group outcomes**: In the PNH/AA group, 16 patients (50%) achieved complete response, and seven (21%) achieved partial response with anti-thymocyte globulin ± cyclosporine.

### When to stop eculizumab in complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies [^117AXE9x]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The terminal complement-inhibitor eculizumab has dramatically changed the management of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and has also shown promise for treating certain forms of secondary HUS (sHUS), including those caused by drugs and solid-organ/hematopoietic stem cell transplants. While effective, eculizumab is costly and inconvenient. In this review, we evaluate the literature on eculizumab cessation in these diseases to better inform clinicians who consider stopping therapy. Reported relapse rates in aHUS after stopping eculizumab are as high as 30%, suggesting indefinite therapy is reasonable and that patients who choose to stop should be closely monitored. In sHUS, relapse is rare, justifying short courses of eculizumab.

### Empaveli [^113MNFcg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The study enrolled patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who had been treated with a stable dose of eculizumab for at least the previous three months and had hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 10.5 g/dL.

Eligible patients entered a four-week run-in period, during which they received EMPAVELI at a dose of 1,080 mg subcutaneously twice weekly, in addition to their dose of eculizumab. Patients were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1,080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly or their dose of eculizumab throughout the 16-week randomized controlled period (RCP).

Randomization was stratified based on the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within the 12 months prior to Day -28 (< 4; ≥ 4) and platelet count at screening (< 100,000/mm³; ≥ 100,000/mm³). Following the completion of the RCP, all patients entered a 32-week open-label period (OLP) and received monotherapy with EMPAVELI. Patients initially randomized to eculizumab entered a second four-week run-in period during which they received EMPAVELI in addition to eculizumab before continuing on to receive EMPAVELI monotherapy. All patients who completed the 48-week period were eligible to enroll in a separate long-term extension study.

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Severe Aplastic Anemia Working Party Trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^113szEYP]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

The cumulative incidence of late complications in patients with severe aplastic anemia treated with horse antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, was studied.

- **Cumulative incidence of relapse**: Patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) treated with horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), showed varying relapse rates.

- **Cumulative probability of being transplanted**: The probability of undergoing transplantation, with death without a transplant as the competing event, was analyzed in patients with SAA treated first-line with horse ATG and CSA, with or without G-CSF.

- **Cumulative incidence of clonal evolution to a hematologic malignancy**: This was observed for myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or isolated cytogenetic abnormality in patients treated with horse ATG and CSA, with or without G-CSF.

- **Cumulative incidence of any late event**: The study looked at the incidence of any late event, such as relapse, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, isolated cytogenetic abnormality, solid cancer, clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aseptic osteonecrosis, or chronic kidney disease, in patients with SAA treated with horse ATG and CSA, with or without G-CSF.

### C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with eculizumab [^114JcFyn]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, life-threatening hematologic disease characterized by chronic complement-mediated hemolysis and thrombosis. Despite treatment with eculizumab, a C5 inhibitor, 72% of individuals remain anemic. Pegcetacoplan (APL-2), a PEGylated C3 inhibitor, has the potential to provide more complete hemolysis control in patients with PNH.

This open-label, phase Ib study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pegcetacoplan in subjects with PNH who remained anemic during treatment with eculizumab. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were also assessed as an exploratory objective of this study. Data are presented for six subjects in cohort 4 who received treatment for up to two years.

In total, 427 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported, 68 of which were possibly related to the study drug. Eight serious TEAEs occurred in two subjects; three of these events were considered possibly related to the study drug. Pegcetacoplan pharmacokinetic concentrations accumulated with repeated dosing, and steady state was reached at approximately 6–8 weeks. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were well controlled by eculizumab at baseline. Pegcetacoplan increased hemoglobin levels and decreased both reticulocyte count and total bilirubin in all six subjects. Improvements were observed in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scores. Two subjects discontinued for reasons unrelated to pegcetacoplan. All four subjects who completed the study transitioned to pegcetacoplan monotherapy following eculizumab treatment.

### Nationwide survey on the use of eltrombopag in patients with severe aplastic anemia: A report on behalf of the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia [^116ED51f]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Few therapeutic options are available for patients with aplastic anemia who are ineligible for transplantation or refractory to immunosuppressive therapy. Eltrombopag was recently shown to produce trilineage responses in refractory patients; however, the effects of real-life use of this drug remain unknown.

This retrospective study (2012–2016) was conducted by the French Reference Center for Aplastic Anemia on patients with relapsed/refractory aplastic anemia, and patients ineligible for antithymocyte globulin or transplantation, who received eltrombopag for at least 2 months. Forty-six patients with aplastic anemia were given eltrombopag without prior antithymocyte globulin treatment (n = 11) or after antithymocyte globulin administration (n = 35) in a relapsed/refractory setting. Eltrombopag (median daily dose 150 mg) was introduced 17 months (range, 8–50) after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. At last follow-up, 49% were still receiving treatment, 9% had stopped due to a robust response, 2% due to toxicity, and 40% due to eltrombopag failure. Before eltrombopag treatment, all patients received regular transfusions. The overall rates of red blood cell and platelet transfusion independence were 7%, 33%, 46%, and 46% at 1, 3, 6 months, and last follow-up. Responses were slower to develop in antithymocyte treatment-naïve patients. In patients achieving transfusion independence, hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts improved by 3 g/dL (interquartile range, 1.4–4.5) and 42×10⁹/L (interquartile range, 11–100), respectively. Response in at least one lineage occurred according to Natio.

### Complement gene variant effect on relapse of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy after eculizumab cessation [^112LMLBG]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Suggested framework for consideration of eculizumab discontinuation in CM-TMA:

- **The role of complement inhibitor therapy**: The discontinuation of therapy is less clear in the setting of these "noncomplement" variants. Note that the study had a small number of patients with variants in these genes, which should be considered when making decisions regarding complement inhibitor duration.

The main limitations of our study include its retrospective nature. The presented population pulls predominantly from retrospective cohorts, case series, and individual case reports, some of which were published when experience regarding use and discontinuation of terminal complement inhibitors was minimal, leading to heterogeneous treatment of CM-TMA events.

Only one clinical trial designed to evaluate the predictive role of factors, including genetic variants in CM-TMA, has been published at the time of writing. Other prospective trials included in this study were not designed or powered to evaluate the possible discontinuation of complement inhibition therapy in CM-TMA but rather to assess the efficacy of eculizumab in this disorder and, as such, are limited with regards to the level of detail when reporting complement gene variants. Similarly, in the setting of this single prospective trial designed to investigate the risk of relapse after eculizumab discontinuation, the cohort does not provide insight on other laboratory assessments (i.e. complement serology, urine protein/creatinine ratio) that may prove to be useful for relapse risk stratification after eculizumab discontinuation.

### Impact of eculizumab treatment on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A treatment versus no-treatment study [^114AtsKZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can effectively be controlled with eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds complement protein C5. We report here a retrospective comparison study between 123 patients treated with eculizumab in the recent period (> 2005) and 191 historical controls (from the French registry). Overall survival (OS) at 6 years was 92% (95% CI, 87 to 98) in the eculizumab cohort versus 80% (95% CI 70 to 91) in historical controls diagnosed after 1985 (HR 0.38 [0.15 to 0.94], P = 0.037). There were significantly fewer thrombotic events (TEs) in the group of patients treated with eculizumab (4% [1–10]) as compared to the historical cohort (27% [20–34]). However, we found that TEs may still occur after the initiation of eculizumab treatment and that previous TEs still have a negative impact on survival. Evolutions to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia were similar in both cohorts. There was less evolution to aplastic anemia in the treatment group. In multivariate analysis, absence of a previous TE and treatment with eculizumab were associated with a better OS. Treatment with eculizumab improves overall survival in classic PNH patients without increasing the risk of clonal evolution.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 2 trial: Crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naive to complement inhibition [^116WSacv]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Crovalimab is a novel C5 complement inhibitor that enables rapid and sustained C5 inhibition with subcutaneous, low-volume self-administration every four weeks. COMMODORE 2 (NCT04434092) is a global, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial evaluating the non-inferiority of crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria not previously treated with C5 inhibition. C5 inhibitor-naive patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized 2:1 to crovalimab or eculizumab.

- **Primary efficacy outcomes**: The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients with hemolysis control (centrally assessed LDH ≤ 1.5× ULN) and the proportion with transfusion avoidance.

- **Secondary efficacy outcomes**: Secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportions of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, stabilized hemoglobin, and change in FACIT-Fatigue score. The primary treatment period was 24 weeks.

Two hundred and four patients were randomized (135 crovalimab; 69 eculizumab). Crovalimab was non-inferior to eculizumab in the co-primary endpoints of hemolysis control (79.3% vs. 79.0%; odds ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6, 1.8]) and transfusion avoidance (65.7% vs. 68.1%; weighted difference, -2.8 [-15.7, 11.1]). Additionally, it was non-inferior in the secondary efficacy endpoints of breakthrough hemolysis (10.4% vs. 14.5%; weighted difference, -3.9 [-14.8, 5.3]) and hemoglobin stabilization (63.4% vs. 60.9%; weighted difference, 2.2 [-11.4, 16.3]).

A clinically meaningful improvement in the FACIT-Fatigue score occurred in both arms. Complete terminal complement activity inhibition was generally maintained with crovalimab.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 2 trial: Crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naive to complement inhibition [^111zfiXJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

The study COMMODORE 2 was published in 2024 in the American Journal of Hematology. It focuses on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The trial explored whether crovalimab is noninferior to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naïve patients with this condition. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, involving 204 patients (92 female, 112 male). Inclusion criteria required patients to have paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria without prior complement inhibition. Key exclusion criteria included current or previous complement inhibitor treatment, history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, history of N. meningitidis infection in the past 6 months, or splenectomy in the past 6 months.

- **Interventions**: The study had two groups: 135 patients received crovalimab (weight-based loading IV dose on day 1, followed by subcutaneous doses on days 2, 8, 15, and 22, with a maintenance dose every 4 weeks starting from day 29), and 69 patients received eculizumab (loading dose of 600 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by a maintenance dose of 900 mg on day 29 and every 2 weeks thereafter until 24 weeks).

- **Primary Outcome**: The primary outcome sought to demonstrate the non-inferiority of crovalimab compared to eculizumab in controlling hemolysis through week 25, with 79.3% vs. 79% achieving control (OR 1, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.8).

- **Secondary Outcomes**: There was no significant difference in the rate of patients avoiding transfusion between the two groups.

### Eculizumab for complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy in sickle cell disease [^114MfiQ7]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

All patients and/or their guardians of cases described in this report provided written consent for the off-label use of eculizumab. These patients received meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccinations as part of routine SCD standard-of-care or given right before eculizumab and continued on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen while on treatment.

CM-TMA from an underlying mutation involving the complement regulatory genes is traditionally called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or 'atypical HUS' (aHUS). CM-TMA occurring secondary to complement amplifying disorders such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, malignancy, infections, or autoimmune diseases are termed 'secondary HUS'. The above clinical vignettes suggest that some complications of SCD may also reflect complement activation-induced secondary HUS (Figure 2). As SCD is a chronic hemolytic condition and plasma free HGB and heme can activate complement, additional complement activation during episodes of disease exacerbation may lead to increased hemolysis and a sustained positive feedback loop that leads to life-threatening anemia.

As sickle erythrocytes are uniquely susceptible to complement-mediated damage, this may also result in further exacerbation of the disease. Heme-dependent endothelial dysfunction seen in SCD can also be modulated by complement activation. In addition, heme can regulate the coagulation system, which likely reflects another important feature of SCD pathophysiology that contributes to inflammation and thrombosis. Increased C5a production has also been shown to cause acute lung injury.

### Erythropoietin treatment during complement inhibition with eculizumab in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^117T1U4C]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by intravascular hemolysis leading to anemia and other clinical manifestations. Transfusions are often required to maintain hemoglobin at tolerable levels. A PNH patient with aplastic anemia was treated with the complement inhibitor eculizumab, followed by concurrent treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Eculizumab alone reduced hemolysis, increased PNH red blood cell (RBC) mass, and decreased the need for transfusions. The addition of rHuEpo during eculizumab therapy enhanced erythropoiesis, further increased PNH RBC mass and hemoglobin levels, and rendered the patient transfusion-independent for more than two years. These data show that stimulating erythropoiesis during eculizumab treatment provided additional benefits to a patient with PNH and underlying bone marrow failure.

### The use of eculizumab in gemcitabine induced thrombotic microangiopathy [^112ts53b]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The mainstay of management in chemotherapy-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is discontinuation of the offending drug and treatment of renal failure with dialysis if necessary. The role of plasmapheresis in the management of chemotherapy-induced TMA is limited, and 50% of patients still progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Protein A immunoadsorption is another modality that has demonstrated improvement in chemotherapy-induced TMA. Rituximab has also been used for the treatment of gemcitabine-induced TMA (GiTMA); the exact mechanism by which it is beneficial is unclear, but it most likely decreases immune complexes by targeting B-lymphocytes.

Eculizumab is a novel C5 inhibitor used for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) due to complement factor abnormalities as well as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It prevents the formation of C5a and the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) in the alternate pathway of the complement system, thereby inhibiting inappropriate systemic coagulation. Eculizumab has also been tried in the management of GiTMA with significant improvement in renal function and resolution of hematological parameters. Our patient demonstrated significant improvement in renal function and hematological parameters after the initiation of eculizumab therapy, allowing for discontinuation of hemodialysis and plasmapheresis. Although therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has not been shown to be effective for gemcitabine-associated TMA, it is important to note that it may have helped recovery in our patient. However, it is less likely that there is an antibody-mediated cause in GiTMA, supporting the thought that recovery was most likely in response to eculizumab than TPE.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^1116HS3v]. Haematologica (2021). High credibility.

In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) receiving complement inhibitor therapy, a breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) event represents a loss of disease control. BTH is manifested by classical PNH symptoms and can require blood transfusion, but more critically, it can be associated with the return of morbidity, including potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events. A consensus definition of BTH, derived following a literature review and interviews with PNH experts and prospectively accepted by regulatory authorities, was used in the two phase III studies of ravulizumab to evaluate the incidence and causality of BTH in patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor therapy as well as those who were previously stabilized on eculizumab. In both studies, ravulizumab was shown to be non-inferior to eculizumab on the assessment of BTH, and treatment with ravulizumab was associated with numerically fewer episodes of BTH compared with eculizumab.

The analysis showed that no BTH events in patients treated with weight-based dosing of ravulizumab were associated with elevations in free C5 levels. In contrast, several patients treated with eculizumab across both studies had BTH events that were temporally associated with elevations in free C5 levels (C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL), suggesting these patients may have had suboptimal C5 control. In such cases, it has been shown that BTH can be successfully managed in some patients by adjusting the dosing amount and/or frequency of eculizumab administration.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of switching from eculizumab to ravulizumab in adult patients with aHUS- real-world data [^112V7d26]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The complement factor 5 (C5)-inhibitor eculizumab has been established as the standard of care for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In 2021, the long-acting C5-inhibitor ravulizumab was approved, extending intervals of intravenous treatment from two to eight weeks, resulting in an improvement in quality of life for patients and lowering direct and indirect therapy-associated costs.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective data analysis of 32 adult patients with aHUS (including 10 kidney transplant recipients) treated with eculizumab for at least three months and switched to ravulizumab aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching medication in the real-world setting. Hematologic parameters, kidney function, therapy, and aHUS-associated events were evaluated three months before and until up to 12 months after switching to ravulizumab.

- **Results**: The mean age (range) at ravulizumab initiation was 41 years (19–78 years), and 59% of the patients were female. Genetic analysis was available for all patients, with 72% showing a pathogenic variant. The median time (range) on eculizumab before switching was 20 months (3–120 months). No new events of TMA or worsening of renal function were reported during up to 12 months of follow-up during ravulizumab treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This is the largest, non-industry derived, multicenter retrospective analysis of adult patients with aHUS switching C5-inhibitor treatment from eculizumab to ravulizumab in the real-world setting. Switching to ravulizumab was safe and efficient, resulting in sustained hem.

### Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled study in patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia treated with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a severe aplastic anemia working party trial from the European Group of Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^112ogEFQ]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Early death occurs secondary to infection, bleeding, or complications of severe anemia. Limited data are available on late malignant and non-malignant complications after immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Today, 16 years after initiation, this randomized controlled study is a unique opportunity to assess the long-term outcome of patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) treated with IST.

We thus aimed to evaluate the durability of response to treatment, survival outcomes, and the risk of long-term complications of patients treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

### Targeting therapy to the neuromuscular junction: proof of concept [^115Mpi4z]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Complement inhibitors are in their developmental infancy, but they are a subject of intense interest. Presently, only one first-generation inhibitor, eculizumab, is FDA approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Eculizumab also holds the distinction of being the most expensive medication on the market. The development of more advanced complement-based therapeutics will likely be refined to focus inhibition on specific steps of the activation cascade tailored to specific pathology, as well as enhancing potency. Here we have demonstrated the feasibility of concentrating complement inhibition to a site of pathology, which is an additional refinement needed for complement therapy development.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^113otLo8]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anaemia, specifically in screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend recognizing that small paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones can be detected in up to 50% of patients with aplastic anaemia, usually without evidence of hemolysis. It is important to recognize that large clones are clinically significant and may result in hemolysis, as well as an increased thrombotic risk, such as hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
