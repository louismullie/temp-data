## Question

Octeotride for treatment of esophageal varices

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how octreotide is used for acute esophageal variceal bleeding, including its role, dosing, duration, comparative efficacy, safety, and how guidelines position it within the overall management pathway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathophysiology to anchor why octreotide helps. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics that justify continuous infusion. Next, I will review the strength and quality of evidence for efficacy and outcomes. After that, I need to confirm dosing, duration, and timing relative to endoscopy. I will then compare octreotide with alternatives like terlipressin and somatostatin. I should also examine special populations and safety, including tachyphylaxis. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring and rescue strategies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Acute esophageal variceal bleeding is a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension with a 6-week mortality around 10–20%, so early control of bleeding and prevention of early rebleeding are critical to outcomes, and that frames the urgency of vasoactive therapy and endoscopic hemostasis in the first hours of care [^115ot3iS] [^111PEAPB].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, reduces portal inflow by splanchnic vasoconstriction and inhibition of vasodilatory peptides such as glucagon, thereby lowering portal pressure and variceal flow. Its effects are transient, which is why continuous infusion is required to sustain benefit during the acute phase, and this mechanistic rationale aligns with guideline-endorsed use as first-line vasoactive therapy in suspected variceal hemorrhage [^116L6SDC] [^115aVUFf].

> Now, I should review the evidence base for efficacy. Meta-analyses and randomized trials consistently show that octreotide improves initial control of variceal bleeding and reduces failure of hemostasis compared with placebo or no vasoactive therapy, with a pooled relative risk reduction around 30–40% for failure to control bleeding, though mortality effects are modest and not always statistically significant across all studies, which means the primary benefit is hemostasis and rebleeding prevention rather than a robust mortality signal per se [^115gkiZN] [^1135Gpqv] [^1166yHtb].

> Wait, let me verify comparative efficacy with other vasoactive agents. Large head-to-head trials and meta-analyses show no significant differences in 5-day treatment success, rebleeding, or mortality among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when used as adjuncts to endoscopic therapy, supporting the concept that agent selection can be guided by availability, familiarity, and safety profile rather than presumed superiority of one drug over another in this setting [^113MNNYX] [^116ba79t] [^117M6bFF].

> I should confirm the dosing and duration next. Standard adult dosing is a 50 microgram IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion at 50 micrograms per hour for 2–5 days. Additional 50 microgram boluses can be given in the first hour if bleeding persists, and therapy should continue for at least 2 days and up to 5 days after endoscopic hemostasis to mitigate early rebleeding risk, with the longer end of the range favored when sclerotherapy is used or when liver disease is more severe [^1119ewtb] [^115XstJp] [^115aVUFf] [^114UCxYn].

> Hold on, I should verify timing relative to endoscopy. Guidelines recommend initiating a vasoactive agent as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, ideally before diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy, because early splanchnic vasoconstriction improves visualization and facilitates endoscopic hemostasis; endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours once the patient is stabilized, and erythromycin can be used pre-endoscopy to improve visualization when appropriate [^111PEAPB] [^115aVUFf] [^111Cnsyr].

> Next, I should review how octreotide fits within the multimodal pathway. Octreotide is not a substitute for endoscopic therapy; rather, it is an essential bridge that augments endoscopic success, with endoscopic variceal ligation as the preferred modality for esophageal varices and combined pharmacologic plus endoscopic therapy outperforming either alone for initial and 5-day hemostasis, while antibiotics and restrictive transfusion further reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality in this population [^111PEAPB] [^114HgkYi] [^115VdJCX].

> I will now examine safety and special populations. Octreotide has a favorable safety profile relative to vasopressin and is generally preferred in many settings. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, transient glucose changes, and rare bradyarrhythmias, and tachyphylaxis can occur with prolonged high-dose exposure in cirrhosis, which reinforces the principle of using the shortest effective duration and reassessing need daily. In pregnancy, octreotide is considered acceptable while terlipressin should be avoided due to uterine effects, and in patients with ischemic heart disease, terlipressin warrants caution, further tilting toward octreotide in many U.S. practices [^117U94us] [^112n3nmN] [^117TF9Cu] [^111wcWjs].

> But wait, what about duration nuances and cost-effectiveness. A randomized trial suggested that 2 days of octreotide after endoscopic therapy may be as effective as 5 days for early rebleeding in selected patients, with better cost-efficiency. However, meta-analytic data indicate that shorter durations may be acceptable with band ligation but could underperform with sclerotherapy or in more severe liver disease, so I should be cautious about universal shortening and tailor duration to endoscopic technique and disease severity [^115iJVV3] [^114UCxYn] [^114yJm1H].

> Let me reconsider the overall positioning and guidelines. Contemporary U.S. guidance favors octreotide as the first-line vasoactive agent largely due to availability and safety, while European guidance accepts terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide as equivalent options. Across societies, the consistent themes are early initiation, continuation for 2–5 days after hemostasis, and integration with antibiotics, restrictive transfusion, and timely endoscopic therapy, with rescue TIPS considered for high-risk or refractory cases [^115aVUFf] [^111PEAPB] [^113iPPqj].

> In summary, I need to ensure the practical algorithm is explicit. Start octreotide immediately when variceal bleeding is suspected, give a 50 microgram IV bolus followed by 50 micrograms per hour continuous infusion, continue for 2–5 days after endoscopic hemostasis with longer durations when sclerotherapy is used or liver disease is advanced, perform endoscopy within 12 hours, administer ceftriaxone prophylaxis, transfuse to a restrictive hemoglobin target, and escalate to rescue TIPS if bleeding persists or recurs despite combined therapy, adjusting the plan to patient-specific comorbidities and pregnancy status as indicated [^115XstJp] [^111PEAPB] [^115VdJCX].

Octreotide is a **first-line vasoactive therapy** for acute esophageal variceal bleeding because it rapidly reduces portal pressure and controls bleeding with a favorable safety profile [^115aVUFf] [^116n5YaY]. It is given as a **50 mcg IV bolus followed by 50 mcg/h infusion for 2–5 days**, ideally started before endoscopy and continued after endoscopic hemostasis to prevent early rebleeding [^1119ewtb] [^111PEAPB]. Octreotide is comparable to terlipressin and somatostatin for hemostasis but is preferred in many settings for its safety and availability; it does not improve survival and should be combined with endoscopic therapy and antibiotics [^113MNNYX] [^114HgkYi] [^115VdJCX]. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms and bradycardia; monitor for tachyphylaxis with prolonged use [^112n3nmN].

---

## Mechanism of action

Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, **reduces portal pressure** via splanchnic vasoconstriction, lowering splanchnic blood flow and variceal pressure. It also inhibits vasodilatory peptides (e.g. glucagon, VIP), further decreasing portal inflow and variceal bleeding risk [^114FARRG].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting octreotide use

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show octreotide **improves initial hemostasis** and reduces early rebleeding, though it does not reduce mortality [^1135Gpqv] [^114HgkYi]. A meta-analysis of 21 trials found reduced failure of initial hemostasis (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.87) and fewer transfusions (mean 0.7–1.5 units), but no mortality benefit [^1135Gpqv]. A large RCT showed octreotide was non-inferior to terlipressin and somatostatin for 5-day hemostasis, rebleeding, and mortality [^113MNNYX].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

Current guidelines recommend the following **dosing regimen**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosing** |
|-|-|
| Acute variceal bleeding | - 50 mcg IV bolus <br/> - Then 50 mcg/h continuous infusion for 2–5 days [^1119ewtb] [^115XstJp] |
| Ongoing bleeding | Additional 50 mcg IV bolus may be repeated within the first hour if bleeding persists [^1119ewtb] [^115i7KMC] |

---

Initiate octreotide as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, **ideally before endoscopy**, and continue for 2–5 days after hemostasis to prevent early rebleeding [^111PEAPB] [^115aVUFf].

---

## Comparative efficacy with other vasoactive agents

Octreotide has **similar efficacy** to terlipressin and somatostatin for acute variceal bleeding control, with no significant differences in hemostasis, rebleeding, or mortality [^113MNNYX] [^116ba79t]. It is often preferred for its favorable safety and wide availability, particularly in North America [^115aVUFf].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Octreotide is **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include:

- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps)
- Bradycardia and conduction disturbances
- Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
- Gallbladder sludge or cholelithiasis with prolonged use [^notfound]

Serious adverse events are rare, but **tachyphylaxis** may occur with prolonged infusion, potentially limiting efficacy [^112n3nmN].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

There are **no absolute contraindications** beyond hypersensitivity to octreotide or its components. Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease due to potential bradycardia or conduction effects, and monitor glucose in patients with diabetes [^117U94us].

---

## Integration with other therapies

Octreotide is **most effective when combined** with endoscopic therapy (band ligation or sclerotherapy) and antibiotic prophylaxis (ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily) to reduce rebleeding, infection, and mortality [^114HgkYi] [^115VdJCX]. It is not recommended as monotherapy for acute variceal bleeding.

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from AASLD, AGA, and ESGE recommend octreotide as a **first-line vasoactive agent** for acute variceal bleeding, initiated promptly and continued for 2–5 days after hemostasis [^115XstJp] [^115aVUFf] [^111PEAPB].

---

Octreotide is a **first-line vasoactive therapy** for acute esophageal variceal bleeding, providing rapid hemostasis with a favorable safety profile. It should be integrated with endoscopic therapy and antibiotics, and continued for 2–5 days to prevent early rebleeding.

RX (Treatment)

We recommend intravenous terlipressin is given to all patients with suspected cirrhosis/variceal bleeding. However, caution should be exercised in patients with ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease

Level of evidence: High

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Intravenous terlipressin 2 mg four times a day in case of suspected variceal bleeding (80% agreement)

Variceal bleeding should be suspected in patients presenting with AUGIB who have known cirrhosis or have clinical parameters that would suggest cirrhosis. The UK variceal bleed guidelines recommend administering terlipressin or somatostatin as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, for up to 5 days or until attainment of haemostasis, with octreotide as an alternative. The efficacy of intravenous terlipressin in variceal bleeding has been presented in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 1609). Seven studies (n = 443) compared terlipressin to placebo, of which five were considered to be high quality. This showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (34% relative risk reduction), improved haemostasis and reduced transfusion requirement. Similar results were found in an updated meta-analysis in 2012. A more recent multicentre RCT (n = 780) reported non-inferiority of terlipressin compared with octreotide and somatostatin, with no difference in outcomes of haemorrhage control, rebleeding and mortality. The BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle suggests caution in patients with known ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and mandatory ECG assessment in patients aged over 65 years.

Somatostatin and octreotide

Somatostatin causes selective splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal pressure and portal blood flow. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. The mechanism of action of these two agents is not clear. Inhibition of glucagon increases vasodilatation rather than a direct vasoconstrictive effect and post-prandial gut hyperaemia is also reduced. The actions of octreotide on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics are transient, making continuous infusion necessary. Octreotide is given as a 50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 25–50 μg/h. Somatostatin is given as a 250 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mg/h. Somatostatin and octreotide have been shown to be as effective as terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding in a meta-analysis. Seo et al in a large RCT of 780 patients comparing these three agents failed to show a difference in treatment success (range 83.8–86.2%), rebleeding (range 3.4–4.4%) and mortality (range 8–8.8%). A low systolic blood pressure at presentation, high serum creatinine level, active bleeding in the emergency endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding and Child–Pugh grade C were independent factors predicting 5-day treatment failure.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics that provide Gram-negative cover are one of the interventions which positively influence survival in variceal haemorrhage as shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Antibiotics were also shown to reduce bacterial infections (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97) and early rebleeding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74). Therefore, short-term antibiotics should be considered standard practice in all cirrhotic patients who have a variceal bleed, irrespective of the presence of confirmed infection. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (1 g IV, daily), have been shown to be more effective at reducing Gram-negative sepsis than oral norfloxacin, but choice of antibiotics must be dictated by local resistance patterns and availability.

Pharmacological treatment

The two major classes of drugs that have been used in the control of acute variceal bleeding are vasopressin or its analogues (either alone or in combination with nitroglycerine) and somatostatin or its analogues. Terlipressin is the only agent that has been shown to reduce mortality in placebo-controlled trials. However, in trials comparing terlipressin, somatostatin and octreotide, no difference in efficacy was identified in a systematic reviewand in a recent large RCT. Prophylactic antibiotics can result in a similar survival benefit following acute variceal bleeding.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin reduces portal blood flow, portal systemic collateral blood flow and variceal pressure. It does, however, have significant systemic side effects such as an increase in peripheral resistance, and reduction in cardiac output, heart rate and coronary blood flow. In comparison with no active treatment, the pooled results of four randomised trials showed that it reduced failure to control variceal bleeding (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.43), although survival was unaffected. Meta-analysis of five trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin has shown a significant effect on reduction in failure to control bleeding (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97), with no effect on survival.

Vasopressin with nitroglycerine

The addition of nitroglycerine enhances the effect of vasopressin on portal pressure and reduces cardiovascular side effects. Meta-analysis of three randomised trials comparing vasopressin alone with vasopressin and nitroglycerine showed that the combination was associated with a significant reduction in failure to control bleeding (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72), although no survival benefit was shown.

### Gastric varices: an updated review of management [^113LhK3X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^114zZw6h]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage — initiation of vasoactive therapy is guided by Best Practice Advice 1, which states that vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is described as a major complication of cirrhosis with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%–13% and a 6-week mortality rate of 7%–43% and accounts for approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Vasoactive drugs for AVH can be divided into somatostatin and its analogs (octreotide in most countries) and vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin); these agents work via vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation and thereby reduce portal pressure, can halt acute hemorrhage in up to 80% of cases, and are given intravenously.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^117U94us]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3 — octreotide selection and vasoactive safety: Octreotide is the vasoactive drug of choice in the management of variceal hemorrhage based on its safety profile. Vasopressin is no longer advised in patients with AVH because of a high risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Terlipressin is contraindicated in patients experiencing hypoxia or worsening respiratory symptoms, and those with ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia, and common adverse reactions include abdominal pain, nausea, respiratory failure, diarrhea, and dyspnea. In contrast, octreotide treatment may result in both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and bradycardia and pancreatitis have also been reported, although it is unclear whether the adverse events are due to the drug or patient comorbidities.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of variceal hemorrhage, vasoactive agents, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to administer vasoconstrictors, such as terlipressin or somatostatin, in all patients with variceal hemorrhage, starting as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected and continuing until hemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Consider administering octreotide if terlipressin or somatostatin is unavailable.

### Terlipressin for acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage [^112bLUQL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Terlipressin (triglycyl lysine vasopressin) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, which has been used in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. In contrast to vasopressin, terlipressin can be administered as intermittent injections instead of continuous intravenous infusion and it has a safer adverse reactions profile. However, its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Objectives

To determine if treatment with terlipressin improves outcome in acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage and is safe.

Search Strategy

Randomized clinical trials were identified by searching the following databases (November 1999): The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 1999), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, and Current Contents. The bibliographies of identified publications were checked. Experts in the field and the manufacturers of terlipressin were contacted. For the update of this review, no new randomized clinical trials were identified on any of the databases (October 2002).

Selection Criteria

All randomized clinical trials, which compared terlipressin with: (a) placebo or no treatment, (b) balloon tamponade, (c) endoscopic treatment, (d) octreotide, (e) somatostatin and (f) vasopressin, in the setting of acute variceal hemorrhage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility, trial quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers. The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes were failure of initial hemostasis, rebleeding, procedures required for uncontrolled bleeding or rebleeding, transfusion requirements and length of hospitalization.

Main Results

Twenty studies were identified for all the comparison groups, involving 1609 patients. There were seven studies (with 443 patients) comparing terlipressin to placebo, five of which were considered to be high quality studies based on the Jadad scale. The meta-analysis indicates that terlipressin was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all cause mortality compared to placebo (relative risk 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.88). Three studies (with 302 patients) were identified comparing terlipressin to somatostatin, two of which were high quality studies; only one high quality study (219 patients) comparing terlipressin to endoscopic treatment was identified. Within the limited power provided by these small numbers of patients, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated between terlipressin and either somatostatin or endoscopic treatment in any of the outcomes. For the remaining comparison groups (terlipressin versus balloon tamponade, terlipressin versus octreotide, and terlipressin versus vasopressin) only small, low quality studies were identified and no difference was demonstrated in any of the major outcomes. There was no significant difference between the terlipressin group and any of the comparison groups in the number of adverse events that caused death or withdrawal of medication.

Reviewer's Conclusions

On the basis of a 34% relative risk reduction in mortality, terlipressin should be considered to be effective in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. Further, since no other vasoactive agent has been shown to reduce mortality in single studies or meta-analyses, terlipressin might be the vasoactive agent of choice in acute variceal bleeding.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113tS8WP]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroesophageal varices, more specifically with respect to primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to offer combination therapy of nonselective β-blockers and endoscopic band ligation since it reduces the risk of rebleeding compared with monotherapy.

### Bleeding' downhill'esophageal varices associated with benign superior vena cava obstruction: case report and literature review [^1144G7DL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Providers should be vigilant for bleeding "downhill" varices in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and clinical evidence of SVC obstruction because the pathophysiology of this disorder mandates a unique management compared to esophageal varices occurring in the usual setting of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Though data is lacking, traditional medical management would be unlikely to be of benefit in this population. Octreotide, as a splanchnic dilator would not decrease the pressure in "downhill" varices as they do not communicate directly with the portal system. Proton pump inhibitors would be unlikely to play a role as the upper esophagus is less likely to be influenced by gastric pH. The current literature only provides guidance for therapy by means of case reports and while firm recommendations cannot be made as to ideal therapy in this patient population, several methods of temporization seem to have been successful in halting bleeding until definitive decompression of the affected vessels can be performed. Further investigation is required to determine why benign, as opposed to malignant, causes of SVC obstruction result in bleeding from downhill varices at such a high rate, despite being a less common etiology of SVC obstruction in the general population.

### No difference in mortality between terlipressin and somatostatin treatments in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding and renal functional impairment [^112N1khm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

About 30% of cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices will experience EVB during their lifetime. Mortality rates have been reduced because of improvements in the management of patients with EVB, but the risk of mortality is still high. This large population-based study showed a similar poor outcome because of EVB. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 17.6%.

Besides endoscopic treatment, prophylactic antibiotics and splanchnic vasoconstrictors (such as octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin, or vasopressin) are recommended as first-line treatment if patients are suspected of having acute variceal bleeding. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of vasoactive medications in patients who experience acute variceal bleeding. The use of vasoactive agents can lower the risk of 7-day mortality, improve the hemostatic effect, decrease transfusion requirements, and shorten the duration of hospitalization. However, the choice of splanchnic vasoconstriction agents for EVB remains an important issue.

To date, cumulative randomized prospective studies had been carried out to compare the effectiveness of terlipressin and octreotide for the control of acute variceal bleeding. All of them concluded that the efficiency of terlipressin and octreotide in controlling variceal bleeding was not different in terms of the hemostatic effect, safety, hospital stay, or mortality. In this national population-based study, we compared the mortality between two different vasoactive agents: terlipressin and somatostatin. There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality rate between patients treated with terlipressin versus those treated with somatostatin. We have also provided evidence on similar effects between terlipressin and somatostatin in terms of EVB after EVL. The choice of vasoactive drugs in cases of acute variceal bleeding, therefore, should be made on the basis of drug availability and the physician's experience.

### A multicenter evaluation of adherence to 4 major elements of the baveno guidelines and outcomes for patients with acute variceal hemorrhage [^116ditij]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine the rate of and outcomes associated with guideline adherence in the care of acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH).

Background

Four major elements of high-quality care for AVH defined by the Baveno consensus (VI) include timely endoscopy (≤ 12 h), antibiotics, and somatostatin analogs before endoscopy and band ligation as primary therapy for esophageal varices.

Study

We retrospectively evaluated 239 consecutive admissions of 211 patients with AVH admitted to 2 centers in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2015. The primary outcome was 6-week mortality; secondary outcomes included treatment failure (shock, hemoglobin drop by 3 g/dL, hematemesis, death ≤ 5 d), length of stay, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Guideline adherence was variable: endoscopy ≤ 12 hours (79.9%), antibiotics (84.9%), band ligation (78.7%), and somatostatin analogs (90.8%). However, only 150 (62.8%) received care that was adherent to all indicated criteria. The 6-week mortality rate was 22.6%. Treatment failure occurred in 50 (21.0%) admissions. Among the 198 patients who survived to discharge, 41 (20.7%) were readmitted within 30 days. Octreotide before endoscopy was associated with a reduction in 30-day readmission (18.4% vs. 42.1%; P = 0.03), whereas banding of esophageal varices was associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure (15.0% vs. 50.0%; P ≤ 0.001). However, adherence to quality metrics did not significantly reduce the risk of death within 6 weeks.

Conclusions

Adherence to quality metrics may not reduce the risk of mortality but could improve secondary outcomes of AVH. Variation in practice should be addressed through quality improvement interventions.

Gastrointestinal bleeding

How should gastrointestinal bleeding be managed in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Patients with DC with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should receive ceftriaxone and a vasoactive agent (vasopressin, somatostatin, or octreotide). Ventilated patients with upper GIB (UGIB) should receive a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Viscoelastic testing (VET) can guide use of VTE prophylaxis. Transfusion should be performed with goal hemoglobin (Hb) of 7–8 g/dL (70–80 g/L). Endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours and TIPS should be considered for recurrent or persistent variceal bleeding.

Discussion

Variceal hemorrhage is one of several disease-defining clinical features of DC. In the critically ill trauma or surgical patient presenting to the hospital for a separate indication, DC due to GIB results in a compounding of morbidity and mortality. The most common etiology of GIB in DC is portal hypertension, and spontaneously resolves in only 50% of cases. Failure of combination pharmacological therapy and endoscopy may occur in up to 20%, requiring advanced methods of hemostasis.

Ceftriaxone (1 g intravenous daily) reduces infectious complications, re-bleeding, and mortality in patients with UGIB, regardless of whether it is variceal or non-variceal. The duration of treatment is 7 days but discontinuation can be considered once hemorrhage has resolved and vasoactive drugs have been discontinued.

Mechanically ventilated patients receiving PPI rather than H 2 receptor blockade for prophylaxis experience fewer episodes of clinically important UGIB. Although this effect has not been specifically evaluated for prevention of variceal UGIB, both the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend PPI for patients with cirrhosis requiring mechanical ventilation and suggest a possible benefit of PPI in reducing ulceration size following endoscopic band ligation. If not already initiated as prophylaxis, PPI therapy should be started to reduce recurrence for non-variceal GIB. While chemical VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to provoke GIB, patients with DC with recent GIB may be poor candidates for this, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia (< 50×10 9 /L). However, the coagulation profile of patients with DC as a predictor of bleeding risk is poorly understood and potentially better evaluated by VET over traditional assays. In blood product administration, there is no known benefit to achieving a higher Hb through transfusion in patients with DC as compared with balanced resuscitation with a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy (Hb of 7–8 g/dL).

### Octreotide for acute variceal bleeding [^113EjU33]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use o f octreotide for acute variceal bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were obtained through computerized searches involving MEDLINE (from 1997 to October 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing information on the diagnosis and management of acute variceal bleeding were reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection

All randomized studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used octreotide therapy for acute variceal bleeding were considered. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating variceal bleeding were also reviewed for possible inclusion.

Data Extraction

The primary outcomes extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for endoscopic intervention or balloon tamponade, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Although both endoscopic therapies and medications are used to control bleeding and rebleeding episodes, the endoscopic approach has the additional goal of obliterating the varix. Since rebleeding episodes are common as long as the varix is present, endoscopic and medication therapies cannot be considered interchangeable based on bleeding control alone. However, octreotide by continuous intravenous infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements as both an initial intervention (until definitive sclerotherapy can be performed) or as adjunctive therapy to endoscopic measures. Octreotide can be started quickly, has a relatively rapid onset of action, and does not require someone with endoscopy training to initiate. Additionally, octreotide is relatively free of significant adverse effects.

Conclusions

While additional investigations are needed, particularly in the area of pharmacoeconomics, there is substantial evidence that octreotide is an efficacious therapy with relatively few adverse effects when used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.

### An assessment of the management of acute bleeding varices: a multicenter prospective member-based study [^113fuoFH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is a major complication of portal hypertension. Despite recent practice guidelines for the management of bleeding esophageal or gastric varices, the widespread application of these measures by gastroenterologists has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to continue the concept of membership-based research within diverse practice settings by expanding the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) GI Bleeding Registry to assess the management and outcome of acute variceal bleeding.

Methods

All ACG members (domestic and foreign) were invited to participate during the 1997 Annual Fall meeting and by mail. Data were collected over 12 months. Information obtained included physician training, practice demographics, patient demographics, disease etiology and severity, clinical presentation, medications, transfusion needs, therapy, complications, and rebleeding within 2 wk.

Results

A total of 93 physicians/centers (79.6% domestic, 26.9% university and affiliated, 3.2% Veterans Affairs) participated. Complete demographic data were available for 725 of the 741 patients enrolled with index bleeding. The median age of these 725 patients was 52 yr and 73.3% were male. The most common single etiology for portal hypertension was cirrhosis (94.3%). The most common causes of cirrhosis were alcohol (56.7%), hepatitis C virus (30.3%), and hepatitis B virus (10.0%). Hemodynamic instability was noted in 60.7% of the patients (22.3% tachycardic, 9.7% orthostatic, 28.7% hypotensive). Index interventions included banding (40.8%; median five bands), sclerotherapy (36.3%), combination banding/sclerotherapy (6.2%), octreotide (52.6%; median 3 days), balloon tamponade (5.5%), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (6.6%), liver transplantation (1.1%), surgical shunt (0.7%), and embolization (0.1%). Transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets was given in 83.4%, 44.7%, and 24.6% of the patients with index bleeding, respectively. Median transfusion was four units of packed red blood cells, three units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1.5 units of platelets. Rebleeding occurred in 92 of the 741 patients (12.6%) at a median of 7 days (mean 11 days) and was treated by banding (18.5%; median six bands), sclerotherapy (30.4%), octreotide (63%; median 2 days), balloon tamponade (17.4%), TIPS (15.2%), and surgical shunt (3.3%). Complications from the index bleeding and rebleeding within 2 wk included ulceration (2.6%, 2.2%), aspiration (2.4%, 3.3%), medication side effects (0.8%, 0%), dysphagia (2.3%, 0%), odynophagia (2.2%,0%), encephalopathy (13%,17.4%), and hepatorenal syndrome (2.4%, 2.2%), respectively. After the index bleeding, 46.2% of patients were treated with beta-blockers and 8.2% with nitrates. The majority of patients with index bleeding had Child's B cirrhosis (61.5%). Patients presenting with recurrent bleeding had mostly Child's B (46.7%) or Child's C cirrhosis (44.6%). The overall short-term mortality after index bleeding was 12.9%.

Conclusions

Acute variceal hemorrhage occurs more often in patients with Child's B and C cirrhosis. Endoscopic banding is the most common single endoscopic intervention. Adjunctive pharmacotherapy is prevalent acutely and after stabilization. Both morbidity and mortality may be lower than reported in previous studies.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension: still a therapeutic challenge? [^115yFoxT]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

In the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, beta-blockers continue to be the first-line treatment. Newer nonselective beta-blockers with anti-alpha1-adrenergic activity, such as carvedilol, appear to have a better impact on reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate appears to improve the effectiveness of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis, but not that of somatostatin in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage. The use of vasoactive drugs alone in acute variceal bleeding has not proved to be more effective than endoscopic treatment. The advent of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has strengthened the role of endoscopy in the management of bleeding esophageal varices. EVL has improved the results, particularly in terms of lowering the treatment-related morbidity, compared with endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). However, the variceal recurrence rate after initial eradication with EVL is relatively high. In contrast to synchronous combined therapy with EVL plus EVS, metachronous combination of EVL and low-dose EVS may improve the results of EVL alone. For bleeding fundic varices, obliteration using cyanoacrylate is currently the treatment of choice. Endosonography (EUS) is coming into more widespread use in the assessment of variceal eradication and in further attempts to improve the results of endoscopic injection therapy. According to two meta-analysis studies, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is not yet capable of replacing endoscopic treatment in the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.

### Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices [^1159JUjc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Somatostatin and its derivatives are often used for emergency treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The placebo controlled trials have shown varying results, however, and their power has been quite low. An updated systematic review of a previously published meta-analysis was therefore performed.

Objectives

To study whether somatostatin or analogues improve survival or reduce the number of blood transfusions in patients with suspected or verified acute or recently bleeding oesophageal varices.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched in August 2001. Reference lists of articles and authors.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing somatostatin or analogues with placebo or no treatment in patients suspected of acute bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

The effect variables extracted were: mortality, number of blood transfusions, number with balloon tamponade, number with initial haemostasis and number with rebleeding. Intention to treat analyses were conducted; a random effects analysis was preferred if there was significant heterogeneity between the trials (P < 0.10).

Main Results

The meta-analysis comprised 12 trials and 1452 patients. The active drugs did not reduce mortality significantly (relative risk 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.14). The number of transfusions was less with drugs, the difference between experimental and control therapy was 1.0 units of blood products (95% CI 0.6 to 1.5). Number of patients failing initial haemostasis was also reduced (relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92). There were no significant differences in use of balloon tamponade (relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.24), or in number of patients with rebleeding (relative risk 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.09). It should be noted, however, that the trials were heterogeneous with respect to the secondary outcomes.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The effect corresponded to one unit of blood saved per patient. It can be discussed whether this effect is worthwhile. The findings do not suggest a need for further placebo-controlled studies of somatostatin analogues in acute bleeding from oesophageal varices. On the other hand, the confidence interval for the effect on mortality was wide. Hence, a large placebo controlled trial is needed if one wishes to rule out the possibility that a worthwhile effect on mortality may have been overlooked.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^1134yFA2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of variceal hemorrhage, pharmacotherapy, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to administer octreotide in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage and continue for 3–5 days after endoscopy if variceal hemorrhage is confirmed.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^116EgERE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of medical therapy is to reduce splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure. Drugs currently in use are vasopressin, somatostatin, and terlipressin. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs lowers portal pressure and potentially offers the endoscopist a clearer field to work in and it is the only non-invasive treatment for non-esophagogastric variceal sites of bleeding related to portal hypertension. There are no trials available regarding the use of these vasoactive drugs for the treatment of bleeding ARV, but these drugs are clearly beneficial when used for acute bleeding from gastro-esophageal varices and therefore can be considered for use in bleeding ARV. Vasopressin has a short half-life and should be given as a continuous iv infusion; furthermore, vasopressin has relevant side effects related to the important systemic vasoconstriction that could lead to mesenteric or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, vasopressin is not often used also because Terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analog with a longer half-life and less adverse effects, is effective in bleeding control and has a positive impact on survival. Both somatostatin and octreotide (a synthetic analog of somatostatin with longer half-life) have a good safety profile, and somatostatin is as effective as vasopressin in control of variceal bleeding. A literature review by Biecker analyzed all the studies regarding the use of these drugs for the medical treatment of acute bleeding from esophageal varices and concluded that the available data is most convincing for terlipressin; however, the direct comparison of terlipressin and octreotide revealed no superiority of terlipressin. All the studies mentioned so far regard bleeding from esophageal varices, we can try to extend these indications to the varices of other districts of the body, but the grade of recommendations is necessarily weak and further studies are needed to define the best medical approach to bleeding ARV.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^115W2bCk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Esophageal variceal bleeding in pregnant women with cirrhosis — risk, timing, delivery, and management: Up to 30% of cirrhotic pregnant women bleed during pregnancy, with risk increasing to 50–78% when varices pre-exist, and each episode carries maternal mortality as high as 20–50%. Management during pregnancy is very similar to general variceal bleeding with a focus on endoscopic hemostasis and supportive care; octreotide is a pregnancy category B drug and appears to be safe as an adjunct along with antibiotics, while salvage transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and liver transplantation have been described but are not routinely advocated. For screening, timing is most often prudent in the second trimester, after organogenesis in the first trimester and before the greatest risk of bleeding at delivery. For medical therapy, there are risks with propranolol but it appears overall to be safe in pregnant patients, whereas nadolol is also a category C drug with a long half-life and is not preferred. Regarding delivery, vaginal delivery with a short second stage has traditionally been advocated, yet concerns that prolonged vaginal delivery may increase variceal bleeding owing to repeated Valsalva have led to consideration of cesarean section as an alternative; however, cesarean sections carry increased surgical-site bleeding risk in portal hypertension and there are no data comparing benefits of vaginal vs cesarean delivery.

### Sequential endoscopic treatment for esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding significantly reduces patient mortality and rebleeding rates [^115Jfnvi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding (EGVB) is one of the most common and serious complications of liver cirrhosis. Despite advances in diagnostic and treatment methods, the mortality rate of this condition remains high ranging from 15 to 20%. – In addition, recurrent bleeding is highly likely after management of EGVB, with a rebleeding rate of up to 17% within six weeks. Therefore, appropriate treatment of acute EGVB and prevention of variceal rebleeding are crucial for patients with liver cirrhosis. In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in regard to treatment strategies for EGVB. Traditional treatment methods include drug therapy, endoscopic hemostasis, interventional radiology, and surgical treatment. The current first-line treatment modalities for acute variceal bleeding include nonselective beta-blockers, vasoactive agents, antibiotics, and endoscopic therapies. – In particular, endoscopic treatment is currently the preferred approach for EGVB and is widely favored by patients owing to its minimally invasive nature. For persistent esophageal variceal bleeding that continues despite medical or endoscopic therapy, urgent rescue treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be considered. Although studies have demonstrated that TIPS is effective in preventing rebleeding, it has a higher incidence of postoperative hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and stent stenosis than that of other treatment methods, with no significant benefit in improving patient survival. – Many studies have compared different treatment methods for acute variceal bleeding. For example, in a randomized controlled study (RCT) by Garg et al. endoscopic band ligation plus low-dose sclerotherapy significantly reduced complications and rebleeding rates compared with endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy alone (3% vs 20% and 3% vs 16%, respectively). In another RCT conducted by Liu et al. emergency endoscopic ligation combined with octreotide had lower costs, higher efficacy, and higher safety than the use of octreotide alone for treating acute esophageal variceal bleeding. These studies aimed to investigate emergency hemostasis treatment after EGVB; however, owing to the persistent presence of portal hypertension, varicose veins can recur, leading to a high risk of rebleeding and compromising long-term treatment effectiveness. Consequently, sequential endoscopic therapy has attracted much attention in the search for more effective treatment options.

The combination of vasoactive agents with endoscopic treatment is more effective for hemostasis than using either alone. Vasoactive agents (ie, vasopressin, somatostatin or octreotide) should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected with a bolus (only somatostatin, octreotide) followed by continuous infusion (all agents) for duration 3–5 days, except vasopressin which should only be given for 24 hours. Consider infusion of erythromycin (250 mg given over 20–30 min) or metoclopramide as a promotility agent prior to endoscopy to clear gastric contents and assist with visualization.

Patients with UGIB in the setting of DC should be considered for endoscopy within 12 hours. Balloon tamponade as a bridge to TIPS should be considered as rescue therapy for patients with refractory variceal UGIB.

### Risk of rebleeding from gastroesophageal varices after initial treatment with cyanoacrylate; a systematic review and pooled analysis [^1123oHT3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of portal hypertension which in turn, leads to portal hypertension and gastrointestinal varices. Up to 17% of liver cirrhosis patients will develop esophageal varices, while 15% will develop gastric varices. Up to 30%, gastroesophageal varices will bleed within 2 years. Bleeding from varices is one among gastrointestinal emergencies that account for the majority of mortalities and morbidities among portal hypertension patients despite the cause. About 50 to 80% of patients who survive the first episode of variceal hemorrhage will have a recurrent early or late rebleeding episode. Up to 20% of patients with a rebleeding episode will not survive.

From older literature, half of the variceal hemorrhages would stop spontaneously however, the risk of rebleeding and mortality increases significantly. Current studies, however, report that in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh of class C or with hepatic venous pressure of higher than 20 mm Hg are less likely to spontaneous stoppage of bleeding. These patients would require interventional hemostatic measures with pharmacological drugs such as octreotide, somatostatin and beta blockers; endoscopic sclerotherapy, band ligation, or tissue adhesives injection; and/or shunting by surgery or by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to achieve hemostasis. A selective combination of these approaches has also been reported. Different hemostatic approaches differ in terms of their success rates in achieving hemostasis, preventing rebleeding, and reducing mortality and morbidity. With advancing technology, each approach has evolved, and tissue adhesives have increasingly being used as the first line of therapy during the last decades.

M-H, Mantel-Haenszel; CI, confidence interval

In terms of trends, prior to the sensitivity analysis there were statistically insignificant trends towards increased rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality in the longer vasoactive duration group who underwent BL. Octreotide and somatostatin both had similar trends of increased rebleeding within 5 days associated with the longer treatment durations (Fig. 2A), with only 1 study pooled on each, whereas shortening terlipressin had no notable trend and more studies were pooled. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for all 14 studies, which revealed that 11 studies had some risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis, excluding studies with high CPCC distributions, revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations in patients who underwent BL. Conversely, including only studies with high-risk variceal features or high CPCC distribution revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding and a trend towards greater mortality due to rebleeding at the EP.

### Treatment for bleeding oesophageal varices in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^116ApoeA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with liver cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed within about one to three years after diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, including, among others, endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, and balloon tamponade. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the individual and relative benefits and harms of these treatments.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis, through a network meta-analysis; and to generate rankings of the different treatments for acute bleeding oesophageal varices, according to their benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until 17 December 2019, to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in people with cirrhosis and acute bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Selection Criteria

We included only RCTs (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and acutely bleeding oesophageal varices. We excluded RCTs in which participants had bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those in whom initial haemostasis was achieved before inclusion into the trial, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS software, using Bayesian methods, and calculated the differences in treatments using odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed also the direct comparisons from RCTs using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included a total of 52 RCTs (4580 participants) in the review. Forty-eight trials (4042 participants) were included in one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those with and without a previous history of bleeding. We included outcomes assessed up to six weeks. All trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 19 interventions were compared in the trials (sclerotherapy, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues, variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogues plus variceal band ligation, nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, no active intervention, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade plus somatostatin analogues, balloon tamponade plus vasopressin analogues, variceal band ligation plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus variceal band ligation, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and sclerotherapy plus vasopressin analogues). We have reported the effect estimates for the primary and secondary outcomes when there was evidence of differences between the interventions against the reference treatment of sclerotherapy, but reported the other results of the primary and secondary outcomes versus the reference treatment of sclerotherapy without the effect estimates when there was no evidence of differences in order to provide a concise summary of the results. Overall, 15.8% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment of sclerotherapy (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) died during the follow-up periods, which ranged from three days to six weeks. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.57, 95% CrI 1.04 to 2.41; network estimate; direct comparison: 4 trials; 353 participants) and vasopressin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.70, 95% CrI 1.13 to 2.62; network estimate; direct comparison: 2 trials; 438 participants). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, a higher proportion of people receiving balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy had more serious adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 4.23, 95% CrI 1.22 to 17.80; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 60 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, people receiving vasopressin analogues alone and those receiving variceal band ligation had fewer adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (rate ratio 0.59, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.96; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 219 participants; and rate ratio 0.40, 95% CrI 0.21 to 0.74; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 77 participants; respectively). Based on low-certainty evidence, the proportion of people who developed symptomatic rebleed was smaller in people who received sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.94; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 105 participants). The evidence suggests considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons where sclerotherapy was the control intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate-certainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone and vasopressin analogues alone (with supportive therapy) probably result in increased mortality, compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, vasopressin analogues alone and band ligation alone probably result in fewer adverse events compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on low-certainty evidence, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy may result in large increases in serious adverse events compared to sclerotherapy. Based on low-certainty evidence, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues may result in large decreases in symptomatic rebleed compared to sclerotherapy. In the remaining comparisons, the evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the interventions, compared to sclerotherapy.

### Comparison of 2 days versus 5 days of octreotide infusion along with endoscopic therapy in preventing early rebleed from esophageal varices: a randomized clinical study [^115iJVV3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Variceal bleeding is a medical emergency with 20% mortality at 6 weeks. The role of vasoactive agents in achieving hemostasis and preventing rebleeding has been well documented. The optimal duration of these agents has not been well established. There are no previous studies yielding the exact duration of octreotide to be administered to prevent rebleed and mortality from esophageal varices. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of combination therapy (octreotide and endoscopy), the exact duration of octreotide infusion, its cost-effectiveness, and the outcome in terms of rebleed and mortality.

Patients and Methods

This was a randomized clinical trial including 124 patients with acute variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic therapy; they were assigned randomly to 2 days (n = 62) and 5 days (n = 58) of continuous octreotide infusion (50μg/kg). Early rebleeding (within 42 days of index bleed according to Baveno IV consensus guidelines), transfusion requirement, and mortality were assessed.

Results

The study had predominantly male patients, average age 47 years. Among the patients in the 2-day group, 3 (4.8%) showed early rebleed versus 5 (8.6%) in the 5-day group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Among the patients in the 2-day group, one patient died after 3 weeks and all the patients in the 5-day group survived till 6 weeks on follow-up, and the survival rates were comparable (P > 0.05). The treatment in the 5-day group was 2.5 times costlier than that for the 2-day group as shown by a cost-wise analysis.

Conclusion

Two days of octreotide infusion following endoscopic therapy is sufficient and as efficacious as 5 days of infusion in preventing early rebleed, with reasonably better cost-effectiveness.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^1141sshX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis

Guidance Statement 1. Terlipressin is recommended for the treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is one of serious complications of liver cirrhosis, and gastroesophageal varices are the most common source of gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. Terlipressin has been recommended as the first-line treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. – In 1990, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for the first time explored the role of terlipressin for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Sixty patients were assigned to terlipressin (n = 29) and placebo (n = 31) groups. The rate of control bleeding was significantly higher in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving placebo (90% versus 59%, p < 0.01). Since then, several studies have also confirmed the efficacy of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding. Recently, a meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 3344 cases compared the efficacy and safety of terlipressin versus placebo, pituitrin, somatostatin, octreotide, endoscopic therapy, or balloon tamponade for the management of acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Patients receiving terlipressin had a significantly higher rate of control bleeding and a lower mortality than those receiving placebo, but were not significantly different from those receiving pituitrin, somatostatin, or octreotide. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving pituitrin [odds ratio (OR) R = 0.15, p = 0.02], but higher than those receiving somatostatin (OR = 2.44, p = 0.04). Terlipressin alone had significantly higher 5-day treatment failure than endoscopic variceal ligation plus terlipressin (OR = 14.46, p = 0.01). Terlipressin group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than balloon tamponade group (OR = 0.05, p < 0.01). In addition, terlipressin in combination with octreotide or somatostatin did not further reduce portal pressure. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that the dosage of terlipressin is 2 mg/4 h by intravenous boluses for 2–5 days. Notably, recent evidence suggested that continuous infusion of terlipressin could reduce portal pressure stably and increase treatment success rate. Considering the use of terlipressin in our clinical practice, we recommend that the initial dosage of terlipressin is 1–2 mg/4 h by slowly intravenous boluses (> 1 min) or continuously intravenous infusion and that the maintenance dosage is 1–2 mg/6 h by continuously intravenous infusion. Generally, the maximum daily dosage is 120–150 μg/kg, and its duration is 3–5 days. Certainly, the dosage and duration of terlipressin can be adjusted according to the severity of variceal bleeding and patients' conditions.

### Updated strategies in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage [^1134phDW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yJm1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, our subgroup analysis revealed that a shorter duration of vasoactive therapy combined with sclerotherapy was associated with more rebleeding and greater mortality in the extended period (EP). This makes intuitive sense, as sclerotherapy has been associated with acute rises in portal pressures lasting for 5 days, which may increase rebleeding risk; thus, longer vasoactive durations for up to 5 days to potentially counteract that effect should remain the standard of care whenever sclerotherapy is performed.

Finally, our sensitivity analysis by liver disease and variceal bleeding severity showed a trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer vasoactive durations in cases with less severity, and a trend for less 5-day rebleeding and lower mortality at the EP associated with longer durations in cases with higher severity. The trend that shortening durations alongside BL decreases rebleeding in patients with less severe bleeding, particularly with octreotide and somatostatin, but increases rebleeding in severe liver disease or variceal bleeding cases, warrants a cautious approach to shortening vasoactive durations in severe EVB, pending further investigation. It should be noted that the lower levels of rebleeding in shorter durations were more prevalent in the octreotide and somatostatin subgroups, which share similar mechanisms of action. Data suggest that longer durations of octreotide lead to tachyphylaxis and less sustained drops in portal pressures compared to terlipressin, although how this relates back to greater rebleeding is unclear. Additionally, the trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations of octreotide/somatostatin, but not terlipressin, could just be due to the limited sample size for the former drugs.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension: much to learn, much to explore [^114VCAzX]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The newer diagnostic and therapeutic options continue to evolve and important developments have been made in the field of variceal bleeding and portal hypertension. A meeting was held at Baveno to update consensus on different terminologies in relation to portal hypertension. beta-blockers continue to be the mainstay for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is fast emerging as a strong contender. The role of vasoactive drugs in the management of variceal bleeding was assessed. Octreotide and terlipressin were shown to be as effective as sclerotherapy in achieving initial hemostasis, and octreotide was shown to be safe and efficacious in the prevention of rebleeding. EVL was superior to endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) for obliteration of esophageal varices. Sequential and simultaneous ligation and sclerotherapy were more effective than ligation alone, in reducing the recurrence rate after variceal obliteration. For gastric varices, cyanoacrylate glue continues to be the first line of treatment, and band ligation is being assessed further. Bleeding ectopic varices were dealt by appropriate endoscopic means. Endosonography has developed strongly in the assessment of variceal eradication and prediction of variceal recurrence. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) significantly reduces rebleeding rates compared to EVL.

### Somatostatin, somatostatin analogues and other vasoactive drugs in the treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices [^115bEw51]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and its analogues have been compared with a variety of other treatments for the treatment of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Meta-analyses of studies comparing somatostatin or octreotide with vasopressin or terlipressin have shown that somatostatin is somewhat superior to vasopressin and equivalent to terlipressin in controlling bleeding and has significantly fewer side effects; no difference in mortality was observed. Octreotide was somewhat better than vasopressin and terlipressin in controlling bleeding, with similar mortality. Meta-analysis of trials comparing somatostatin or octreotide with endoscopic sclerotherapy shows that both drugs are equivalent to sclerotherapy for bleeding control, early rebleeding and survival. Complications are much less frequent with drug treatment. Nine trials have compared endoscopic therapy with therapeutic regimens combining endoscopic treatment with somatostatin, octreotide or vapreotide. Meta-analysis show that the combined regimens increase the 5 days bleeding control rate of endoscopic treatments by over 20%, although there is no difference in mortality. Comparisons of somatostatin and octreotide with combined regimens of sclerotherapy + somatostatin and sclerotherapy + octreotide have shown that the combined regimens were better than drug treatments alone in controlling bleeding and preventing early rebleeding, while complications were significantly less frequent with drug therapy.

Management strategies at the emergency department

The majority of the patients (71.5%) received intravenous fluid whilst at the ED (Mean volume: 1394.3 mls). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was given in 71.5% of patients, of which 38.6% had prior peptic ulcer disease (PUD) history. 19 (59.4%) of those with a high clinical Rockall score, i.e. ≥ 4 received high dose PPI (i.e. 80 mg) whereas 12(37.5%) of those with the high clinical Rockall score did not receive any PPI. A small proportion of patients (18.7 and 20.3%) received Octreotide and Tranexamic acid respectively. Less than half (10, 43.5%) of those receiving Octreotide had prior h/o esophageal varices. Amongst those with h/o esophageal varices (7, 41.2%) did not receive octreotide. A minority (8, 18.6%) of those with a known history of liver disease received antibiotics in the ED. Nearly half (48.8%) of patients received blood transfusion, with 80% of them receiving 1 unit of blood. No patient received emergent endoscopy.

### No difference in mortality between terlipressin and somatostatin treatments in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding and renal functional impairment [^112xjvpN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal varices are common among patients with portal hypertension and, in particular, in cirrhotic patients–. Variceal bleeding is frequently a lethal complication of liver cirrhosis. A single episode of uncontrolled variceal bleeding results in immediate death in 5–8% of patients and has a 6-week mortality rate for at least 20% of patients. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is recommended as the first-choice intervention for esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) in cirrhotic patients, although sclerotherapy may be used if ligation is technically difficult.

If variceal hemorrhage is suspected, pharmacologic therapy with vasoactive agents should be started as soon as possible and continued for 3–5 days after endoscopic treatment. Vasoactive drugs (e.g. vasopressin, somatostatin, terlipressin, and octreotide) play a role in controlling variceal bleeding by reducing portal blood flow and portal pressure. Allegedly, clinicians have no preference when selecting one of these vasoactive drugs because of their equal efficacies–.

Cirrhotic patients with renal functional impairment (RFI) belong to a special subgroup of patients presenting with particularly poor clinical outcomes. Vasoconstriction drugs, particularly terlipressin, combined with albumin, have been effective in the management of hepatorenal syndromes. Terlipressin therapy may be more beneficial in improving renal function and reduce mortality than either albumin alone or no therapy. However, the role of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with EVB and RFI has yet to be explored.

To identify the effects of vasoactive agents on EVB-related mortality in cirrhotic patients with RFI, Taiwan's nationwide population-based dataset was used for evaluation. In addition, treatment outcomes following EVL were assessed to identify the clinical factors associated with mortality.

### Emergency sclerotherapy versus medical interventions for bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhotic patients [^114Bo6t5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency sclerotherapy is widely used as a first line therapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, although pharmacological treatment may stop bleeding in the majority of patients.

Objectives

To assess whether emergency sclerotherapy is superior to pharmacological treatment for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Electronic and manual searches were combined until April 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive treatments (vasopressin (plus minus nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers identified eligible trials and extracted data. Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, rebleeding before other elective treatments, 42-day rebleeding, mortality before other elective treatments, 42-day mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events. Data were analysed by a random effects model according to the vasoactive treatment. Sensitivity analyses included combined analysis of all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, fixed effects model analyses, type of publication, methodological quality, and adequacy of generation of the randomisation list and of allocation concealment.

Main Results

Twelve trials including 1146 patients (pts) were identified. One trial compared sclerotherapy with vasopressin, one with terlipressin, four with somatostatin, and six with octreotide. No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcomes. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were: failure to control bleeding (11 RCTs, 977 pts) -0.03 (-0.07 to 0.01); five-day failure rate (7 RCTs, 759 pts) -0.05 (-0.12 to 0.01); rebleeding (11 RCTs, 1082 pts) -0.01(-0.06 to 0.04); rebleeding before other elective treatments (9 RCTs, 975 pts) -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.03); mortality (12 RCTs, 1146 pts) -0.04 (-0.08 to 0.00); mortality before other elective treatments (5 RCTs, 474 pts) -0.02 (-0.07 to 0.04); transfused blood units (7 RCTs, 793 pts) (weighted mean difference) -0.17 (-0.52 to 0.19). Adverse events (11 RCTs, 1082 pts) and serious adverse events (5 RCTs, 602 pts) were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy: risk differences 0.08 (0.02 to 0.14) and 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08), respectively. Results were consistent across all the other sensitivity analyses.

Reviewer's Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs.

### Multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing different schedules of somatostatin in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding [^113FjrFK]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The dose of somatostatin used for variceal bleeding (250 microg/h) is lower than that proven to effectively decrease portal pressure and azygos blood flow (500 microg/h). Moreover, i.v. somatostatin boluses have greater effects than continuous infusions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether higher doses of somatostatin and repeated boluses may increase its efficacy in controlling variceal bleeding.

Methods

A total of 174 patients with acute variceal bleeding were randomized to receive for 48 h: (A) one 250 microg bolus +250 microg/h infusion; (B) three 250 microg boluses +250 microg/h infusion; (C) three 250 microg boluses +500 microg/h infusion.

Results

The three schedules of somatostatin were equally effective in controlling variceal bleeding (73, 75 and 81%, respectively, NS). Multivariate analysis showed active bleeding at endoscopy (n = 75) as the only predictor of failure to control bleeding. In these patients, the 500 microg/h infusion dose achieved a higher rate of control of bleeding (82 vs. 60%, P < 0.05), less transfusions (3.7 ± 2.7 vs. 2.5 ± 2.3 UU, P = 0.07) and better survival (93 vs. 70%, P < 0.05) than schedules A/B.

Conclusions

Somatostatin is highly effective in controlling variceal bleeding. Patients with active bleeding at emergency endoscopy may benefit from higher doses of somatostatin infusion.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117TF9Cu]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Management of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding — NSBBs may be used for primary or secondary variceal bleeding prophylaxis, with propranolol favored in pregnancy, and EVL is preferred for medium or large esophageal varices and should continue until obliteration of varices. For active variceal hemorrhage, immediate resuscitation and stabilization of the mother and emergent endoscopic therapy are required; octreotide or somatostatin should also be initiated, but terlipressin should be avoided because it can cause uterine contractions and reduce uterine blood flow. For antibiotic prophylaxis in acute variceal bleeding, cephalosporins are preferred due to favorable pregnancy and lactation safety data. Options for recurrent or gastric variceal bleeding include cyanoacrylate with or without coiling depending on center expertise, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been used with success as rescue therapy for uncontrolled GEV bleeding and for decompression of abdominal wall varices before cesarean section when vaginal delivery was contraindicated. Secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding includes use of NSBBs and EVL, with the combination preferred.

### Variation in care for children with esophageal varices: a study of physicians', patients', and families' approaches and attitudes [^111vAaXP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Inadequate evidence to guide the management of children with esophageal varices may lead to variation in care and the provision of poor-quality care to some children. The aims of the study were to describe approaches taken by pediatric gastroenterologists for the management of esophageal varices in children, and to determine the attitudes of children, parents, and physicians toward screening endoscopy for identification of varices.

Methods

Canadian pediatric gastroenterologists and hepatologists were questioned about their approaches to screening for esophageal varices and therapy to prevent or treat variceal hemorrhage. Consecutive children with portal hypertension and their parents were surveyed about attitudes to screening endoscopy.

Results

Forty-seven of 72 (65%) physicians responded. Seventy percent of respondents screen for esophageal varices in selected children, most using endoscopy (77%). Fifty-eight percent of respondents who screen for varices would provide primary prophylactic treatment. Most would treat an acute variceal bleed with antibiotics, acid suppression, octreotide, and endoscopy within 24 hours (76%) and then secondary prophylaxis with endoscopic variceal ligation (96%) or β-blockers (28%). Among 29 families surveyed, 63% of parents and 50% of patients would agree to screening endoscopy to understand their risk of variceal bleeding and 67% if prophylactic therapy were available. Families were more concerned about the risk of endoscopic adverse events than were gastroenterologists.

Conclusions

Pediatric gastroenterologists vary in the care they provide for children at risk for esophageal varices and their attitudes toward the role of screening endoscopy differ from that of their patients. Further evidence is required to support practice guidelines that may reduce variation in care and thus improve its quality.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding: a single-center retrospective study [^112C64Sf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Timing of endoscopy was calculated according to the interval from the last presentation of AUGIB or the admission to endoscopy. Accordingly, eligible patients were divided into early and delayed endoscopy groups according to three different intervals, including < 12 h versus ≥ 12 h, < 24 h versus ≥ 24 h, and < 48 h versus ≥ 48 h.

AUGIB was defined as hematemesis or melena within 120 h before admission. Variceal bleeding was defined as: (1) the presence of active bleeding from varices on endoscopy; (2) signs of recent bleeding, such as white nipple; or (3) variceal bleeding would also be considered, if varices were the only lesion in the stomach, and blood was found in the stomach or endoscopy was performed 24 h after bleeding. Five-day failure to control bleeding was defined as the presence of any of the following within 5 days after endoscopy: (1) vomiting fresh blood or aspirating more than 100 mL fresh blood for patients with naso-gastric tube placement after 2 h of endoscopy; (2) reduction of 3 g/L hemoglobin without transfusion; or (3) death.

Management of AUGIB

Generally, the management of AUGIB is in accordance with the current practice guideline, which primarily includes fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, pharmacological treatment, and endoscopic treatment. Red blood cell transfusion would be given, if patients had a hemoglobin level of < 60–80 g/L, or they had active bleeding and were hemodynamically unstable. Pharmacological treatment included intravenous vasoactive drugs (terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) and high-dose proton pump inhibitors. Timing of endoscopy was decided at the discretion of attending physicians according to the patients' age, consciousness, comorbidities, and hemodynamics. Endoscopic treatment was performed by experienced endoscopists. Endoscopic variceal therapy includes endoscopic variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, and injection of tissue adhesive. Endoscopic variceal ligation was primarily employed for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding, sclerotherapy was considered when ligation was technically difficult or active variceal bleeding was observed on endoscopy, and injection of tissue adhesive was primarily used for the treatment of acute gastric variceal bleeding. Repeat endoscopy was often recommended 2–4 weeks after the first endoscopic variceal therapy, with additional endoscopic variceal treatment(s), if necessary. If endoscopy failed to control bleeding, patients would undergo surgery or interventional treatment.

### Emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhotic patients [^1116Umec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency sclerotherapy is still widely used as a first line therapy for variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, particularly when banding ligation is not available or feasible. However, pharmacological treatment may stop bleeding in the majority of these patients.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Search of trials was based on The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded through January 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs (vasopressin (with or without nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, rebleeding, mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events. Data were analysed by a random-effects model according to the vasoactive treatment. Sensitivity analyses included combined analysis of all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, type of publication, and risk of bias.

Main Results

Seventeen trials including 1817 patients were identified. Vasoactive drugs were vasopressin (one trial), terlipressin (one trial), somatostatin (five trials), and octreotide (ten trials). No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcome. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, the risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were failure to control bleeding -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), five-day failure rate -0.05 (-0.10 to 0.01), rebleeding 0.01 (-0.03 to 0.05), mortality (17 randomised trials, 1817 patients) -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), and transfused blood units (8 randomised trials, 849 patients) (weighted mean difference) -0.24 (-0.54 to 0.07). Adverse events 0.08 (0.03 to 0.14) and serious adverse events 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08) were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs. Vasoactive drugs may be safe and effective whenever endoscopic therapy is not promptly available and seems to be associated with less adverse events than emergency sclerotherapy. Other meta-analyses and guidelines advocate that combined vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy is superior to either intervention alone.

Regarding medical management for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to vasoactive agents, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to administer vasoconstrictors, such as terlipressin or somatostatin, in all patients with variceal hemorrhage, starting as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected and continuing until hemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Consider administering octreotide if terlipressin or somatostatin is unavailable.

### Pro / con debate: octreotide has an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin? [^1167PeBM]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Whether it is the primary reason for admission or a complication of critical illness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is commonly encountered in the intensive care unit. In this setting, in the absence of endoscopy, intensivists generally provide supportive care (transfusion of blood products) and acid suppression (such as proton pump inhibitors). More recently, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) has been used in such patients. However, its precise role in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not necessarily clear and the drug is associated with significant costs. In this issue of Critical Care, two expert teams debate the merits of using octreotide in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^112TBySt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^111wcWjs]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertension (PH) in pregnancy — AASLD guidance recommends that all patients with cirrhosis or noncirrhotic PH planning pregnancy undergo upper endoscopy within 1 year of conception; unscreened patients should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) early in the second trimester. Primary prophylaxis with NSBB or endoscopic band ligation (EBL) for medium and large varices are recommended in pregnant patients with preference for EBL in the presence of cherry red spots or red wale signs. In the setting of acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH), terlipressin should be avoided because of stimulation of uterine contraction, but somatostatin or octreotide may be used. Case series exist documenting utilization of band ligation and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for secondary prophylaxis or to control refractory variceal hemorrhage in pregnancy. Weak evidence suggests that carvedilol results in lesser fetal growth retardation in pregnancy.

### Octreotide for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^115gkiZN]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Studies of octreotide have not demonstrated a consistent benefit in efficacy or safety compared with conventional therapies. This study statistically pooled existing trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide for esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

Methods

We identified randomized trials of octreotide for variceal hemorrhage from computerized databases, scientific meeting abstracts, and the manufacturer of octreotide. Blinded reviewers abstracted the data, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Octreotide improved control of esophageal variceal hemorrhage compared with all alternative therapies combined (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.77); vasopressin/terlipressin (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.81); or no additional intervention/placebo (among patients that received initial sclerotherapy/banding before randomization) (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67). Octreotide had comparable efficacy to immediate sclerotherapy for control of bleeding (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.55–1.62), fewer major complications than vasopressin/terlipessin (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.87), and a complication profile comparable to no intervention/placebo (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72–1.55). No specific alternative therapy demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Conclusions

These results favor octreotide over vasopressin/terlipressin in the control of esophageal variceal bleeding and suggest it is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration techniques. Trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of octreotide treatment.

### Endoscopic treatment versus endoscopic plus pharmacologic treatment for acute variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^114HgkYi]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Endoscopic therapy, involving either injection sclerosis or band ligation, is considered the intervention of first choice for acute variceal bleeding (AVB). Pharmacologic agents have also been shown to be highly effective in the control of the bleeding episode. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess whether vasoactive drugs may improve the efficacy of endoscopic therapy (injection sclerosis or band ligation) in the control of AVB and thus increase survival rates. Computer databases and scientific meeting abstracts from 1994 to 2001 were used to search for randomized trials that compared the combined use of endoscopic and drug therapy with endoscopic therapy alone in the control of AVB. Eight trials involving 939 patients fulfilled the selection criteria and the following evaluated by standard meta-analysis methods: initial hemostasis, 5-day hemostasis, 5-day mortality, and adverse events. Combined treatment improved initial control of bleeding (relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.23), and 5-day hemostasis (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18–1.39), with numbers of patients needed to treat (NNT) of 8 and 5, respectively. The difference in favor of combined treatment remained significant when trials that used drugs other than octreotide or that included a low proportion of alcoholic patients (< 40%) or high-risk cirrhotic patients (< 35%) were excluded. Mortality was not significantly decreased by combined therapy (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.45–1.18). Severe adverse events were similar in both groups. In conclusion, in patients with AVB, pharmacologic agents improve the efficacy of endoscopic therapy to achieve initial control of bleeding and 5-day hemostasis, yet fail to affect mortality.

### Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices [^1166yHtb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Somatostatin and its derivatives are often used for emergency treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

Objectives

To study whether somatostatin or analogues improve survival or reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library were searched; last search in Febr 2004. Reference lists of articles, contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing somatostatin or analogues with placebo or no treatment in patients suspected of acute or recent bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

The effect variables extracted were: mortality, blood transfusions, use of balloon tamponade, initial haemostasis and rebleeding. Intention-to-treat analyses including all randomised patients were conducted; a random effects analysis was preferred if there was significant heterogeneity between the trials (P < 0.10). The trials were divided in two quality groups; the better trials had concealed allocation of patients and were double-blind.

Main Results

We included 20 trials (2518 patients). The drugs did not reduce mortality significantly (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.24, for the high-quality trials, and 0.79 for low-quality trials). Units of blood transfused were 0.7 (0.3 to 1.2) less with drugs in the high-quality trials and 1.5 (0.9 to 2.0) less in the low-quality trials. Number of patients failing initial haemostasis was reduced, relative risk 0.67 (0.53 to 0.86). Number of patients with rebleeding was not significantly reduced for the high-quality trials, relative risk 0.82 (0.45 to 1.49) while it was substantially reduced in the low-quality trials, relative risk 0.35 (0.18 to 0.67). Use of balloon tamponade was rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The effect corresponded to one half unit of blood saved per patient. It is doubtful whether this effect is worthwhile. The findings do not suggest a need for further placebo-controlled studies of the type reviewed here. A large placebo controlled trial enrolling thousands of patients is needed if one wishes to rule out the possibility that a worthwhile effect on mortality may have been overlooked.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^116iTGCd]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive drug regimens are detailed as follows. Octreotide (somatostatin analogue): 50 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 50 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Somatostatin: 250 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 250–500 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Terlipressin (vasopressin analogue): Initial 48 h: 2 mg IV every 4 h until bleeding is controlled; Maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 h; duration 2–5 d. Although terlipressin has been evaluated for AVH and is one of the standard regimens outside of the United States, the FDA label does not include this indication.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for acute variceal hemorrhage [^113BhHjk]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute variceal hemorrhage is life-threatening and requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective therapy. Transfusion of blood products, systemic therapy with vasopressin, octreotide, and selective beta-blockers and early endoscopic therapy are often effective; however, uncontrollable variceal hemorrhage is best treated with transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) creation. This procedure involves establishment of a direct pathway between the hepatic veins and the portal veins to decompress the portal venous hypertension that is the source of the patient's hemorrhage. The procedure is technically challenging, especially in critically ill patients, and has a mortality of 30%-50% in the emergency setting, but has greater than 90% effectiveness in controlling bleeding from gastroesophageal varices. In this review, we discuss the technical aspects of TIPS and briefly examine the results of TIPS in managing acute variceal hemorrhage.

### Octreotide infusion as a treatment for hepatic hydrothorax in a hospital-at-home program: case report from mayo clinic [^112n3nmN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, exerts its effects by inhibiting a broad range of peptide and regulatory hormones. It is used in the management of various endocrine and enteroendocrine conditions, including acromegaly, carcinoid syndrome, high-output fistulas, and refractory diarrhea associated with acute graft-versus-host disease, chemotherapy, or neuroendocrine tumors. Octreotide also inhibits the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis, leading to improved renal plasma flow and enhanced natriuresis. It is widely used in the management of variceal bleeding due to its potent vasoconstrictive effects on the splanchnic circulation and, along with midodrine, is employed in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. Given its ability to decrease systemic and portal vascular resistance while reducing splanchnic vasodilation and stimulating renal sodium excretion, octreotide has been explored as a potential adjunct therapy for HH. Reduced blood flow to the abdominal organs alleviates portal vein pressure and has been theorized to decrease the fluid accumulation precipitating HH. Despite its therapeutic utility, octreotide is associated with a range of adverse effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and transient elevations in liver enzymes. Although there are no absolute contraindications aside from hypersensitivity reactions, serious but less common complications have been reported. These include gallbladder sludge and cholelithiasis, cardiovascular conduction disturbances ranging from sinus bradycardia to complete atrioventricular block, and various endocrine or exocrine disturbances related to hormone dysregulation. In addition, the development of tachyphylaxis has been observed in patients receiving octreotide for cirrhosis and portal hypertension, particularly in the setting of esophageal varices. This phenomenon is thought to result from rapid downregulation of somatostatin receptors; once receptor saturation occurs, further octreotide administration may offer limited or no additional therapeutic benefit, even at escalated doses, thereby potentially limiting its long-term efficacy in these populations. While its application in HH has been reported in case studies, no clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy in this context. –

### Lack of difference among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in the control of acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^113MNNYX]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasoactive drugs are recommended to be started as soon as possible in suspected variceal bleeding, even before diagnostic endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the therapeutic efficacies of the various vasoactive drugs used are comparable. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial was to characterize the effects of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when they are initiated before endoscopic treatment in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive early administration of terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide, followed by endoscopic treatment. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding were excluded after endoscopy. The primary endpoint was 5-day treatment success, defined as control of bleeding without rescue treatment, rebleeding, or mortality, with a noninferiority margin of 0.1. In total, 780 patients with variceal bleeding were enrolled: 261 in the terlipressin group; 259 in the somatostatin group; and 260 in the octreotide group. At the time of initial endoscopy, active bleeding was noted in 43.7%, 44.4%, and 43.5% of these patients, respectively (P = 0.748), and treatment success was achieved by day 5 in 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.8% (P = 0.636), with similar rates of control of bleeding without rescue treatment (89.7%, 87.6%, and 88.1%; P = 0.752), rebleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, and 4.4%; P = 0.739), or mortality (8.0%, 8.9%, and 8.8%; P = 0.929). The absolute values of the lower bound of confidence intervals for terlipressin versus somatostatin, terlilpressin versus octreotide, and octreotide versus somatostatin were 0.095, 0.090, and 0.065, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemostatic effects and safety did not differ significantly between terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide as adjuvants to endoscopic treatment in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

### Impact of timing of endoscopy on clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding: a monocentric retrospective study from Vietnam [^1121sigp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

Upon arrival at the emergency department with suspected variceal bleeding, emergency physicians consulted with the on-duty gastroenterologist to assess the feasibility of performing the endoscopic intervention. The procedure was generally carried out once the patient had been intensively resuscitated and their hemodynamics had been stabilized. The decision to proceed with endoscopy, as well as the timing, was based on the clinical evaluation of the on-duty gastroenterologist.

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is performed by an experienced endoscopist with at least 3 years of experience in therapeutic endoscopy, using advanced endoscopic systems, including the Olympus Elvis X1, CV 190, and CV 170, all featuring straight scopes and large working channels. The procedure also involves suction devices capable of holding multiple rubber bands for ligation.

Before the procedure, both the patient and their family were thoroughly informed about the endoscopy process, including its risks and benefits, and they signed a written consent form for the procedure.

In terms of treatment, all patients are managed according to current ESGE and Baveno VII guidelines. Adequate resuscitation with fluids and blood is initiated to ensure the proper tissue perfusion, along with prophylactic antibiotics and a vasoactive medicine with Octreotide (50 µg intravenous bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 50 µg/hour for 2–5 days) immediately upon admission. Blood transfusions are given when hemoglobin levels fall to ≤ 70 g/L, with the goal of maintaining levels between 7 and 9 g/dL.

Data collection

We identified cirrhosis patients with EVB by reviewing the electronic inpatient database of Da Nang Hospital during the study period. Patient eligibility for inclusion was determined through a comprehensive evaluation, including medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and endoscopic results during hospitalisation. If a patient was hospitalised multiple times for variceal bleeding during the study period, only the first admission was included. We gathered information on patient demographics, medical history, comorbidities, and key laboratory results recorded at the time of admission. The Child-Pugh score, MELD score, MELD-Na, and Glasgow-Blatchford score were calculated based on the patient's medical records.

MELD score = 9.57 × loge (creatinine) + 3.78 × loge (total bilirubin) + 11.2 × loge (INR) + 6.43.

MELD-Na = MELD–Na – [0.025 × MELD × (140-Na)] + 140 with parameters Na < 125 calculated as 125 and Na > 140 calculated at 140.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding [^112Gef3b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension bleeding is a common and serious complication of cirrhosis. All patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopy and be evaluated for possible causes of current or future portal hypertensive bleeding. Possible causes of bleeding include esophageal varices, gastric varices, and PHG. Patients with esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding should be treated with nonselective beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. HVPG measurements represent the optimal way to monitor the success of pharmacologic therapy. EVL may be used in those with high-risk varices who do not tolerate beta-blockers. When active bleeding develops, simultaneous and coordinated attention must be given to hemodynamic resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications, and active control of bleeding. In cases of acute esophageal variceal (Fig. 5) and PHG bleeding, terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide should be started. Endoscopic treatment is provided for those with bleeding esophageal varices. If first-line therapy fails, TIPS or surgery may need to be performed. Unlike esophageal variceal or PHG bleeding, there is no established optimal treatment for gastric variceal bleeding. Individual and specific treatment modalities for acute gastric variceal bleeding must be calculated carefully after considering side effects.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^113x2oNu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage

Perioperative volume overload can increase portal pressure and precipitate bleeding from esophageal varices. Other possible contributing factors include postoperative hepatic dysfunction and portal venous thrombosis. Variceal hemorrhage represents a medical emergency to be managed in the intensive care unit.

Resuscitative measures to preserve the respiratory and circulatory systems should be promptly initiated. A restrictive transfusion strategy aiming at hemoglobin levels of 7–9 g/dl has been associated with decreased re-bleeding and mortality rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone for up to 7 days is indicated to address the increased risk of bacterial infections and also to decrease the risk of re-bleeding and mortality. Infusion of vasoactive agents (somatostatin, terlipressin, and octreotide) for 2 to 5 days has been associated with lower mortality and transfusion requirements.

An urgent endoscopy should be completed no longer than 12 h from presentation. Elastic band ligation represents the first-line endoscopic intervention for esophageal varices, but sclerotherapy is an excellent alternative for difficult cases. Elastic band ligation has proven more effective than sclerotherapy in terms of the number of required sessions, as well as re-bleeding and mortality rates. A non-specific beta-blocker (propranolol or nadolol) is indicated after the vasoactive infusion is discontinued.

Balloon tamponade is reserved for temporary control of ongoing variceal bleeding while definitive therapy is being arranged. TIPS should be considered pre-emptively in high-risk patients, or in refractory or recurrent hemorrhage, as improved mortality rates have been observed.

Table 3 summarizes current recommendations for the management of hemorrhage from esophageal varices.

Table 3
Management of variceal hemorrhage

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Coagulation disorders of cirrhosis confer an increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage. As previously indicated, conventional coagulation tests do not reflect these risks, and an increased INR is not necessarily protective for thromboembolic events. Although detailed guidelines remain unavailable, thromboprophylaxis is recommended in most patients, and certainly in high-risk situations.

### Treatment of acute variceal bleeding [^114KbKx9]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The management of variceal bleeding remains a clinical challenge with a high mortality. Standardisation in supportive and new therapeutic treatments seems to have improved survival within the last 25 years. Although overall survival has improved in recent years, mortality is still closely related to failure to control initial bleeding or early re-bleeding occurring in up to 30–40% of patients. Initial procedures are to secure and protect the airway, and administer volume replacement to stabilize the patient. Treatment with vasoactive drugs should be started as soon as possible, since a reduction in portal pressure is associated with a better control of bleeding and may facilitate later endoscopic procedures. Vasopressin and its analogues Terlipressin and somatostatin and analogues are the two types of medicine, which has been evaluated. In meta-analysis, only Terlipressin have demonstrated effects on control of bleeding and on mortality. Somatostatin and its analogues improve control of bleeding, but show in meta-analysis no effects on mortality. Approximately 20% of patients with variceal bleeding will suffer from an infection, when they are hospitalized. Invasive procedures will further increase the risk of bacterial infections. Meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing antibiotics with placebo demonstrates that antibiotic prophylaxis improves survival with 9% (p < 0.004). Quinolones or intravenous cephalosporins should be preferred. Early endoscopy should be performed in patients with major bleeding. Endoscopic therapy increases control of bleeding and decreases the risks of rebleeding and mortality. Ligation is probably more effective than sclerotherapy with fewer complications and should therefore be preferred, if possible. In case of gastric variceal bleeding, tissue adhesives should be used.

In Conclusion

Improvements in resuscitation and prevention of complications have together with introduction of vasoactive drugs and refinement of endoscopic therapy majorily changed the prognosis of the patient presenting with variceal bleeding.

### Meta-analysis: efficacy of therapeutic regimens in ongoing variceal bleeding [^1148XoJo]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Variceal bleeding is a major cause of mortality in liver cirrhosis. Therapeutic options include medical (vasoconstrictive/vasoactive drugs) and endoscopic (sclerotherapy/ligation) treatments. Most studies evaluating acute esophageal bleeding have included patients with both ongoing and recent bleeding. Therefore therapeutic efficacy in ongoing bleeding may not have been adequately determined in these studies. A meta-analysis was performed for two reasons: first to compare directly the various treatments in the case of ongoing bleeding, as this would not be accomplished by a single trial, and secondly, to determine the success rates of each treatment option based on a larger number of patients.

Methods

An extensive Medline search identified 13 randomized controlled trials with precise statements of the number of patients with ongoing bleeding and their clinical outcomes. All studies followed a similar design and a Q test excluded heterogeneity of the studies. Data were pooled and cumulative success rates were calculated.

Results

Ligation appeared to be the most effective treatment (91.0%, 95% CI 82.4–96.3%); it was significantly more successful than vasoconstrictive treatment (vasopressin/terlipressin 68.7%, 61.7–75.2%; P < 0.002, chi-squared-test) or vasoactive treatment (somatostatin/octreotide, 75.9%, 68.1–82.6%; P < 0.02) treatment, but was not statistically better than sclerotherapy (81.1%, 71.7–88.4%). The latter therapy was not statistically superior to medical treatment options. Calculations of estimated true effects, which take into account the weight of each study, rendered similar results.

Conclusion

Ligation is the most effective treatment option. No significant difference was found between the efficacy of sclerotherapy and treatment with somatostatin or octreotide.

### Terlipressin vs. octreotide in bleeding esophageal varices as an adjuvant therapy with endoscopic band ligation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^116ba79t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data are scarce on the head-to-head efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic management of variceal bleed. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of terlipressin with octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic variceal band ligation in patients with esophageal variceal bleeding.

Methods

Cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleed were randomized on admission to receive terlipressin (group A) or octreotide (group B) along with the placebo in the other arm in a double-blind fashion. The two groups were compared for efficacy, safety, overall survival, and length of hospital stay. "Control of variceal bleed" was the measure of efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide. Factors predicting length of stay were also assessed.

Results

A total of 324 patients were enrolled; 163 in the terlipressin group (group A) and 161 in the octreotide group (group B). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable for age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, hemoglobin at presentation, and Child-Pugh class, except that active bleed was seen during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the time of enrollment in 26 (16%) and 41 (25.5%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.034). Overall sixteen patients died (three failure to control bleed and thirteen from causes other than variceal bleed); nine in group A (5.5%) and seven (4.3%) in group B (P = 0.626). In the intention to treat analysis, "control of variceal bleed" was noted in 305 patients (94.13%); 151 (92.63%) patients in group A and 154 (95.6%) patients in group B (confidence interval: 0.219–1.492). Packed cell transfusions in group A were 3.7 ± 2.3 units, whereas in group B there were 3.9 ± 2.5 units (P = 0.273). Length of hospital stay in groups A and B was 108.40 ± 34.81 and 126.39 ± 47.45 h, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). No cardiovascular side effects were observed in either group. High pulse, low hemoglobin, prothrombin time, blood in nasogastric aspirate, and portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) were predictors of prolonged hospital stay.

Conclusions

The efficacy of terlipressin was not inferior to octreotide as an adjuvant therapy for the control of esophageal variceal bleed and in-hospital survival. The length of hospital stay in the terlipressin group was significantly shorter but not of any clinical importance. The predictors of prolonged hospital stay were low hemoglobin, high pulse, prolonged prothrombin time, blood at nasogastric aspirate, and PSE.

### Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices [^1135Gpqv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Somatostatin and its derivatives are sometimes used for emergency treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

Objectives

To study whether somatostatin or its analogues improve survival or reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

Search Strategy

PubMed and The Cochrane Library were searched (November 2007). Reference lists of publications, contacts with authors.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing somatostatin or analogues with placebo or no treatment in patients suspected of acute or recent bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcome measures extracted were: mortality, blood transfusions, use of balloon tamponade, initial haemostasis and rebleeding. Intention-to-treat analyses including all randomised patients were conducted if possible; a random-effects analysis was preferred if there was significant heterogeneity between the trials (P < 0.10). The trials were divided in two groups: trials with a low risk of bias, which had concealed allocation of patients and were double-blind, and other trials.

Main Results

We included 21 trials (2588 patients). The drugs did not reduce mortality significantly (relative risk 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.25, for the trials with a low risk of bias, and 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01, for the other trials). Units of blood transfused were 0.7 (0.2 to 1.1) less with drugs in the trials with a low risk of bias and 1.5 (0.9 to 2.0) less in the other trials. Number of patients failing initial haemostasis was reduced, relative risk 0.68 (0.54 to 0.87). Number of patients with rebleeding was not significantly reduced for the trials with a low risk of bias, relative risk 0.84 (0.52 to 1.37) while it was substantially reduced in the other trials, relative risk 0.36 (0.19 to 0.68). Use of balloon tamponade was rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The need for blood transfusions corresponded to one half unit of blood saved per patient. It is doubtful whether this effect is worthwhile. The findings do not suggest a need for further placebo-controlled trials of the type reviewed here. A large placebo controlled trial enrolling thousands of patients is needed if one wishes to rule out the possibility that a worthwhile effect on mortality might have been overlooked.

### Beyond the scope and the glue: update on evaluation and management of gastric varices [^111ymwNF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis

On diagnostic endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding is confirmed in the presence of active bleeding from a visualized varix, presence of adherent clot or stigmata of recent haemorrhage over the GV and recurrent bleeding in a patient with PH and presence of GV in the absence of other identifiable sources of bleeding.

The general measures for initial optimization of clinical status to prevent further deterioration due to acute gastric variceal bleeding are similar to those followed in esophageal variceal bleeding. This includes airway protection through endotracheal intubation to prevent aspiration, maintaining minimum systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg for performing urgent diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy and the judicious use of packed red cells for target hemoglobin levels between 7 and 8 g/dL (21% haematocrit). Volume expansion and coagulation correction using fresh frozen plasma or plasma expanders lead to severe adverse clinical events in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding and must be avoided. A conventional dose of two fresh frozen plasma units can only replace 10% of the clotting factors. Large volume coagulation correction can lead to worsening PH, sepsis, sinister systemic immunomodulation, and rebleeding. In cirrhosis, a minimum platelet count 56,000/mL corresponds to adequate thrombin generation and is the ideal target for endoscopic interventions. Similarly, maintaining fibrinogen level > 120 mg/dL also improves haemostatic effects. Although the use of vasoactive agents for the reduction in portal pressure and control of rebleeding specific to gastric variceal bleeding is unavailable in literature, the same line of supportive therapy as for esophageal variceal bleeding, is currently recommended. Wang et al. in their systematic review and meta-analysis showed that there was no difference between vasopressin/terlipressin and somatostatin/octreotide in the prevention of re-bleeding after the initial treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Antibiotic prophylaxis, lactulose for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy along with other supportive measures that include varying degrees of organ support depending on the severity of systemic dysfunction is mandated in GV bleed. In a patient with active bleeding that preclude endoscopic treatment, temporizing measures such as intragastric balloon tamponade can be utilized. These devices can only be placed for a maximum of 24 h within which definitive treatment has to be carried out. Given its large volume capacity, a Linton-Nachlas tube is considered ideal for gastric variceal bleeding.

### Emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: a cochrane meta-analysis [^113keCEE]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Emergency sclerotherapy is used as a first-line therapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, although pharmacologic treatment stops bleeding in most patients. We performed a meta-analysis comparing emergency sclerotherapy with pharmacologic treatment.

Methods

MEDLINE (1968–2002), EMBASE (1986–2002), and the Cochrane Library (2002;4) were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin (± nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis. Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, rebleeding, blood transfusions, adverse events, and mortality.

Results

Fifteen trials were identified. Sclerotherapy was not superior to terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide for any outcome and to vasopressin for rebleeding, blood transfusions, death, and adverse events; it was superior to vasopressin for the control of bleeding in a single trial flawed by a potential detection bias. Sclerotherapy was associated with significantly more adverse events than somatostatin. In a predefined sensitivity analysis, combining all of the trials irrespective of the control treatment, risk differences (sclerotherapy minus control) and confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: failure to control bleeding, -0.03 (-0.06 to 0.01); mortality, -0.035 (-0.07 to 0.008); adverse events, 0.08 (0.02 to 0.14). Mortality risk difference was -0.01 (-0.07 to 0.04) in good-quality trials and -0.08 (-0.14 to -0.02) in poor-quality trials.

Conclusions

Available evidence does not support emergency sclerotherapy as the first-line treatment of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis when compared with vasoactive drugs, which control bleeding in 83% of patients. Therefore, endoscopic therapy might be added only in pharmacologic treatment failures.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — epidemiology, severity markers, progression, and management: Several clinical grading systems have been proposed to identify features associated with high or low risk of complications, including the New Italian Endoscopic Club (NIEC) and Baveno III systems. Consensus among grading systems is that intramucosal hemorrhaging signs (cherry red spots, black-brown spots, or red point lesions) differentiate severe from mild PHG and that concomitant gastric antral vascular ectasia confers higher risk of hemorrhage. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, prevalence ranges from 49% to 80%, lower in those without varices (11%) or with small varices (35%) relative to those with medium or large varices (80%–97%), and development usually requires the presence of CSPH. Longitudinally, progression is frequent and regression rare; for example, in the HALT-C study, 97/170 (57%) without PHG developed PHG and 115/174 (66%) with baseline PHG worsened over 4 years of clinical follow-up. Acute bleeding is uncommon at 2.5%–5% and often ceases spontaneously in over half of cases; low quality data support intravenous octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin as safe initial therapy. Acute administration of NSBBs reduces gastric hyperemia and may attenuate acute PHG bleeding; prospective studies suggest a potential prophylactic role of NSBBs for reduction of first or recurrent acute PHG bleeding after exclusion of Helicobacter pylori. Chronic blood loss is typically defined as a 2 g/dL hemoglobin reduction over a 6‑month interval and is present in up to 4%–12% of cases; an RCT showed a clear benefit from propranolol in preventing recurrent bleeding, with additional nonrandomized data for argon plasma coagulation and case series describing hemostatic spray and high rates of bleeding control with portosystemic decompression.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UCxYn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) spans 2–5 days. Prior meta-analyses of randomized trials include only a few studies that compared short vs. long vasoactive drug durations approximating this time range, including older management techniques, and only assessed variceal rebleeding at 5 days. We identified several additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing rebleeding at various durations, with updated management of EVB.

Methods

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of shortening the vasoactive drug duration by 48–72 h. The primary outcome was rebleeding within 5 days. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality within 4–6 weeks (extended period) with subgroup analysis by vasoactive drug and type of endoscopic therapy. Length of stay, blood transfusion requirements and terlipressin-related adverse events were additional secondary outcomes.

Results

Our comprehensive search strategy and screening process yielded 14 RCTs with 1060 patients (75.1% male): 7 trials used terlipressin, 4 octreotide, and 3 somatostatin. Shortened durations combined with band ligation led to similar rebleeding, with a trend towards less rebleeding when populations with more severe liver disease were excluded. There was greater rebleeding and mortality over an extended period when shorter durations were combined with sclerotherapy. Longer durations were associated with a longer hospital stay and, for terlipressin, more adverse events.

Conclusions

Shorter vasoactive drug durations combined with band ligation in selected populations appear safe. Higher powered RCTs are needed, involving patients with different degrees of severity of EVB and liver disease.

### Treatment of variceal bleeding [^114JpZQB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the most common cause of severe gastro-intestinal bleeding in childhood. Biliary atresia and portal venous obstruction are the most common causes. Each center should have a defined management protocol reflecting local practice and expertise. For patients with acute bleeding, pharmacotherapy with octreotide should be used immediately. All of these patients should undergo therapeutic endoscopy with band ligation or sclerotherapy. All children surviving variceal hemorrhage should undergo secondary prophylaxis with band ligation. No evidence supports the routine use of primary prophylaxis in children with esophageal varices.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114xJH5Z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs alongside endoscopic management in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) varies, with multiple societies recommending a broad range of 2–5 days. Earlier studies found a 5-day duration compared to placebo alongside endoscopic therapy effective in preventing EVB, but a subsequent study showed that a 2-day duration doubled treatment failures. Since then, data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing shorter and longer durations of vasoactive drug durations have been pooled in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs). These demonstrated similar rates of 5-day variceal rebleeding with shortened durations, approximating the 2-day vasoactive drug duration, compared to longer durations, leading the European Association for the Study of the Liver to suggest that a shortened duration should be considered.

Neither of these SRMAs compared the outcomes of short vs. longer courses across a single vasoactive drug, and only 1 SRMA included a single study on octreotide, the vasoactive drug of choice due efficacy and safety, relative to terlipressin. Terlipressin, however, has recently gained approval for hepatorenal syndrome in the United States, which may increase its popularity and, while several relevant RCTs have been pooled for meta-analysis, newer published RCTs with updated management are available in addition to published RCTs on somatostatin.

Our updated SRMA aimed to add data to variceal rebleeding at 5 days, but also to pool data from multiple studies on rebleeding and mortality at time points within approximately 6 weeks, as recommended by portal hypertension guidelines. It was designed to assess each vasoactive drug individually, to determine any differences between drugs over shorter durations. Additionally, the study assessed whether the effect on EVB of shortening the duration of vasoactive drug therapy was influenced by the endoscopic technique of sclerotherapy vs. band ligation (BL), the standard of care. Finally, Child-Pugh Class C (CPCC) has been cited as a significant predictor of variceal rebleeding, with prior RCTs focusing on higher CPCC distributions. We sought to add studies across various distributions of CPCC to explore the effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations in various severities of liver disease.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — guidance statements 48–51 outline management: Patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and should therefore be considered for prophylactic nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) to prevent decompensation; this intervention may also prevent hemorrhagic complications or iron-deficiency anemia from severe PHG. In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive agents and dosing are outlined, and only one of these four agents should be used. Octreotide is given as an initial IV bolus of 50 micrograms (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous IV infusion of 50 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Vasopressin is delivered as a continuous IV infusion 0.2–0.4 U/min; can be increased to 0.8 U/min, and it should always be accompanied by IV nitroglycerin at a starting dose of 40 μg/min, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 μg/min, adjusted to maintain a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, with a duration of 24 hours. SMT (somatostatin) is given as an initial IV bolus 250 μg (can be repeated in the first hour if ongoing bleeding) and a continuous IV infusion of 250–500 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Terlipressin dosing is initial 48 hours: 2 mg IV every 4 hours until control of bleeding, then maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 hours to prevent rebleeding for 2–5 days.

The second mechanism driving portal hypertension is the increased venous portal flow. With portal hypertension, collaterals begin to develop between the portosystemic circulation, the most important being gastroesophageal varices due to their mortality rate when ruptured. Concomitant to the development of collaterals, there is splanchnic vasodilation that leads to increased blood flow in the gut and the portal system. Vasodilation also occurs in the systemic circulation creating an effective hypovolemia state and triggering the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, leading to sodium and water retention, and increased cardiac output creating overall a hyperdynamic circulatory state that maintains an increased venous portal inflow. Therapies aimed at vasoconstricting the splanchnic circulation are the current mainstay of treatment for varices, VH, and portal hypertension. Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) such as nadolol, propranolol, and carvedilol act mainly through β2 blocking effect leading to unopposed α1 vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation. In addition, β1 blocking effect leads to reduced cardiac output and reduced portal flow. Carvedilol also has α1 blocking effect which generates intrahepatic vasodilation and is therefore preferred if a person can tolerate it in terms of systemic hypotension. In the acute setting of VH, parenteral splanchnic vasoconstrictors are used: current available options include somatostatin and its analogs octreotide and vapreotide, and vasopressin and its analogue terlipressin. Availability of these agents varies by country. In the United States, only octreotide is available.

### Esophageal bleeding disorders [^1151TaQz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Esophageal varices and Mallory Weiss syndrome are the two major esophageal bleeding disorders. Although there have been major breakthroughs in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding, the management of esophageal bleeding disorders remains a challenging problem. This review focuses on studies published in the previous 12 months that provide further understanding of the appropriate treatment of various esophageal bleeding disorders. Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding are also discussed.

Recent Findings

With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacologic treatments, mortality resulting from variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Band ligation is the first-line endoscopic treatment of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Vasoactive agents such as somatostatin analog and terlipressin are both safe and effective pharmacologic treatments of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Use of a nonselective beta-blocker is still the most widely accepted treatment for both primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, the effectiveness of beta-blockers is limited by intolerance and nonresponders in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, endoscopic band ligation is used increasingly as an alternative strategy for primary prophylaxis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be reserved as rescue therapy for failure of medical and endoscopic treatments. In recent years, noninvasive surrogate markers have been reported to identify high-risk patients with large esophageal varices. Platelet count, spleen diameter, and their ratio are accurate predictors of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The endosonographic measurement of the cross-sectional surface area predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. For Mallory Weiss syndrome, endoscopic clipping is an emerging treatment modality, especially for deep laceration with risk of perforation.

Summary

A combination of various clinical, laboratory, and endosonographic parameters accurately predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. A streamlined screening strategy allows more cost-effective use of endoscopy and prompt prophylactic treatment for high-risk esophageal varices.

### Impact of timing of endoscopy on clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding: a monocentric retrospective study from Vietnam [^115ot3iS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and common medical emergency in daily clinical practice, which can lead to unpredictable consequences. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common cause of upper GI bleeding is the rupture of esophageal varices due to portal hypertension. This condition occurs when blood flow in the portal vein is obstructed by structural changes in the cirrhotic liver, resulting in elevated portal pressure and the dilation and rupture of esophageal varices. Nowadays despite advances in management, treatment, and prevention of complications in cirrhosis, the incidence of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices remains high, ranging from 20 to 40%, with a six-week mortality of 10–20%. Hence, this is a serious complication, directly threatening the patient's life if not intervened promptly. Currently, overall management of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) mainly focuses on key measures such as initial resuscitation to stabilise hemodynamics, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs to reduce portal pressure (octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin), prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopic intervention. These approaches not only control bleeding but also contribute significantly to improving long-term outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

It is undeniable that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the mainstay treatment for EVB, however, the optimal timing for endoscopy remains a topic of debate in present guidelines and research. Most existing guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline, and the Belgian guideline, suggest that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of symptom onset in cirrhotic patients with EVB. In contrast, the UK guideline recommends that in case of severe variceal bleeding and hemodynamic instability, endoscopy should be performed immediately after resuscitation. For others, it should be conducted within 24 h after hospitalisation. Meanwhile, Chinese guideline proposes that endoscopy should be conducted within 12–24 h after the presentation of variceal bleeding. Moreover, these conflicting recommendations appear to rely more on expert consensus than on solid clinical evidence.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

### Variceal rebleeding and recurrence after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy… [^1163XqYx]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Eradication of esophageal varices by repeated injection sclerotherapy and maintenance of eradication using continued surveillance endoscopy may reduce recurrent variceal bleeding and death from esophageal varices. Design A prospective study of consecutive adult patients with endoscopically proved esophageal variceal bleeding. Rebleeding was markedly reduced after eradication of varices. Varices recurred in 56 patients, of whom only 10 rebled from recurrent esophageal varices. Cumulative survival by life table analysis was 55%, 41%, and 30% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Conclusions Repeated injection sclerotherapy eradicated esophageal varices in most long-term patients. Complications related to injection sclerotherapy were mostly minor. Complete eradication of varices reduced rebleeding and death from esophageal varices.

The data presented are based on a protocol using a standardized injection technique, with eradication of esophageal varices the predetermined end point of repeated sclerotherapy.
37. Esophageal varices were eradicated in 99 of the 113 patients after a median of 5 injections during a mean of
8. 0 months. Esophageal varices remained eradicated in 43 patients. Varices were eradicated in 11 of the 13 patients with primary extrahepatic portal venous obstruction after a mean of 5 injections during a mean of 11 months in the eradicated patients. In 64 of the 74 patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis who survived and were followed up for more than 3 months, varices were eradicated, requiring a mean of 6 injections during a mean of 9. 7 months.

Repeated sclerotherapy successfully eradicated esophageal varices after a median of 5 sclerotherapy sessions in 99 of the 113 patients followed up for more than 90 days. Overall, the varices remained eradicated for a mean of 38 months. Although new varices formed following initial obliteration in 53 of the 100 patients, this was associated with rebleeding from varices in only 8 patients.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.
