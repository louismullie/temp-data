## Question

True or false "Cytomegalovirus is one of the TORCH vaccine-preventable disease"

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a vaccine-preventable disease within the TORCH group. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what TORCH includes and whether CMV is indeed a member. Then, I should verify the current status of CMV vaccine development and whether any vaccine is licensed or routinely used. Next, I will compare CMV with the other TORCH pathogens that do have effective vaccines, like rubella, to ensure I'm not conflating screening or prevention strategies with actual vaccine availability. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and state the implication for current public health practice.

> Let me first confirm the TORCH construct and CMV's place in it. TORCH classically refers to Toxoplasma gondii, other pathogens, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, and multiple contemporary sources explicitly list CMV as a core TORCH pathogen, so CMV is indeed part of TORCH by definition [^113qz3St] [^112Q88hV] [^114V4Qvu].

> Now, I need to check the vaccine status for CMV. Wait, let me verify whether any CMV vaccine is licensed or in routine use. The literature consistently states that despite decades of effort, there is no licensed CMV vaccine; several candidates have shown partial efficacy in trials, but none have achieved licensure or programmatic deployment, and current prevention relies on hygiene measures rather than immunization [^116Bb8Ua] [^111rNJwR] [^114GQQey] [^113jtPjr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should compare this with TORCH pathogens that are actually vaccine-preventable. Rubella is a clear counterexample: live-attenuated rubella vaccine is part of MMR, confers durable protection, and has led to elimination of rubella in several countries, illustrating what "vaccine-preventable" looks like in practice for a TORCH disease; by contrast, no such licensed vaccine exists for CMV, so calling CMV "vaccine-preventable" would be inaccurate today [^116EcEjx].

> I should double-check the nuance here. Some might argue that because CMV is a TORCH pathogen and vaccines are in development, it is "vaccine-preventable" in principle; but wait, that conflates investigational status with current public health reality. The correct interpretation is that CMV is not currently vaccine-preventable, even though it is a TORCH pathogen and vaccine research is ongoing, so the statement as posed is false for present-day practice [^116Bb8Ua] [^111rNJwR] [^113qz3St].

> Final answer: False. CMV is a TORCH pathogen, but there is no licensed vaccine for CMV at this time, so it is not currently a vaccine-preventable disease within TORCH [^113qz3St] [^116Bb8Ua].

---

The statement is **false**. CMV is a TORCH pathogen [^113qz3St], but there is **no licensed vaccine** to prevent CMV infection or congenital CMV disease [^116Bb8Ua] [^114J6x9Q]. Vaccine candidates are in development [^114UrPKj] and have shown partial efficacy in trials [^116Kb18p], but none are approved for routine use [^116EcEjx]. Current prevention relies on hygiene measures and supportive care, not vaccination [^114GQQey] [^1135sE4S].

## CMV as a TORCH pathogen

CMV is a **TORCH pathogen** [^113qz3St] — a group of infections that can cause severe fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [^114V4Qvu]. CMV is the most common congenital infection globally, with a birth prevalence of approximately 0.5–1% [^1145tkZi] and is a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental impairment in children [^113jtPjr].

---

## Current status of CMV vaccine development

Despite decades of research, **no licensed CMV vaccine** exists [^116Bb8Ua]. Several candidates have been evaluated, including live-attenuated, subunit, and vector-based vaccines [^113uwMKt], with partial success in clinical trials [^116Kb18p]. For example, a glycoprotein B (gB) subunit vaccine demonstrated approximately 50% efficacy in preventing CMV infection in seronegative women [^116Kb18p], but failed to meet endpoints in later-phase studies [^notfound]. Similarly, a bivalent DNA vaccine (ASP0113) did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints in a phase 3 trial of seropositive hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^117NKhte]. Recent mRNA-based candidates are under investigation [^1157DGNv], but none have resulted in a licensed product to date [^116EcEjx].

---

## Comparison with other TORCH infections

In contrast to CMV, several other TORCH infections are preventable by vaccination:

- **Rubella**: Vaccination has significantly reduced congenital rubella syndrome incidence worldwide [^116EcEjx].
- **Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)**: Vaccination prevents congenital varicella syndrome.
- **Hepatitis B virus (HBV)**: Vaccination prevents mother-to-child transmission.

Thus, while some TORCH infections are vaccine-preventable, **CMV is not** [^116EcEjx].

---

## Current prevention strategies for CMV

In the absence of a vaccine, **prevention of CMV infection** relies on hygiene measures, including:

- Frequent handwashing, especially after contact with young children or handling diapers.
- Avoiding sharing utensils, drinks, or toothbrushes.
- Avoiding contact with saliva or other bodily fluids from young children.

These measures are particularly important for pregnant women and those planning pregnancy [^114GQQey].

---

## Conclusion

CMV is a TORCH pathogen, but there is **no licensed vaccine** to prevent CMV infection or congenital CMV disease [^116Bb8Ua]. Vaccine development is ongoing, but current prevention relies on hygiene and supportive care, not vaccination [^114GQQey].

### SARS-CoV-2: is it the newest spark in the TORCH? [^1137xWr7]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Amid the rapidly evolving global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has already had profound effects on public health and medical infrastructure globally, many questions remain about its impact on child health. The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public health priority. Vaccines targeting women of reproductive age, and in particular pregnant patients, should be evaluated in clinical trials and should include the endpoints of neonatal infection and disease.

### Vaccine development to prevent cytomegalovirus disease: report from the national vaccine advisory committee [^1151MUAs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common intrauterine infection in the United States, and it exacts a heavy toll when it infects children and immunocompromised individuals. A CMV vaccine was assigned the highest priority by the Institute of Medicine in its 1999 assessment of targets for vaccine development. The priority was based on the cost and human suffering that would be alleviated by reducing the disease burden of congenital CMV infection. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee and invited experts examined the prospects for a CMV vaccine and the actions needed to bring about successful vaccine development at a National Vaccine Program Office workshop in October 2000. This article summarizes information about the changing epidemiology of CMV and immune responses to infection and immunity, and it reviews the current status of several vaccine candidates. Support of government agencies for CMV vaccine research and development is critical to address this need.

Final summary

There is an accumulating body of evidence that HCMV vaccination can influence the incidence of infection and congenital disease. There are still numerous questions to be answered and hurdles to be to overcome in HCMV vaccine development; yet interest in the field among both public and private sector researchers has blossomed over the past decade, as evidenced by the number vaccine candidates entering clinical evaluation. Thus, the future of the HCMV vaccine field is bright, with hope for unique vaccine designs that will bring an end to this common and devastating disease of pediatric and immune-suppressed populations. –

### The status of vaccine development against the human cytomegalovirus [^114UrPKj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous candidate vaccines against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease are in development. Whereas the previous article [1] provides background and opinions about the issues relating to vaccination, this article provides specifics about the vaccines in active development, as reported at a National Institutes of Health-sponsored meeting in Bethesda on September 4–6, 2018. Here, vaccine developers provide synopses of their candidate vaccines to immunize women to protect against congenital CMV disease and to prevent the consequences of CMV disease in recipients of transplanted organs or hematopoietic stem calls. The projects are presented here roughly in the descending order of their stage of development in the opinion of the first author.

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^114Nv9r6]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccination against congenital infections

Developing fetuses are extremely vulnerable to both infectious and noninfectious insults. Certain infectious agents that are often clinically silent in healthy adults can cause severe birth defects if they breach the placental barrier during critical developmental periods during pregnancy. An increasing number of pathogens are being recognized for causing congenital disease, and what was originally designated as the TORCH complex (Toxoplasma gondii, "other", Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus) is now expanded to include other infectious agents including Zika virus. Development of congenital disease can depend on the timing of infection during gestation, the infectious burden, and the pathogenesis in the fetus. The congenital syndrome for each pathogen is characterized by a variety of different developmental abnormalities, and commonly impact hearing, vision, and central nervous system function. For many congenital infections, the timing of infection during gestation determines the relative risk to the fetus and dictates the spectrum of disease that results. For example, while infection with rubella virus during the first 9 weeks of gestation is associated with an 85% risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), this is reduced to a 52% risk between 9–12 weeks, and minimal risk for infections occurring after 16 weeks of gestation. In contrast, the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis has been demonstrated to be highest during third trimester pregnancy, which is hypothesized to be due to differential expression of placental toll-like receptors, including TLR6, within first compared with third trimester trophoblast cells. Similarly, maternal infection with Listeria monocytogenes is typically associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes during the third trimester, though infection during the first trimester in nonhuman primates also leads to rapid fetal demise.

### Current status of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a call to action [^114hVUgz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Despite recent progress, many questions remain unanswered, including better understanding of the immunology and virology of CMV vertical transmission, and optimal approaches for secondary and tertiary prevention of CCMV-related sequelae (Table 1). However, there are key clinical interventions that can be implemented now, which reflect a shift towards prevention of CMV infection, alongside addressing treatment. Indisputably, the immediate focus should be upon public and HCP education (including awareness of hygiene-based prevention measures), alongside developing and strengthening equitable and evidence-based pathways for antenatal and postnatal management, even in the absence of universal screening. Advocacy from the CCMV community has built international recognition of the global impact of CCMV for children and families, health and social care services. It is now time for the clinical and academic community to step-up and collaboratively apply the evidence we have for pragmatic clinical practice while on-going and new scientific studies address the gaps in understanding.

### Scientific and regulatory considerations for efficacy studies of cytomegalovirus vaccines [^112v3hUu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The considerable public health burden due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) supports current interest in vaccine development. Clinical studies intended to support regulatory action should be designed to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. However, design and conduct of clinical endpoint studies may be hampered by low incidence of disease, especially for congenital CMV. Discussion and experience from other vaccines directed against congenital disease (including rubella and Zika) may be instructive. This article summarizes current scientific and US regulatory considerations related to design of studies of vaccines intended to prevent congenital CMV and complications of CMV in transplantation, as discussed at the 2018 workshop entitled "Cytomegalovirus Infection: Advancing Strategies for Prevention and Treatment".

### Indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: implications for vaccine development [^1179Ms4Y]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Development of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine is a high priority due to its significant global impact-contributing to mortality in immunosuppressed individuals, neurodevelopmental delay in infected neonates and non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss. The impact of CMV on the general population has been less well studied; however, a wide range of evidence indicates that CMV may increase the risk of atherosclerosis, cancer, immunosenescence, and progression of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus. Due to the high seroprevalence of CMV worldwide, any modulation of risk by CMV is likely to have a significant impact on the epidemiology of these diseases. This review will evaluate how CMV may cause morbidity and mortality outside of the neonatal and immunosuppressed populations and consider the potential impact of a CMV vaccine on these outcomes.

### How to use… neonatal TORCH testing [^114V4Qvu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus have in common that they can cause congenital (TORCH) infection, leading to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. During the last decades, TORCH screening, which is generally considered to be single serum testing, has been increasingly used inappropriately and questions have been raised concerning the indications and cost-effectiveness of TORCH testing. The problems of TORCH screening lie in requesting the screening for the wrong indications, wrong interpretation of the single serum results and in case there is a good indication for diagnosis of congenital infection, sending in the wrong materials. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical consequences of congenital TORCH infections and discusses the indications for, and interpretation of, TORCH screens.

### Development of a cytomegalovirus vaccine: lessons from recent clinical trials [^113ar3Vp]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus-caused diseases are preventable. We believe that both neutralising antibodies and cell-mediated immunity are necessary for prevention. Of the CMV proteins, gB and pp65 are the minimum requirements in a vaccine to induced neutralising antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Immunisation with additional proteins, e.g., gH, gN for neutralising antibodies and IE1exon 4 and pp150 for CTL responses, would strengthen protective immune responses. Approaches to development of a safe and effective cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine for the prevention of CMV diseases include: a) a live attenuated vaccine (Towne strain); b) recombinant constructs of the attenuated Towne and the virulent Toledo CMV strains; c) subunit glycoprotein B (gB) adjuvanted with MF59 to induce neutralising antibodies; d) phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) peptide-based vaccines to induce (CTL) for use in therapeutic vaccination; e) canarypox-CMV recombinants, e.g. ALVAC-CMV(gB) and ALVAC-CMV (pp65) to induce neutralising antibodies and CTL responses, respectively; f) DNA plasmids containing the genes for gB and pp65; g) dense bodies containing the key antigens. The attenuated Towne strain, gB/MF59, ALVAC-CMV(gB) and ALVAC-CMV(pp65) approaches have already been tested in clinical trials. The Towne vaccine induced neutralising antibodies and cell-mediated immunity (including CTLs) mitigated CMV disease in seronegative renal transplant recipients and protected against a low-dose virulent CMV challenge in normal volunteers but did not prevent infection in mothers of children excreting CMV. Immunisation with gB/MF59 resulted in high levels of neutralising antibodies in seronegative subjects. ALVAC-CMV(gB) did not induce neutralising antibodies but primed the immune system to a Towne strain challenge, while ALVAC-CMV(pp65) induced long-lasting CTL responses in all originally seronegative volunteers, with CTL precursor frequency similar to naturally seropositive individuals. These results suggest that CMV diseases can be prevented or attenuated and that a vaccine combining ALVAC-CMV(pp65) with gB/MF59 may induce sufficient CTLs and neutralising antibodies to protect against CMV diseases. Meanwhile, other approaches such as DNA peptide and dense body vaccines, should enter Phase I trials. All candidate vaccines will have to demonstrate that immunogenicity provides protection. Combined vaccines containing canarypox (ALVAC) vectors to express CMV-pp65 to induce CTLs and of subunit gB, given together with an appropriate adjuvant to induce neutralising antibodies, should be tested in a target population for the prevention of CMV infection and disease.

### Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: new prospects for prevention and therapy [^111CBrtD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus is the commonest congenital viral infection in the developed world, with an overall prevalence of approximately 0.6%. Approximately 10% of congenitally infected infants have signs and symptoms of disease at birth, and these symptomatic infants have a substantial risk of subsequent neurologic sequelae. These include sensorineural hearing loss, mental retardation, microcephaly, development delay, seizure disorders, and cerebral palsy. Antiviral therapy for children with symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection is effective at reducing the risk of long-term disabilities and should be offered to families with affected newborns. An effective preconceptual vaccine against CMV could protect against long-term neurologic sequelae and other disabilities.

### CMV vaccine trial endpoints [^116xdoD9]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Despite some significant challenges, there are several reasons for being optimistic about the prospect of developing vaccines against cytomegalovirus (CMV). The aim of this paper is to anticipate how positive results might be interpreted by those charged with making recommendations about universal immunisation, given that vaccines are normally expected to be highly cost-effective.

Perspective

The cost effectiveness of a CMV vaccine will be assessed by means of quality adjusted life years gained, so we should design Phase III trials to capture the required evidence directly. Given a vaccine which is equally effective in all age groups at preventing primary CMV infection, immunisation of teenagers will be more cost-effective than immunisation of toddlers, because benefits which accrue in the future are discounted financially. Protection of women of childbearing age against primary infection is important, but may fail to convince sceptics because of the need to extrapolate to protection against transmission of virus to the fetus. The preference of this author is therefore to select congenital CMV infection as the primary endpoint of a Phase III study. We should also ensure that the primary endpoint of a study immunising seronegative women is congenital CMV infection in babies born to those women, not to women in general, because of the large number of babies born to seropositives.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^116nHRr5]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaccination dynamics

All interventions are able to reduce the incidence arising through each route of transmission. The quantitative impact, however, depends strongly on the intervention (hygiene measures, vaccination during pregnancy, universal vaccination), mode of action of the vaccine (prevention of infection vs prevention of (re-)infection and reactivation), vaccination age and sex, and duration of protection by vaccination. Figure 3 shows results for vaccination of women, with a vaccine that protects for 10 years against infection and re-infection or reactivation. Here, the age at vaccination is varied from 10 to 25 years, and to 50 years, while the effectively vaccinated proportion is 30%, 70%, or 100%. Figure 3 a shows that for vaccination of 25-year-old women the incidence of cCMV decreases quite rapidly during the first 10–20 years after the start of the vaccination program, from 62 cases per million per year at the start to 42 cases per million per year after 20 years. After this, the incidence of cCMV keeps decreasing due to the indirect benefits of vaccination, albeit at a much slower pace (1 case per million per 5 years). In this scenario, the incidence of primary infection and re-infection/reactivation also decrease, but at a relatively slow pace (Fig. 3 b and Table 1).

### Indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: implications for vaccine development [^117BWDxe]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT

Whilst studies have modelled how CMV vaccination would impact the reduction of CMV associated disease in immunosuppressed patient and congenital disease, there may be unforeseen benefits of vaccination in the general population. Atherosclerosis and CVD have been associated with increased CMV IgG levels and there are clear mechanisms by which CMV could maintain atherosclerosis and promote plaque rupture (Table 1). Vaccination responses in CMV positive individuals, whilst unaffected in infancy, may be impaired in later life as demonstrated by poorer response to influenza vaccine. Additionally, CMV may synergise with other important pathogens such as TB where there is an increased risk of TB progression and disease. Many of these effects may be mediated by recurrent sub‐clinical CMV reactivation which leads to immune activation and expansion of dysfunction immune cell subsets. Following participants of vaccine studies may be the most effective way to evaluate the effect of CMV in the general population and there should be consideration for creation of registries in these trials.

### Human CMV vaccine trials: what if CMV caused a rash? [^113VrBRv]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

There are no apparent biologic obstacles to immunization against fetal/placental infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), and vaccine candidates have been developed. The major obstacles for a human CMV vaccine are difficulties associated with the design and execution of efficacy trials. These trials will be prolonged with difficulties in recruiting subjects, and hampered by several factors: First is a lack of public awareness of CMV, making recruitment into vaccine trials difficult. Second is that trials using fetal infection as an endpoint will be prolonged since vaccine administration must occur preconception. Third, behavioral changes by subjects will affect infection rates, and controls for behavioral changes will have to be in place in any clinical trial. Fourth, not all women are at equal risk for CMV infections. High risk women may become infected by contact with young children or via sexual activity. Thus, the mode of acquisition may be a confounding variable in vaccine efficacy trials. In spite of these potential obstacles, successful evaluation of CMV vaccines is possible and likely when considered against similar obstacles encountered by several other recently licensed vaccines.

### Infections during pregnancy: an ongoing threat [^11183JQ3]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital infections are an ongoing relevant cause of congenital and perinatal abnormalities since effective vaccination is not available for many diseases. Moreover, climate change, mutational evolution of pathogens, or their vectors associated with intense human traveling predispose to outbreaks and modification of the geographic distribution of traditionally limited infectious diseases. Here, we review the so-called TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, others, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes) with a special emphasis on the arboviral infections (zika, dengue, chikungunya, oropouche). Although respiratory viruses are rarely transmitted through the placenta, the maternal condition itself can cause adverse effects on the developing embryo/fetus (COVID-19, influenza). Some perinatal-acquired infections will also be briefly discussed due to their relevance in the child's development. The majority of teratogenic congenital and some perinatal-acquired infections have effects on the central nervous system or sensory organs with long-lasting disabilities. Vaccines are unavailable for several teratogenic or perinatal infections, and treatment options are still limited, particularly for arboviral and other emergent diseases. Social inequalities are associated with the prevalence, fetal outcomes and long-term disabilities of these diseases. The One Health approach could be an essential way to reduce the burden of these diseases in the population.

### A new era in cytomegalovirus vaccinology: considerations for rational design of next-generation vaccines to prevent congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^113uwMKt]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the beta-herpesvirus family, is the most common cause of congenital infection worldwide as well as an important cause of morbidity in transplant recipients and immunosuppressed individuals. An estimated 1 in 150 infants are infected with HCMV at birth, which can result in lifelong, debilitating neurologic sequelae including microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and cognitive impairment. Natural maternal immunity to HCMV decreases the frequency of reinfection and reduces risk of congenital transmission but does not completely protect against neonatal disease. Thus, a vaccine to reduce the incidence and severity of infant infection is a public health priority. A variety of candidate HCMV vaccine approaches have been tried previously, including live-attenuated viruses, glycoprotein subunit formulations, viral vectors, and single/bivalent DNA plasmids, but all have failed to reach target endpoints in clinical trials. Nevertheless, there is a great deal to be learned from the successes and failures of the HCMV vaccine field (both congenital and transplant-associated), as well as from vaccine development efforts for other herpesvirus pathogens including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein–Barr virus. Here, we review those successes and failures, evaluating recent cutting-edge discoveries that have shaped the HCMV vaccine field and identifying topics of critical importance for future investigation. These considerations will inform rational design and evaluation of next-generation vaccines to prevent HCMV-associated congenital infection and disease.

PRIMARY PREVENTION: PREVENTION OF ACQUISITION OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS IN PREGNANCY

Provision of hygiene information for CMV-seronegative pregnant women can reduce the proportion seroconverting antenatally, with high acceptability, as demonstrated in a controlled intervention study. However, an Italian study, which aimed to assess a similar intervention in CMV-seropositive women did not proceed due to lower rates of CCMV than anticipated. Authors used several methods to attempt to distinguish between reinfection or reactivation of maternal CMV where CCMV had occurred. Where available, genotype-specific IgG showed that only one of seven women had a potential reinfection with a new CMV strain. In addition, lack of association between CCMV and maternal contact with young children as well as increased risk of transmission among women with comorbidities, particularly diabetes, were taken as indirect evidence that in this cohort, most transmissions were due to reactivation rather than reinfection. In contrast, reinfection with new CMV strains have been responsible for vertical transmission in other studies (e.g. in Brazil) with reinfection identified in 2.7% of CMV-seropositive pregnant women in a recent study in Canada. Thus, the potential for hygiene recommendations to prevent CCMV among seropositive women is likely to vary by setting. Many HCPs remain inadequately informed to impart CMV hygiene advice, and there is a lack of stakeholder advocacy to integrate CMV knowledge into routine antenatal care.

CMV vaccine studies have been underway for over 50 years, and seven candidate vaccines are currently under trial. Results of a CMV mRNA phase III randomised, placebo-controlled vaccine trial in CMV-seronegative women of child-bearing age, exposed to young children, are awaited. In future, a potential CMV vaccine could be included in routine childhood immunizations, offered to adolescents, or to CMV-seronegative women planning pregnancy. However, protection of infants of CMV-seropositive women requires significant progress to be made in understanding how to counteract the multiple ways in which CMV evades the host immune response. An in-vitro placental immunology study in seropositive women found that CMV-specific tissue-resident CD8+ T cells in decidual tissues can exert cytotoxic effector functions, and provide antiviral protection upon CMV-reinfection, which could inform future vaccine development approaches.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^113KknDH]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study has provided a comparative analysis of the expected effectiveness of vaccination against CMV and has shown that several options exist to reduce the incidence of congenital CMV in a time span of 20 years. Depending on the proportion of the target group that is effectively vaccinated and the duration of protection after vaccination, significant long-term reductions in the overall circulation of CMV at the population level also seem within reach. It is even conceivable that a vaccination campaign with an effective vaccine and high vaccination coverage (> 80%) could in the long run lead to elimination. In view of the associations of CMV infection with accelerated aging of the immune system, such long-term benefits could in the long run factor in heavily in future analyses of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CMV vaccination.

### Estimates of congenital cytomegalovirus-attributable infant mortality in high-income countries: a review [^113KJNCL]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

As many as 5%-10% of infants with symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) disease, or 0.4%-0.8% of all liveborn infants with cCMV infection, die in early infancy in high-income countries. However, estimates are uncertain due to several potential biases that can result from data limitations and study designs. First, infants with cCMV infections who die prior to diagnosis, which usually occurs at 1–4 weeks after birth, may be excluded from both the count of deaths and the denominator of cCMV births, resulting in left truncation and immortal time biases. These 'biases' are features of the data and do not reflect bias on the part of researchers, but understanding the potential existence of threats to validity can help with interpretation of findings. Left truncation of infant deaths occurring prior to diagnosis of cCMV can result in understatement of the burden of infant deaths due to cCMV. Conversely, overestimation of infant deaths associated with symptomatic cCMV may occur in clinical case series owing to greater representation of relatively severely affected infants owing to ascertainment and referral biases. In this review, we summarise the characteristics of 26 studies that reported estimates of cCMV-associated infant deaths, including potential biases or limitations to which those estimates may have been subject. We discuss study designs whose implementation might generate improved estimates of infant deaths attributable to cCMV. More complete estimates of the overall public health impact of cCMV could inform current and future screening, prevention, and vaccine research.

### Indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: implications for vaccine development [^1133Jntx]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Development of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine is a high priority due to its significant global impact — contributing to mortality in immunosuppressed individuals, neurodevelopmental delay in infected neonates and non‐genetic sensorineural hearing loss. The impact of CMV on the general population has been less well studied; however, a wide range of evidence indicates that CMV may increase the risk of atherosclerosis, cancer, immunosenescence, and progression of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus. Due to the high seroprevalence of CMV worldwide, any modulation of risk by CMV is likely to have a significant impact on the epidemiology of these diseases. This review will evaluate how CMV may cause morbidity and mortality outside of the neonatal and immunosuppressed populations and consider the potential impact of a CMV vaccine on these outcomes.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^111pZPRA]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 c illustrates that the reduction in cCMV after 20 years also depends strongly on the age at vaccination and proportion of the population that is effectively protected after vaccination. Unsurprisingly, the reduction in cCMV increases with increasing vaccinated proportion. Further, reductions in cCMV are generally small for vaccination programs in women who are past their reproductive age (e.g. 50 years), because there are no direct effects of vaccination on cCMV and only limited indirect effects on cCMV via reduction of prevalence in the population. The highest benefits are obtained if vaccination is given at an age where vaccine protection covers the main reproductive period (i.e. 25 years). Then, there are substantial benefits, to the extent that more than 30% and 40% of cCMV can be prevented if 70% and 100% of women are effectively vaccinated, respectively. Interestingly, where vaccination of women at 25 years is more effective than vaccination at 10 years in reducing cCMV (after 20 years), the latter strategy is slightly more effective at reducing primary infections (Table 1; 10.5% vs 9.9%).

A comparison of scenarios

Table 1 shows an overview of the impact of interventions on the reduction in the incidence of cCMV (henceforth called birth prevalence) and incidence of primary infection and re-infection/reactivation within 20 years. Intervention strategies aimed at reducing transmission from mother to child can yield substantial reductions of cCMV. Universal vaccination of females at the age of 10 and 25 years with a vaccine preventing (re-)infection and reactivation leads to 10.8% (95%CrI 9.7–12.8%) and 31.7% (95%CrI 30.6–33.6%) reduction of cCMV, respectively. If the vaccine administered to females prevents infection only, the reduction of cCMV would be 5.3% (95%CrI 4.2–6.0%) and 8.4% (95%CrI 6.6–10.7%). Vaccination of males and females at the age of 6 months, to the contrary, leads to smaller reduction in cCMV (median of 5.4%) but a much larger reduction in primary infections (median of 18.7%). Vaccination during pregnancy is very effective in reducing cCMV (median of 71.4%), but it has the least impact on primary infections. Hygiene measures are ineffective in reducing any type of infections.

On top of that, attention can also be focused on interventions that have the potential to address cytomegalovirus infection, for instance, optimization and interconnection of current programs to deliver a culturally tailored, multicomponent implementation strategy for tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus control and outcome, parenting practices or sociobehavioral nudges to reduce or at least delay cytomegalovirus transmission in a lifetime, and drug therapies, as well as novel vaccines to prevent cytomegalovirus or tuberculosis disease. Hygienic precautions and behavioral modifications remain the mainstay of mitigation strategies for preventing primary cytomegalovirus infection or reinfection with a new strain in low- and middle-income countries, where issues of safety, access, and cost preclude the use of valganciclovir. It is noteworthy that infections that are classically considered to be relatively low risk but extremely common have profound clinical sequelae on human health. These include reduction in humoral immunity after measles infection, which increases future infection risks by other pathogens, Epstein-Barr virus infection, which increases the risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection causing significant end-organ dysfunction. As such, the association between cytomegalovirus infection and tuberculosis disease should not necessarily be assumed to be benign. The important and unforeseen consequences of cytomegalovirus infection further underline the need for development of a broadly protective vaccine against the infection.

### Current status of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a call to action [^1145tkZi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Globally, congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) is by far the commonest congenital infection, although arguably, the least well recognized by the public and healthcare professionals (HCP), and least well researched considering its frequency and consequences. A meta-analysis of neonatal screening studies found a global CCMV birth prevalence of 0.67% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.83%], and three-fold higher in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) than high-income countries (HIC). This reflects the importance of nonprimary maternal CMV infection in the epidemiology of CCMV, with prepregnancy CMV-seroprevalence of more than 90 and 50–60% in LMICs and HICs, respectively. Worldwide, there are an estimated 1 760 000 infants born annually with CCMV, 356 400 of whom have CMV-related long-term sequelae (Fig. 1). Routine neonatal screening for CCMV remains rare, with state-wide screening only underway in: Ontario, New York State and Minnesota.

Clinical endpoint of congenital HCMV vaccination trials

Over the past 50 years of vaccine development to prevent congenital CMV (cCMV) infection, the field has struggled with how best to clinically evaluate vaccine efficacy. Given that cCMV is somewhat rare at a population-level (1 in 150 pregnancies) and occurs in an extraordinarily vulnerable patient population, what is the most appropriate and practical clinical trial endpoint? Should vaccination seek to reduce viral spread from toddlers, prevent infection of the mother, block viral transmission across the placenta, and/or reduce pathogenesis in the infant?The endpoint utilized in phase 2 efficacy trials of the glycoprotein B (gB) subunit vaccine was a reduction in the rate of maternal HCMV acquisition. As preexisting natural HCMV immunity is not protective against HCMV reinfection or against viral reactivation, there is a certain degree of pessimism among researchers who contend that vaccine-elicited sterilizing maternal immunity is an unrealistic goal. Yet, it is quite encouraging to future vaccine development efforts that the gB subunit vaccine demonstrated ~ 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV acquisition in women, and reduced viremia in organ transplant recipients. Potentially, if the primary outcome of gB subunit vaccination studies had been the prevention of fetal infection, the measured vaccine efficacy might have been higher.

Given that sterilizing immunity against HCMV infection may be difficult to achieve, one alternative approach (or proposal) is to prioritize a reduction in the incidence of fetal infection and/or severity of congenital disease as a clinical endpoint. Importantly, both guinea pig and rhesus macaque challenge models of cCMV transmission have given confidence to the assertion that vaccines can modulate the incidence and severity of congenital infection. In guinea pigs, immunization with a gB subunit vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine, or LCMV vectoras well as passive infusion of a gH-specific mAbhave been shown to reduce rates of cCMV infection. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that preexisting HCMV-specific antibody can reduce cCMV transmission in a rhesus monkey model. These findings justify further preclinical and clinical evaluation of vaccine candidates for their ultimate purpose — to prevent congenital infant infection and disease.

### Congenital cytomegalovirus: public health action towards awareness, prevention, and treatment [^112CEcQe]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Key awareness issues surrounding congenital CMV infection are outlined and discussed to provide inspirational motivation for many diverse groups who may have the same goal of reducing congenital CMV disease. To this end, steps for public health action towards awareness, prevention and treatment are outlined. These steps include recommendations for universal screening for all newborns for congenital CMV infection at birth to further define the public health impact and facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of newborns, routine prenatal screening of all pregnant women for the presence of CMV antibody to identify women at risk who may benefit most from preventive behavioral interventions as well as to facilitate prenatal diagnosis and therapies, and grass roots efforts to promote CMV awareness in the community.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^116ZhqfY]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is highly prevalent worldwide and can cause severe disease in immunocompromised persons and congenitally infected infants. The disease burden caused by congenital CMV infection is high, especially in resource-limited countries. Vaccines are currently under development for various target groups.

Methods

We evaluated the impact of vaccination strategies and hygiene intervention using transmission models. Model parameters were estimated from a cross-sectional serological population study (n = 5179) and a retrospective birth cohort (n = 31,484), providing information on the age- and sex-specific CMV prevalence and on the birth prevalence of congenital CMV (cCMV).

Results

The analyses show that vertical transmission and infectious reactivation are the main drivers of transmission. Vaccination strategies aimed at reducing transmission from mother to child (vaccinating pregnant women or women of reproductive age) can yield substantial reductions of cCMV in 20 years (31.7–71.4% if 70% of women are effectively vaccinated). Alternatively, hygiene intervention aimed at preventing CMV infection and re-infection of women of reproductive age from young children is expected to reduce cCMV by less than 2%. The effects of large-scale vaccination on CMV prevalence can be substantial, owing to the moderate transmissibility of CMV at the population level. However, as CMV causes lifelong infection, the timescale on which reductions in CMV prevalence are expected is in the order of several decades. Elimination of CMV infection in the long run is only feasible for a vaccine with a long duration of protection and high vaccination coverage.

Conclusions

Vaccination is an effective intervention to reduce the birth prevalence of cCMV. Population-level reductions in CMV prevalence can only be achieved on a long timescale. Our results stress the value of vaccinating pregnant women and women of childbearing age and provide support for the development of CMV vaccines and early planning of vaccination scenarios and rollouts.

### A new era in cytomegalovirus vaccinology: considerations for rational design of next-generation vaccines to prevent congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^116Kb18p]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

The HCMV gB subunit vaccine is the most efficacious tested to date, achieving ~ 50% efficacy in preventing primary HCMV infection in multiple clinical trials. Intriguingly, the use of a subunit vaccine platform has met with mixed success for several other herpesvirus pathogens. A subunit vaccine comprised of glycoprotein D from HSV-2 (gD-2) combined with the adjuvant AS04, initially demonstrated 74% efficacy in HSV-1/2-seronegative women with long-term HSV-2-infected partners, but was not effective in HSV-1 seropositive women or in men. However, in the larger phase 3 "Herpevac" trial field study, which enrolled > 8000 HSV-1/2-seronegative women, the same vaccine was 20% efficacious (95% confidence interval: −29 to 50%) against all genital herpes disease, although 58% (12–80%) efficacy was observed against genital HSV-1 disease. Efficacy against HSV-1 infection (e.g. seroconversion with or without signs of disease) was 35% (13–52%)) and there was no efficacy against HSV-2 infection (−8%; (−59 to 26%)). A subsequent analysis found that gD-2 binding antibodies, but not CD4 + T-cell responses, correlated with HSV-1 (but not HSV-2) protection. A subunit vaccine platform has also been attempted for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In a phase 2 study, the gp350 vaccine for EBV demonstrated 78% efficacy in preventing infectious mononucleosis, though negligible protection against asymptomatic EBV acquisition. These partial successes clearly indicate that a subunit vaccine platform to prevent herpesvirus pathology is indeed possible. However, clinical trial data indicate that such herpesvirus subunit vaccines may need to be focused on a subset of herpesvirus-related disease processes (zoster, HSV-1 genital disease, mononucleosis, etc), and may not be effective at preventing infection or eliciting "sterilizing" immunity.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^117K433E]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

An alternative would be indiscriminate vaccination of women with a vaccine preventing (re-)infection and reactivation before the age at which they generally will have children (20–35 years in the Netherlands). However, in terms of burden prevented, this strategy is much less effective than vaccination of pregnant women with approximately 20,000 DALYs or 30% of the expected burden prevented over a time period of 20 years. On the other hand, a general vaccination program targeting young women has the advantage that it not only reduces cCMV in the short run (albeit less so than vaccination during pregnancy), but has a larger contribution to reducing CMV circulation in the population. This potentially has as a byproduct some added advantages, for instance by indirectly protecting solid organ and stem cell transplants, and other persons with reduced immunocompetence. In our analyses, both vaccination strategies could in the long run even lead to elimination, but this would require a sufficiently high vaccination coverage together with a long duration of protection by vaccination spanning the reproductive life span (e.g. 80% of women effectively vaccinated and 15 years of protection; Fig. 4). However, since CMV causes a lifelong infection and onward transmission is possible during reactivation, the timescale on which elimination could be achieved is very long, in the order of more than 100 years.

In our analyses, all other strategies including pediatric vaccination only prevent small proportions of the expected disease burden in the relevant short term (20 years, say). In fact, in the short term, a pediatric vaccination program is expected to be the least effective vaccination strategy in reducing cCMV but most effective at reducing primary infections. In addition, pediatric vaccination also can achieve elimination with lower effort (e.g. lower vaccinated proportion or shorter duration of protection) when compared to vaccination of young women and could be a better vaccination strategy if the goal is to reduce overall CMV transmission in the long term. This is due to the fact that the indirect effects of vaccination on horizontal transmission are strongest when the vaccine is administered at an age when contact rates are highest (i.e. children). Combining universal childhood vaccination and vaccination of pregnant women would thus seem the optimal strategy. We hope that our analyses will help to support future health economic assessments of potential CMV vaccine candidates, although our model may require modifications to support additional strategies (e.g. for other populations such as high-risk groups) and the combination of strategies (e.g. universal childhood vaccination and vaccination of pregnant women) that we did not consider here.

### Stop, think SCORTCH: rethinking the traditional'TORCH' screen in an era of re-emerging syphilis [^112Q88hV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemiology of congenital infections is ever changing, with a recent resurgence in syphilis infection rates seen in the UK. Identification of congenital infection is often delayed; early recognition and management of congenital infections is important. Testing modalities and investigations are often limited, leading to missed diagnostic opportunities.

Methods

The SCORTCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 'other', rubella, toxoplasmosis, chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and blood-borne viruses) acronym increases the awareness of clinicians to the increased risk of congenital syphilis, while considering other infectious aetiologies including: zika, malaria, chagas disease, parvovirus, enterovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1, in addition to the classic congenital infections recognised in the 'TORCH screen' (toxoplasmosis, 'other', rubella, CMV, HSV). The SCORTCH diagnostic approach describes common signs present in infants with congenital infection, details serological testing for mother and infant and important direct diagnostics of the infant. Direct diagnostic investigations include: radiology, ophthalmology, audiology, microbiological and PCR testing for both the infant and placental tissue, the latter also warrants histopathology.

Conclusion

The traditional 'TORCH screen' focuses on serology-specific investigations, often omits important direct diagnostic testing of the infant, and fails to consider emerging and re-emerging congenital infections. In recognition of syphilis as a re-emerging pathogen and the overlapping clinical presentations of various infectious aetiologies, we advocate for a broader outlook using the SCORTCH diagnostic approach.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common pathogen, associated with mild illness in most immunocompetent people. Historically, research on CMV infection in the relatively immunocompromised premature and small-for-gestational age neonatal population has been neglected. Recent studies have not only defined factors important in the transmission of CMV, but also led to the suggestion of serious morbidity related to postnatal acquisition. The burden of postnatal CMV disease and the risk-benefit of screening and prevention strategies are all still unclear.

### Current evidence gaps to support systematic cytomegalovirus screening in pregnancy [^1173kRJF]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Lack of evidence to justify screening

Screening is defined as the early detection of a latent disorder through testing, to allow for an early intervention to improve prognosis. One of the purposes of prenatal screening is to detect diseases in the foetus and to provide parents with information about follow up, treatment and management options, so that they can make an evidence-based informed choice about whether to continue or not with pregnancy if they know that the foetus has a higher risk of having a serious condition. Any systematic screening programme, proposed as a public health intervention, must include a clear definition of the targeted disorder and population, early detection test(s), diagnostic confirmation, proposed intervention, and a description of the programme operational modalities, from the proposal of the early detection test(s) to the management of the disorder and of the consequences of testing (false positives, false negatives) and the proposed intervention (side effects of treatment…). In addition, it must be demonstrated that this program can be effective, safe and acceptable to targeted individuals, including those without the disorder, and to the health care system, and can be delivered equitably. Ideally, the effectiveness of the screening programme in reducing mortality or morbidity, and the absence of disadvantages should be proven by high-quality randomised controlled trials.

Key message: the body of evidence is not in favour of screening

At the time of writing, no randomised trial comparing the effect of screening during pregnancy versus routine management on severe sequelae of congenital cytomegalovirus infection have been published nor registered with ClinicalTrials.gov or WHO. In the absence of a randomized trial, we analysed all available evidence, using the above-mentioned criteria (Table 1), to verify whether conditions for an effective and safe screening were met.

### Seroepidemiology of TORCH infections among 1.7 million women of childbearing age in rural China: a population-based cross-sectional study [^113AGex3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

We conducted a national seroepidemiological study of the TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii [TOX], Rubella [RV], Cytomegalovirus [CMV], and Herpes Simplex Virus) in rural women to provided updated baseline data on TORCH prevalence. A total of 1,541,329 women of childbearing age were gathered from 2010 to 2012 in China. Of these, 858,072 women were tested positive for anti-RV IgG antibodies, 602,251 women were tested positive for anti-CMV antibodies, and 40,055 women were tested positive for anti-TOX antibodies. TORCH prevalence was highest among young adults (aged 25–34 years; P < 0.0001). A total of 69,220 women (4.49%) had received RV vaccination, of whom 49,988 (72.2%) had vaccine-acquired immunity. Of 1,541,329 women, 6,107 (0.40%) tested positive for anti-TOX IgM antibodies and 6,646 (0.43%) tested positive for anti-CMV IgM antibodies, suggesting the presence of TOX and CMV infections. TORCH markers were all more prevalent in the eastern region of China than in the central or western regions (all P < 0.0001). Prevalence rates related to all recent infection markers of TOX and CMV increased with increasing age in all regions (P < 0.0001). TORCH prevalence rates were found to be lower than previously published rates. This may be attributed to improvements in living standards and health habits in China. However, considering that the decrease in prevalence has led to an increase in the number of susceptible people, and the partial immunity caused by some pathogenic infections still leave infected people at risk of reinfection, strengthened vaccination and health education is essential to improve the quality of life of the Chinese population.

### Infections at the maternal-fetal interface: an overview of pathogenesis and defence [^113qz3St]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Infections are a major threat to human reproductive health, and infections in pregnancy can cause prematurity or stillbirth, or can be vertically transmitted to the fetus leading to congenital infection and severe disease. The acronym 'TORCH' (Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus) refers to pathogens directly associated with the development of congenital disease and includes diverse bacteria, viruses and parasites. The placenta restricts vertical transmission during pregnancy and has evolved robust mechanisms of microbial defence. However, microorganisms that cause congenital disease have likely evolved diverse mechanisms to bypass these defences. In this Review, we discuss how TORCH pathogens access the intra-amniotic space and overcome the placental defences that protect against microbial vertical transmission.

Humoral vs. cellular protective immunity

It is anticipated that any efficacious HCMV vaccine may have to engage multiple branches of the immune system. Neutralizing antibodies have been frequently associated with protection against cCMV transmission. – Furthermore, an apparent reduction in the rate and severity of cCMV infection was observed following passive infusion of HCMV-neutralizing antibodies to infected women, though this protection was not replicated in a recent phase 3, placebo-controlled trial. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, high-magnitude HCMV-specific CD4 + T-cell responses have been repeatedly correlated with protection against cCMV infection, suggesting that this cell type is likely critical in maturation of the protective antigen-specific immune response.

The debate over antibodies vs. cellular immune responses as correlates of protection is shared by the HSV vaccine field. HSV gD-binding antibodies, which exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro, were associated with modest protection against HSV-1 disease in the Herpevac trial, although the primary endpoint (protection against genital herpes) was not achieved. Similar to the HCMV gB vaccine trials, it is unclear whether the limited vaccine efficacy was due to: (1) inadequate neutralizing and/or epitope-specific gD antibody responses,(2) need for a combination of viral antigens, (3) requirement for non-neutralizing antibody functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and/or (4) failure to elicit potent antigen-specific T-cell immunity. The highly efficacious live-attenuated VZV vaccine elicits both robust and durable humoral immunityas well as potent CD4 + /CD8 + T-cell responses. Furthermore, the VZV gE subunit vaccine stimulates high-magnitude gE-specific antibodies and CD4 +, but not CD8 +, T-cell responses. These data suggest that humoral and cellular immunity may both be necessary for optimal herpesvirus vaccine efficacy.

### Congenital cytomegalovirus infection burden and epidemiologic risk factors in countries with universal screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KycY8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Congenital CMV is a major public health concern with the burden of infection estimated to be 3-fold greater in LMICs than HICs. It is necessary to better understand the economic burden of cCMV and provide more robust evaluations of health care interventions designed to reduce its incidence and impact. Nationally representative population-based studies, particularly in LMICs, are needed to assess the burden of cCMV in those regions. Region-specific prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options, and community-based education programs are needed to mitigate the incidence of cCMV and its sequelae, particularly in resource-poor settings.

### Fetal therapies for cytomegalovirus: what we tell prospective parents [^114GQQey]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital CMV is the most common congenital infection in the developed world. Infection results in congenital disease ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and occasionally fetal or neonatal death. Fetal infection can occur through maternal-fetal transmission during primary maternal infection or maternal reactivation or re-infection. Awareness among maternal health care providers and parents is low. The prevention of maternal CMV infection currently relies on hygiene measures, with no effective CMV vaccine or prophylactic therapies. No licensed treatment options are available to prevent maternal-fetal transmission or fetal disease. Hyperimmunoglobulin and valaciclovir have been investigated for prevention of maternal-fetal transmission or fetal treatment, with some evidence supporting consideration of maternal administration of hyperimmunoglobulin or valaciclovir therapy in certain circumstances. This article outlines the clinical evidence regarding proven preventative behavioral measures and experimental hyperimmunoglobulin and valaciclovir therapies, that is structured around common questions asked by pregnant women about CMV infection. It is aimed to help maternity health care providers counsel prospective parents about congenital CMV disease and the preventative and therapeutic strategies currently available.

### Pathogenesis of human cytomegalovirus in the immunocompromised host [^111cbBjp]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that infects ~60% of adults in developed countries and more than 90% in developing countries. Usually, it is controlled by a vigorous immune response so that infections are asymptomatic or symptoms are mild. However, if the immune system is compromised, HCMV can replicate to high levels and cause serious end organ disease. Substantial progress is being made in understanding the natural history and pathogenesis of HCMV infection and disease in the immunocompromised host. Serial measures of viral load defined the dynamics of HCMV replication and are now used routinely to allow intervention with antiviral drugs in individual patients. They are also used as pharmacodynamic read-outs to evaluate prototype vaccines that may protect against HCMV replication and to define immune correlates of this protection. This novel information is informing the design of randomized controlled trials of new antiviral drugs and vaccines currently under evaluation. In this Review, we discuss immune responses to HCMV and countermeasures deployed by the virus, the establishment of latency and reactivation from it, exogenous reinfection with additional strains, pathogenesis, development of end organ disease, indirect effects of infection, immune correlates of control of replication, current treatment strategies and the evaluation of novel vaccine candidates.

### Immune correlates of protection against human cytomegalovirus acquisition, replication, and disease [^116XsZj3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common infectious cause of infant birth defects and an etiology of significant morbidity and mortality in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. There is tremendous interest in developing a vaccine or immunotherapeutic to reduce the burden of HCMV-associated disease, yet after nearly a half-century of research and development in this field we remain without such an intervention. Defining immune correlates of protection is a process that enables targeted vaccine/immunotherapeutic discovery and informed evaluation of clinical performance. Outcomes in the HCMV field have previously been measured against a variety of clinical end points, including virus acquisition, systemic replication, and progression to disease. Herein we review immune correlates of protection against each of these end points in turn, showing that control of HCMV likely depends on a combination of innate immune factors, antibodies, and T-cell responses. Furthermore, protective immune responses are heterogeneous, with no single immune parameter predicting protection against all clinical outcomes and stages of HCMV infection. A detailed understanding of protective immune responses for a given clinical end point will inform immunogen selection and guide preclinical and clinical evaluation of vaccines or immunotherapeutics to prevent HCMV-mediated congenital and transplant disease.

### Short-and long-term impact of vaccination against cytomegalovirus: a modeling study [^111j7jvb]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Intervention scenarios

We considered several intervention strategies, namely hygiene measures aimed at preventing CMV (re-)infection of women of reproductive age from young children, vaccination during pregnancy reducing the probability of vertical transmission, and a suite of universal vaccination strategies with varying proportions of effectively vaccinated persons, ages at vaccination, sexes to be vaccinated, and durations of protection.

For universal vaccination, we further distinguished between scenarios in which the vaccine is assumed to protect only against primary infection in seronegative persons ("prevention of infection") or against primary infection in seronegative persons and re-infection/reactivation in seropositive persons ("prevention of (re-)infection and reactivation"). The target population for vaccination was either infants in the first year of life, adolescent boys and girls at the age of 10 years, adolescent girls at the age of 10 years, or women of reproductive age (15–50 years).

In the baseline scenario, we assumed that the proportion of effectively vaccinated persons (henceforth called effectively vaccinated proportion = vaccination coverage × vaccine efficacy) was 70%. The average duration of protection by the vaccine was 10 years. Hygiene measures assumed a 70% reduction in infectious contacts between 15–50-year-old women and 0–5-year-old children.

Main outcome measures were the reduction in the incidence of cCMV, primary infection and re-infection/reactivation, and DALYs prevented after 20 years. In addition, we evaluated the long-term impact of an intervention by computing the effective reproduction number and (critical) proportion of persons who must be effectively vaccinated to eliminate CMV from the population. The effective reproduction number quantifies the intervention effort necessary for disease elimination. In theory, a disease is eliminated whenever this number is below 1.

The model was implemented using a system of ordinary differential equations for 16 5-year age groups and a group of 0–6-month-old infants (Additional File 1: Appendix). All interventions were introduced from the endemic equilibrium. The disease burden for the Netherlands was computed using an estimate of 3.034 (95%CrI 1.202–6.105) DALYs per case of cCMV.

Sensitivity analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses for the effectively vaccinated proportion and duration of protection after vaccination. Specifically, we varied the proportion from 0 to 100% and the duration of protection from 2.5 years to lifelong. In addition, we present parameter estimation and intervention results for a different set of prior distributions of the reactivation rates (Figure S4, Figure S5 and Table S2).

### Translational mini-review series on infectious disease: congenital cytomegalovirus infection: 50 years on… [^117Mk1Rq]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of congenital viral infection, with an incidence of 0.5–3% of live births worldwide. Clinical evidence has shown hearing and vision loss, mental retardation and sometimes death in affected newborns. Primary maternal CMV infection during gestation poses a 40% risk of intrauterine transmission in contrast to recurrent infection. European laboratories have made significant progress in the last decade in solving diagnostic problems linked to infection in pregnancy. With the advances in CMV serology, such as detection of anti-CMV IgM by enzyme immunoassays (EIA), confirmed by Western blot, together with seroconversion and anti-CMV IgG avidity evaluation in pregnant mothers, can help to identify recent infection. Preventative measures such as screening for CMV in the routine serological work-up of pregnant women have been introduced in countries such as Spain and Italy. The development of specific T cell-mediated immune responses in mothers, fetus and neonates is now emerging with regard to antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, differentiation status, proliferative and cytokine responses. A protective vaccine against CMV is a major public health priority and the study of vaccines in animal model systems has identified potential strategies for interrupting transmission and preventing disease in newborns. Congenital CMV infection has a variable outcome and therefore novel diagnostic methods are required to identify those at risk and therapeutic interventions are needed to improve the long-term prognosis of those infected. CMV was first isolated in 1957. We are now 50 years on, so procrastination is not an option.

### Cytomegalovirus vaccine: phase II clinical trial results [^115RUTjY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most significant viral pathogens during pregnancy and in immunocompromised patients. Antiviral prophylactic strategies are limited by toxicities, drug-drug interactions and development of antiviral resistance. A safe and protective vaccine against CMV is highly desirable in view of the potential positive impact on CMV-associated morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare costs. Unfortunately, this demand could not be met in the past four decades although development of a CMV vaccine has been ranked at the highest priority by the US Institute of Medicine. Multiple different vaccine candidates have been developed and evaluated in phase I clinical trials and few succeeded to phase II trials. Nevertheless, two different vaccines showed recently promising results in trials that studied healthy adults and immunocompromised solid-organ and bone-marrow transplant recipients, respectively. The gB/MF59 vaccine exhibited a vaccine efficacy of 50% in healthy, postpartum females. In transplant patients, gB/MF59 and the DNA vaccine TransVax both limited the periods of viraemia and consequently the need for antiviral treatment. The success of these trials is encouraging and will probably give new impetus to the development of an effective CMV vaccine. Sterilizing immunity may not be attainable in the near future and may not be necessary for a CMV vaccine to have a significant impact on health care as discussed in the present review.

TABLE 2
Proposed areas of research to better understand the impact of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine

Currently, vaccine modelling and cost effectiveness studies have only considered the direct effects of CMV. Modelling the indirect effects of CMV is severely limited by lack of detailed epidemiological evidence which can be used to inform accurate parameters (Table 2). There are several well defined long‐term prospective cohort studies with CMV seropositivity data available — NONA, OCTA, EPIC (Table 1) — which could be used to form initial estimates of the impact of vaccination in reducing the burden of atherosclerosis and CVD. Using data from previous studies demonstrating increased mortality from CMV reactivation in intensive care unit, an estimate of excess deaths caused by CMV reactivation in ICU‐admitted pneumonia patients is also feasible. Future studies need to evaluate the epidemiological role and quantitative impact of CMV on outcomes such as CVD, TB, HIV, vaccination responses and cancer (Table 2), which will allow for more accurate modelling studies to be performed and estimate the impact of CMV vaccination. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, several HICs used population based observational data to inform the effectiveness of societal lockdowns, vaccine effectives and other public health strategies. Researchers could adopt these platforms, utilise existing routinely collected national datasets and develop novel strategies using anonymised electronic healthcare records to conduct observational studies evaluating the association between CMV and the conditions outlined.

### Health and economic evaluation of cytomegalovirus vaccination strategy among young women in China: a modelling study [^115BEUnK]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Intervention strategies and health outcomes

To identify effective approaches for reducing cases of cCMV infection, we evaluated various intervention strategies. Our previous research has elucidated the limitations of neonatal vaccination strategies. As the efficacy of vaccines gradually diminishes over time, neonatal vaccination may result in a loss of vaccine protection by the time individuals reach reproductive age. This situation also reduces the naturally acquired immunity within the population, leading to an increased proportion of seronegative women of reproductive age, who are more susceptible to CMV infection. However, CMV infection during pregnancy poses substantial risks to fetal health, including cCMV syndrome. Recognising that vaccinating women of reproductive age can significantly lower the probability of vertical transmission, we specifically targeted young women aged 20–40 years, consistent with the focus of recent clinical vaccine trials.

TORCH screening, including Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum, rubella virus, CMV and herpes virus, is a crucial component of pre-marriage health checks aimed at preventing infections during pregnancy. According to the 'China Health Statistical Yearbook 2023', the average rate of pre-marriage health check-ups in China was 74.8%, indicating a consistent annual increase. Considering the sociocultural context in China, the widely implemented pre-marriage health examination system offers a practical pathway for vaccination by leveraging existing healthcare infrastructure to enhance vaccine coverage. Consequently, we have further narrowed the reproductive-age population to identify the pre-marriage group as a crucial target for CMV vaccination. Targeting women before marriage can also ensure the establishment of an immune barrier prior to their peak fertility period, thereby maximising the preventive impact of the vaccine. According to Article 1047 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, enacted in 2021, the legal marriage age is defined as 22 years for men and 20 years for women. Furthermore, the average age of first marriage in China in 2020 was 29.4 years for men and 28 years for women. Therefore, the pre-marriage group for women was defined as those aged 20–28 years.

### Association between cytomegalovirus infection and tuberculosis disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies [^112AojjC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first systematic literature search to synthesize epidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between cytomegalovirus infection and tuberculosis disease. It provides a strong, sufficient, and consistent evidence base to highlight that cytomegalovirus infection is correlated with an increased risk of tuberculosis disease. Overall, the identified studies have a low risk of bias and are predominantly conducted on the African continent, which has been estimated to be harboring one of the highest rates of tuberculosis incidence and mortality in the world. Whilst limited by inadequate geographical coverage in countries of substantial economic losses such as south Asia and east Asia, our study recognizes an apparent burden of tuberculosis disease among vulnerable groups, including immunocompromised patients, young children, and geographically marginalized communities. Infection with cytomegalovirus is common across the globe and results in possible severe sequelae. Despite tremendous infection burden and multiple health outcomes across the life course following cytomegalovirus infection, vaccines and immune globulins are still investigational and have not yet been proven efficacious for clinical use to protect against the illness and transmission. A number of potential cytomegalovirus vaccines are currently under development, including those targeted for the prevention of congenital infection and posttransplant infection. In a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a novel DNA-based cytomegalovirus vaccine was found to be inefficacious in reducing overall mortality, end-organ disease, and viraemia by 1 year posttransplant. At present, the best recommended preventive strategies are good hygiene, frequent hand washing, and avoiding contact with others' body fluids.

Finally, the structural biology of the gH/gL/UL128–131a PC is of interest in the HCMV vaccine field. Though extremely potent epithelial cell-neutralizing antibodies are directed against UL128, UL130, and UL131 following natural infection, immunization with recombinant protein subunits or peptides induces far less potently neutralizing antibodies. This finding suggests that native folding and assembly of the full complex may be critical for optimal neutralizing antibody responses, and indeed antibodies have been identified that recognize conformational epitopes only formed by the full PC. The recently deciphered PC crystal structurebound to neutralizing antibodies has informed the molecular basis of these conformational epitopes. And wherreas the PC can be expressed in soluble form, it is unknown how stable this complex is in vivo and thus unknown whether PC subunit vaccination could elicit neutralization titers comparable to natural infection. Thus, many researchers have sought to employ epitope expression strategies such as an MVA vectoror mRNA.

### Current status of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a call to action [^111rsBoW]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, serological screening cannot identify nonprimary maternal CMV infections, which account for a significant proportion of CCMV cases, even in low-seroprevalence HICs (e.g. 50% of CCMV cases in France). Recent Dutch studies have used DNA sequencing data generated by first trimester non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for foetal aneuploidy screening to identify maternal blood samples containing CMV cell-free DNA fragments. There is evidence that these fragments could arise as a result of maternal infection and infection of the placenta and may identify both primary and nonprimary CMV infections in the first trimester. Incorporating CMV screening into an existing antenatal NIPT screening programme has potential logistical and cost benefits, but prospective clinical studies are required to link these findings with clinical outcomes.

In parallel with changes in use of CMV testing in pregnancy, there have been changes in the epidemiology of children diagnosed with CCMV in Europe, with an increasing proportion diagnosed, including some treated, in utero, and often without clinically apparent symptoms at birth. The implications of diagnosis and treatment in utero should be explored by routine collation of data, alongside outcomes for children identified with CCMV after birth.

### Review of mathematical models of vaccination for preventing congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^116pH3uA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Several cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidates are under development. To reduce the burden of congenital CMV infection, potential strategies under consideration include vaccination of adult women, adolescent girls, and/or young children (both sexes).

Methods

We reviewed 5 studies that used infectious disease modeling to assess the potential impact of vaccination for preventing congenital CMV infection. All models assumed CMV vaccination would prevent primary infection and 2 models also assumed prevention of reinfections and reactivations.

Results

Despite differences in structure, assumptions, and population data, infant vaccination (both sexes) was the optimal strategy in all models, but in 1 model vaccinating seronegative women at 19–21 years of age was also optimal (for duration of vaccine protection ≥ 8 years). In 3 models, infant vaccination increased average age at primary infection as a result of decreased secondary transmission (herd immunity) combined with waning vaccine-induced immunity. This effect could increase the risk of congenital CMV infections in populations where primary CMV infection occurs early in childhood but could be minimized by administering a second dose of vaccine during adolescence.

Conclusions

Understanding vaccine efficacy and duration of immunity, and how these might vary depending on CMV serostatus and age at vaccination, will be key to defining CMV vaccination strategies.

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^116EcEjx]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

The primary goal of vaccination strategies for protecting against fetal infections is generation of protective maternal immunity prior to pregnancy. Because congenital infections can occur in the absence of maternal symptoms, vaccines against congenital agents should ideally provide complete sterilizing immunity. Rubella is included in a live-attenuated combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which confers lifelong protective immunity. Because of the long duration of protective immunity following rubella vaccination, target populations include children and adolescent girls. However, incomplete vaccination coverage can lead to paradoxical increases in CRS due to an increase in the average age of infection, and so it is also recommended that unvaccinated women of childbearing age be counseled to receive the rubella vaccine at least one month prior to conception. The implementation of large-scale rubella vaccination programs has resulted in sufficient population-level immunity, significant reductions in CRS, and elimination of rubella virus from several developed countries, including the United States.

Following successful implementation of MMR vaccination programs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) has emerged as the most common congenital viral infection in the developed world. The incidence of congenital CMV varies based on geographic region and socioeconomic status, but overall birth prevalence is estimated to be 0.64%, which is similar to the incidence of Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. In contrast to rubella virus, however, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for CMV, and with seroprevalence approaching 100% in some developing countries, vaccine development has been identified as a priority public healthcare goal. While CMV infection of healthy adults is usually asymptomatic, adaptive immune responses are insufficient to clear the infection, which results in lifelong latent infection of myeloid precursor cells. Although latent or reactivated CMV is less likely to cause congenital infection than a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, preconception immunity does not completely eliminate transplacental transmission and congenital disease. Moreover, pregnant women with latent CMV infection are still susceptible to primary infection with different CMV strains, which have been shown to have distinct virulence patterns. Overcoming the challenges associated with latent infections and strain variability are significant hurdles in the development of an effective CMV vaccine, and despite significant advances in our knowledge of CMV pathogenesis, the precise immune targets that constitute fetal protection remain unknown. Of the several CMV vaccine candidates that have been tested, none have provided complete protection against infection, and all have failed to protect against reactivation of latent CMV. More research on the pathogenesis CMV infection is needed to define immunological correlates of protection against CMV transmission during pregnancy to inform vaccine development.

Recognize that a negative CMV cell-mediated immunity result indicates a negative CMV infection status, whereas a positive CMV cell-mediated immunity result indicates a true history of CMV infection.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common non‐genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss in neonates and a leading cause of neurodevelopmental delay. In the immunocompromised host, CMV reactivation results in vasculopathy, graft rejection and severe end organ damage. Subsequently, the development of a vaccine against CMV has been cited as a high priority for the last 2 decades including by the National Institute of Health.

CMV has been associated with several distinct disease processes– atherosclerosis, cancerand impaired immune response to vaccination. Additionally, CMV is suspected to enhance the pathogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB). Animal studies and large population based epidemiological studies suggest that CMV may cause disease through mechanisms such as CD8+ memory T‐cell inflation; immunosenescence and immunomodulation. In addition, reactivation of CMV in local tissues may result in lytic replication and cause direct damage to tissues. However, current evidence has only demonstrated an association rather than causal role in these disease processes.

The primary objectives of developing a vaccine against CMV have been to eliminate congenital infection and to reduce morbidity and mortality in highly immunosuppressed individuals. However, this review presents evidence that CMV may also contribute to the development of vascular, infectious, and oncological conditions in the general population. Globally, CMV seroprevalence is estimated to be between 60% and 90%and therefore if there is any modulation in risk by CMV, vaccination is likely to have a significant impact on the incidence of these diseases. We used PubMed to perform a literature review of the epidemiology and potential pathogenic mechanisms of CMV using search terms 'CMV' or 'cytomegalovirus' or 'human cytomegalovirus' in combination with 'atherosclerosis', 'cancer', 'HIV', 'TB' or 'vaccination'. We included these themes as they represent the most studied areas of CMV in the general population, and areas where there would be the greatest implications if a causal interaction did exist. We performed a separatesearch for CMV vaccination trials. In this review, we focus on the potential indirect effects of CMV in the general population, and methods to evaluate the effect of vaccination on associated disease development during and after vaccine trials.

The role of non-neutralizing antibodies in anti-HCMV immunity is gradually being recognized. A recent study examined the ability of neutralizing and non-neutralizing gB-specific antibodies to reduce viral replication in a murine CMV (MCMV) model when given prior to MCMV inoculation (prophylactically) or following MCMV infection (therapeutically). When given prophylactically, neutralizing antibodies had the greatest therapeutic effect on viral load, though both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies were equally effective in preventing mouse mortality. In addition, we recently identified that non-neutralizing antibodies were likely responsible for the 50% vaccine efficacy observed in an HCMV gB subunit vaccine trial. In previous phase 1 trials, the gB/MF59 vaccine was observed to elicit a high titer of gB-specific antibodies, though relatively low-level neutralizationthat is enhanced in the presence of complement. Therefore, the induction of neutralizing antibodies has long been thought to be the mechanism of partial vaccine efficacy. However, in a detailed evaluation of the vaccine-elicited responses in a phase 2 trial of postpartum women gB/MF59 vaccinees, there were no neutralizing responses detectable against heterologous viral strains, suggesting both: (1) a possible difference in the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies in postpartum women compared to healthy, non-recently pregnant individuals and/or (2) that neutralizing antibodies may not have been necessary for the partial vaccine efficacy.

### Cytomegalovirus in pregnancy: to screen or not to screen [^113XLsyz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is now the commonest congenital form of infective neurological handicap, recognized by the Institute of Medicine as the leading priority for the developed world in congenital infection. In the absence of an effective vaccine, universal screening for CMV in pregnancy has been proposed, in order that primary infection could be diagnosed and- potentially- the burden of disability due to congenital CMV prevented.

Discussion

Universal screening for CMV to identify seronegative women at the beginning of pregnancy could potentially reduce the burden of congenital CMV in one of three ways. The risk of acquiring the infection during pregnancy has been shown to be reduced by institution of simple hygiene measures (primary prevention). Among women who seroconvert during pregnancy, CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV HIG) shows promise in reducing the risk of perinatal transmission (secondary prevention), and CMV HIG and/ or antivirals may be effective in reducing the risk of clinical sequelae among those known to be infected (tertiary prevention). The reports from these studies have re-ignited interest in universal screening for CMV, but against the potential benefit of these exciting therapies needs to be weighed the challenges associated with the implementation of any universal screening in pregnancy. These include; the optimal test, and timing of screening, to maximize detection; an approach to the management of equivocal results, and the cost effectiveness of the proposed screening program. In this article, we provide an overview of current knowledge and ongoing trials in the prevention, diagnosis and management of congenital CMV. Recognising that CMV screening is already being offered to many patients on an ad hoc basis, we also provide a management algorithm to guide clinicians and assist in counseling patients.

Summary

We suggest that- on the basis of current data- the criteria necessary to recommend universal screening for CMV are not yet met, but this position is likely to change if trials currently underway confirm that CMV HIG and/ or antivirals are effective in reducing the burden of congenital CMV disease.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a messenger RNA-based cytomegalovirus vaccine in healthy adults: results from a phase 1 randomized clinical trial [^1157DGNv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

To enable efficient development of CMV vaccines, a key focus is establishment of immunologic correlates of protection, which can serve as intermediate trial endpoints, thus allowing for more rapid identification of highly effective vaccines. While a validated correlate of protection for CMV is not well established, the partial protection against CMV-related outcomes induced by natural CMV infection indicates that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are important. The presence of CMV-specific antibodies and T-cell responses have been correlated with reduced incidence and severity of congenital CMV infection. Congenital CMV infection risk among infants born to CMV-seropositive mothers following nonprimary infection is considerably lower than those born to CMV-seronegative mothers who acquire primary CMV infection during pregnancy (3% vs 30%–70%, respectively), suggesting that preexisting maternal immunity is partly protective against fetal infection. Prior immunity is also an important factor in determining CMV infection risk in transplant recipients and reflects differences in underlying host immunobiology and influence of CMV strain-dependent immune responses. In a large cohort study, CMV infection risk in the hematopoietic cell transplant population was highest among CMV-seropositive recipients from CMV-seronegative donors (infection risk of 56%) and CMV-seropositive donors (53%), with lung transplant risk at 42% and 37% in CMV-seronegative and CMV-seropositive recipients, respectively, from CMV-seropositive donors. Together, observations in pregnant and immunocompromised populations highlight that natural immunity alone is insufficient for protection against CMV. A CMV vaccine that induces robust humoral and cell-mediated immunity to prevent primary infection and reactivation of latent virus could therefore substantially impact the burden of CMV infection and disease. Furthermore, as acquired immunity appears to be insufficient to prevent reinfection, it will be important to evaluate the different components of the vaccine-elicited immune response and whether they translate to cross-strain protection over time. Such an evaluation could contribute to the currently limited body of work focusing on infection and immune response dynamics between CMV strains.

Our group previously established a nonhuman primate model for cCMV transmissionobserving that depletion of CD4 + T cells prior to primary rhesus CMV (RhCMV) infection resulted in universal congenital RhCMV infection and a high frequency of fetal loss. We subsequently used this model to investigate the ability of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to protect against placental CMV transmission and fetal loss following primary maternal infection. Pregnant, RhCMV-seronegative, CD4 + T-cell depleted dams were treated with hyperimmune globulin purified from RhCMV-seropositive monkeys, then inoculated with RhCMV. Intriguingly, the pre-infused antibody provided complete protection against fetal loss, while the most potently neutralizing HIG product blocked placental RhCMV transmission. These studies indicate that antibody alone can be protective against cCMV transmission and could be a primary target of vaccines to eliminate this disease. We hypothesize that depletion of CD4 + T cells impacts the incidence of congenital RhCMV infection due to the impact on antibody maturation pathways, though we have not excluded any potential protection of cell-mediated immunity in the rhesus monkey model.

### Current evidence gaps to support systematic cytomegalovirus screening in pregnancy [^112Azdrz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

The benefits of screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection during pregnancy remain a topic of debate. To date, no randomized trial has compared the impact of screening versus routine management on the prevention of severe sequelae in newborns. Furthermore, it is unclear what actions can be taken in case of a positive screening given that there is limited evidence of effective interventions as no treatments showed significant effect on the frequency of congenital cytomegalovirus infections and, as additional challenge, the window for effective treatment initiation after maternal infection is narrow, estimated to be as short as five weeks. Universal screening of all pregnant women could lead to a high number of false positives. There are also concerns regarding the cost-effectiveness of universal screening and the capacity of healthcare professionals that may struggle to manage the increased workload, and we argue that the conditions for implementing such a programme are not yet met. In this Viewpoint we aim at highlighting these challenges and stimulating the forthcoming discussion on how to fill the gaps before CMV screening in pregnancy could be adopted as a standard practice.

### TORCH screening used appropriately in China? ─ three years results from a teaching hospital in northwest China [^113R8z9A]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, more attentions should be paid to TOX, CMV, HSV-2 and the women with BOH for TORCH screening in Xi'an region. Meanwhile, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on TORCH test used inappropriately in China, i.e.g.enerally considered to be a single serum test, ignore the evaluation of pre-gestation immune status and dynamic monitoring of IgG antibody. For diagnosis of TORCH infection, the results of serial serologic tests, PCR and clinical manifestations should be taken into account.

### A systematic review of maternal TORCH serology as a screen for suspected fetal infection [^111kmH5K]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The acronym 'TORCH' refers to well-recognised causes of perinatal infections: toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). A TORCH serology panel is often used to test for maternal primary infection following detection of ultrasound abnormalities in pregnancy.

Aim

This review aims to estimate the diagnostic yield of maternal TORCH serology in pregnancy following fetal ultrasound abnormalities.

Materials and Methods

Primary studies published since 2000 that assessed maternal TORCH serology for suspected fetal infection and included information on indications for testing, definition of positive TORCH serology results, and perinatal outcomes were included.

Results

Eight studies with a total of 2538 pregnancies were included. The main indications for testing were polyhydramnios, fetal growth restriction and hyperechogenic bowel. There were 26 confirmed cases of congenital CMV, of which 15 had multiple ultrasound abnormalities. There were no cases of congenital toxoplasmosis, rubella or HSV confirmed in any of the eight studies.

Conclusions

The clinical utility of TORCH serology for non-specific ultrasound abnormalities such as isolated fetal growth restriction or isolated polyhydramnios is low. It is time to retire the TORCH acronym and the reflex ordering of 'TORCH' panels, as their continued use obscures, rather than illuminates, appropriate investigation for fetal ultrasound abnormalities.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112QfJSo]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus disease — epidemiology and risk in people with HIV: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus in the herpesvirus family that can cause disseminated or localized end-organ disease in people with HIV. In the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2004, overall CMV seroprevalence for individuals aged 6 to 49 years was 50.4%, and higher CMV seropositivity was associated with older age; being female; foreign birthplace; and markers of lower socioeconomic status. Globally, CMV seroprevalence is generally higher among developing countries, with seroprevalence between 40% to 70% of adults in most high-income countries, compared with 80% to 100% in several low-income countries. CMV is acquired through contact with CMV-infected body fluids and can be transmitted through breastfeeding, perinatally, sexually, viral shedding in bodily fluids (saliva, urine, or tears), and through blood products (transfusions, transplantation). After primary infection, CMV establishes a lifelong latent infection that can reactivate and cause clinical disease, particularly in persons with compromised immune systems. End-organ disease caused by CMV occurs in people with HIV — especially those with advanced disease and typically among those with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 50 cells/mm3 — who are not receiving, adherent to, or responding to antiretroviral therapy (ART), whereas among those treated with ART who have achieved virologic suppression, a new diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease is exceedingly rare.

### A new era in cytomegalovirus vaccinology: considerations for rational design of next-generation vaccines to prevent congenital cytomegalovirus infection [^117NKhte]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

It has long been theorized that an HCMV vaccine might require a multi-antigen approach, incorporating diverse epitopes to optimally engage both humoral and cellular immune factors, thus maximizing the protective immunity elicited. Multi-epitope immune responses can be achieved either through vaccination with a live-attenuated virus or through delivery and/or in vivo expression of a combination of antigens. This approach is not unique to the HCMV vaccine field, as the successful live-attenuated varicella vaccine-elicited responses against many antigens and a diverse array of multivalent vaccine platforms are in development for HSV-1/HSV-2. – The most commonly trialed multi-antigen vaccine for HCMV has been the combination of gB and pp65, either as DNA or co-expressed in a viral vector, which appears safe and highly immunogenicand has demonstrated additive protection in a guinea pig congenital transmission model. However, ASP0113, a bivalent DNA vaccine encoding pp65 and gB, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints in a recent Phase 3 clinical trial of HCMV disease in seropositive hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Multi-antigen vaccines are logistically challenging to develop — particularly, if future vaccine candidates seek to incorporate the HCMV PC, which requires that five proteins be manufactured, delivered, expressed, and stabilized in a conformationally accurate manner.

Next-generation, "plug and play" vaccine platforms such as mRNA are well suited to the rapid development of multivalent vaccines, and can elicit both robust humoral and T-cell immunity. For example, gB, PC, and pp65-encoding mRNA molecules might easily be combined for use in a single vaccine. The antigenicity of multiple HCMV mRNA constructs has been recently evaluated, both alone and in combination, and observed to elicit both robust neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in mice and nonhuman primates. Reassuringly, there was no discernable interference in the neutralizing antibody responses elicited by vaccination with a single immunogen vs. multiple immunogens. However, the authors did observe an important phenomenon of T-cell epitope competition, as mRNA co-expression of PC and pp65 resulted in robust CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses against PC epitopes, but negligible responses against pp65 epitopes. Yet this competition was able to be overcome by an initial priming vaccination with pp65 alone, followed by co-administration of a pp65 and PC mRNA vaccine.

### Search continues for a CMV vaccine for transplant recipients [^112CPEY2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Finally, the question of the overall goal of CMV vaccination in the immunocompromised patient must be raised. Is complete suppression of viral load achievable? More importantly, is it necessary or is suppression of direct and indirect CMV disease manifestations the ultimate goal in the context of a vaccine strategy? Given the paucity of clinical endpoints a viral load endpoint is clearly desirable. Moreover, a therapeutic vaccine might exercise benefit in the context of low-level reactivation by further boosting the immune response, however, more data is needed to confirm this hypothesis. The definition of a viral load threshold that correlates with clinical outcomes and optimizes vaccine responses constitutes a major unmet need.

Additional challenges towards a highly effective vaccination strategy that can be applied to the allogeneic HCT population at large are how to overcome the immunosuppressive effects of steroids and other drugs used to treat and prevent GVHD as well as T cell depletion, and how we can overcome feasibility issues to take advantage of donor vaccination.

Vaccinations of immunocompromised patients pose a particular challenge and correlates of protection may differ from those in immunocompetent individuals. The study by Nakamura et al. is important to the field and will hopefully energize researchers, industry and funding agencies to facilitate a broad-range research effort that will ultimately lead to CMV vaccines that are available for various populations at risk.

### Search continues for a CMV vaccine for transplant recipients [^116ZGyvt]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

What are the open questions towards the development of an effective CMV vaccine for immunocompromised patients and, ultimately, for the general population? One key question remains: what are the correlates of protective immunity in different clinical settings? It is still poorly understood why the risk of CMV differs between various immunocompromised hosts and what the immunologic correlates are that could explain these differences. While T cell immunity is believed to be important recent positive results with vaccines that stimulate neutralizing antibodies and the discovery of the pentameric complex require studies to determine the relative importance of T cells and antibodies for protective immunity. Experiences of a broad consortium that assessed dozens of diverse immune responses as correlates of vaccine efficacy in the RV144 Phase 3 HIV vaccine trial, may suggest methodologic approaches to consider for CMV vaccine efficacy trials. The study design that stored baseline and postvaccination samples in all participants enabled the post-trial correlates study. A steering committee invited immunology labs at large to perform their assays on RV144 pilot samples, and a centralized, independent statistical group conducted uniform data analysis to down-select assays with adequate signal-to-noise properties into the case-control correlates study. Immune response biomarkers derived from the selected assays were statistically optimized and partitioned into a primary analysis tier (hypothesis testing of several biomarkers covering hypothesized protective mechanisms) and an exploratory tier (hypothesis generation). A statistical analysis plan including correlates power calculations was finalized prior to unblinding that fully pre-specified the multivariable primary analysis for detecting significant correlates of outcome. Post primary analysis, investigators at large have been invited to submit concept proposals for additional statistical and assay analyses to generate additional hypotheses about correlates of vaccine efficacy.

Potential interventions

Our advancing knowledge of CMV means that many of the Wilson and Junger criteria commonly applied to screening tests are now met for CMV; CMV is an important condition, diagnostic testing is available and the natural history of the condition is known. Nevertheless, universal screening for CMV would be predicated on the assumption that a safe, cost effective and accepted treatment or intervention exists to reduce the risk of congenital CMV among women found to be seronegative. Universal screening in pregnancy is offered for conditions of even lower prevalence such as Rubella, Hepatitis B and syphilis because of the opportunity to reduce congenital infection with simple, safe and effective interventions such as post partum rubella vaccination, post exposure prophylaxis for Hepatitis B, and timely treatment of maternal syphilis with penicillin. Interventions to reduce the risk of congenital CMV among seronegative women may be one of three types; primary prevention (preventing maternal seroconversion during pregnancy), secondary prevention (preventing fetal transmission following maternal seroconversion) or tertiary prevention (preventing disease sequelae among infected fetuses). Many of the knowledge gaps surrounding such interventions are beginning to close, re-igniting the screening debate. In part this is because several countries, including Israel and some European centres, have been conducting population based studies incorporating universal screening for some time. From such studies has come valuable information on CMV epidemiology, reliability of serological screening, key biological mechanisms for placental and fetal damage and the potential efficacy of prevention strategies and fetal treatment. These findings highlight the value of screening studies not just to the individual, but to the broader medical community, providing the necessary data to inform future screening policy.

In this article we provide a review of these and other studies, summarizing current knowledge and ongoing trials in the prevention, diagnosis and management of congenital CMV. Recognising that many clinicians have already commenced screening using one or more of the proposed screening strategies, we present the evidence in a temporal clinical sequence; (i) the management of seronegative women; (ii) the management following maternal seroconversion and (iii) the management of pregnancies where the fetus is known to be infected, summarized in Figures 1 and 2.

Congenital infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in low-income settings. This review discusses the main pathways of infections and associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, considering the TORCH pathogens, including Zika virus; the acronym stands for Toxoplasma gondii infection, other (Listeria monocytogenes, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19, among others, including Zika virus), rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2.

### Current status of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a call to action [^116ZFD2K]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Transmission rates following maternal nonprimary infection are difficult to determine due to challenges establishing CMV reinfection or reactivation during pregnancy but are estimated at 3.5% or lower. CCMV birth prevalence overall increases with higher HIV prevalence. Although vertical transmission rates are higher among mothers with primary seroconversion, worldwide, many more infants with CCMV are born to women who are already seropositive, and most are not diagnosed, with no access to treatment.

Initial categorization of infants with CCMV as clinically 'symptomatic' or 'asymptomatic' at birth predated newborn hearing screening and brain imaging; a significant proportion of infants who examine normally at birth may have SNHL and/or abnormal findings on brain MRI. Clinical follow-up should continue until school age to identify late-onset and progressive SNHL, and other neurodevelopmental sequelae, but studies with this length of follow-up are limited.

Economic costs of CCMV are high, including lifelong support for children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy, as well as cochlear implantation for profound SNHL, although costs are more difficult to assess for those less severely affected. Recent studies suggest that universal neonatal screening is more cost-effective than targeted testing to reduce CCMV-related sequelae. Although the foetal effects of CCMV can be mitigated by treatment after birth, they cannot be cured like congenital syphilis, or fully suppressed like HIV. As for these other prevalent congenital infections, the best way to protect infants from CCMV is to prevent vertical transmission. Here, we review recent evidence across primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of CCMV disease (Fig. 2).

TERTIARY PREVENTION: LIMITATION OF SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF CONGENITAL CYTOMEGALOVIRUS DISEASE

Two randomized controlled trials of ganciclovir/valganciclovir demonstrated a significant reduction in progressive and late-onset hearing loss, and improvement in developmental outcomes in symptomatic infants born more than 32 weeks gestation, birthweight greater than 1.8 kg, initiating therapy at less than 1 month of age. Treating early makes biological sense, as treatment is more likely to be beneficial during immunological immaturity of early infancy when there is reduced ability to control CMV, and indeed, makes the case for treatment in utero with antenatal diagnosis. In a more recent nonrandomised study in the Netherlands, children born at term (≥ 37 weeks) with normal birthweight, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss (≥ 21 dB), and diagnosed with cCMV through targeted screening incorporated into the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme without prior clinical suspicion, had the option of initiating valganciclovir up to 13 weeks of age. Whether to initiate treatment was determined by parental choice; children receiving 6 weeks of valganciclovir had reduced subsequent hearing loss up to 20 months of age, as compared with a control group (those who chose nontreatment and historical controls). However, a small randomised study of 6 weeks valganciclovir versus placebo for children diagnosed with CCMV and SNHL aged 1 month to 3 years of age (up to their fourth birthday) did not demonstrate improved hearing outcomes 6 months later. Small and heterogeneous study populations, complexities of audiological testing, and short and incomplete follow-up, are among the methodological issues that complicate interpretation of these and many CCMV studies.

Early treatment initiation depends on early diagnosis, and screening studies have shown that even infants symptomatic at birth can be clinically missed. Barriers to universal screening include: uncertainty regarding whether screening tests will identify those most at risk of long-term neurodevelopmental and hearing problems; whether asymptomatic infants require treatment or not; and whether the investigation of asymptomatic infants leads to undue cost and parental anxiety. In Ontario, these concerns have been closely examined, and subsequent to the pilot study, universal neonatal screening will continue.

In the absence of universal screening, targeted CMV testing of high-risk groups less than 3 weeks of age is an alternative approach including: premature infants; HIV-exposed; infants with growth restriction; or infants who have failed new-born hearing screening. However, this relies upon HCPs' awareness and local policies, and there is considerable disparity in service delivery.

Some healthcare providers hold or delay vaccination because of false vaccine contraindications. This study suggests that in 21.4% of scenarios (877/4096) physicians would postpone or contraindicate the vaccination, and 24.2% (237/978) of scenarios would be vaccinated despite the existence of a true contraindication or reason for delay. Addressing false contraindications may result in increasing vaccination uptake in Europe.

### Choice of study populations for vaccines [^116vRmHd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The natural history of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is complex. Individuals may experience primary infection, reactivation of latent infection, or reinfection with a new strain despite natural immunity. The ability of this virus to continue to replicate despite substantial immune responses is attributable to the many immune evasion genes encoded within its genome. Given this complex natural history and immunology, the design of clinical trials of CMV vaccines may require components not usually found in trials of vaccines designed to protect against viruses that cause only acute infections. In this article, we focus on specific aspects of clinical trial design that could be adopted to address the complexities of CMV infections. We consider women of childbearing age, toddlers, recipients of solid organ transplantation, and stem cell transplant patients, emphasizing the parallels between women and solid organ transplantation that could allow vaccines to be developed in parallel in both these patient groups. We emphasize the potential for studies of passive immunity to inform the selection of immunogens as candidates for active immunization and vice versa. We also illustrate how application of whole-genomic sequencing could document whether vaccines protect against reactivation or reinfection of CMV or both.

### Decoding human cytomegalovirus for the development of innovative diagnostics to detect congenital infection [^113jtPjr]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus is the most common cause of congenital infectious disease and the leading nongenetic etiology of sensorineural hearing loss. Although most infected neonates are asymptomatic at birth, congenital cytomegalovirus infection is responsible for nearly 400 infant deaths annually in the United States and may lead to significant long-term neurodevelopmental impairments in survivors. The resulting financial and social burdens of congenital cytomegalovirus infection have led many medical centers to initiate targeted testing after birth, with a growing advocacy to advance universal newborn screening. While no cures or vaccines are currently available to eliminate or prevent cytomegalovirus infection, much has been learned over the last five years regarding disease pathophysiology and viral replication cycles that may enable the development of innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. This Review will detail our current understanding of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, while focusing our discussion on routine and emerging diagnostics for viral detection, quantification, and long-term prognostication. IMPACT: This review highlights our current understanding of the fetal transmission of human cytomegalovirus. It details clinical signs and physical findings of congenital cytomegalovirus infection. This submission discusses currently available cytomegalovirus diagnostics and introduces emerging platforms that promise improved sensitivity, specificity, limit of detection, viral quantification, detection of genomic antiviral resistance, and infection staging (primary, latency, reactivation, reinfection).

### TORCH test for fetal medicine indications: only CMV is necessary in the United Kingdom [^113CetE9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the indications and value of TORCH testing (toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes) for fetal medicine reasons.

Methods

Analysis of all maternal and fetal TORCH tests requested from a busy Fetal Medicine Unit during nearly a 10-year period. The main ultrasound findings considered as possibly caused by congenital fetal infections were analysed. Pregnancy outcomes for cases with confirmed maternal or fetal infections were studied.

Results

Four hundred and sixty-two maternal TORCH tests were performed. Of those, TORCH tests were also performed on fetal samples (amniotic fluid or fetal blood) in 67 cases. Fourteen fetal tests without maternal testing were identified, making the total number of patients tested 476. There were 11 cases of maternal CMV infection (2.3%), 10 cases of fetal CMV infection, and none of the other viruses. Indications for testing included fetal hyperechogenic bowel, hydrops, cerebral ventriculomegaly, echogenic foci, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, and IUGR. The most common findings to be actually associated with fetal infections were hyperechogenic bowel, ascites, cardiomegaly, and oligohydramnios. No cases were associated with polyhydramnious, while both IUGR and ventriculomegaly were always associated with other more relevant features.

Conclusion

In the United Kingdom, complete maternal TORCH testing because of fetal findings on detailed scans is often not necessary. Testing can be limited only to CMV, particularly since other infectious agents, including toxoplasmosis, are uncommon in the United Kingdom. More understanding of the relevance of the different ultrasound features to congenital infections is also important.

### Mother-to-child transmission of cytomegalovirus and prevention of congenital infection [^111ELxLy]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) occurs transplacentally (congenital infection), during birth and through breast milk, although the latter 2 modes of transmission are not associated with the central nervous system sequelae that occur with congenital infection. CMV persists indefinitely in its human host, and MTCT can occur if the mother was infected in the past or during the current pregnancy. The goal of efforts to prevent MTCT of CMV is to prevent congenital infection, an important cause of disability due to hearing loss, impaired vision, cognitive impairment, and neuromotor deficits. Vaccines for prevention of maternal and congenital CMV infection are being developed but will not likely be available for at least a decade. Rather than waiting for an effective vaccine to solve the problem, more effort must be devoted to defining the potential for public health measures to prevent congenital CMV infection by reducing rates of maternal infection during pregnancy.

### Current status of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a call to action [^116kNyAr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Ganciclovir/valganciclovir remains unlicensed for treatment of cCMV in neonates. Evidence-based rationale for treatment is essential, particularly in LMICs where rates of CCMV are higher and side-effect monitoring challenging. Neutropenia and transaminitis occur in up to 46% of treated term and preterm infants, and animal data implies potential risk of teratogenicity and carcinogenesis. Important treatment issues, which remain to be addressed include: optimal duration of treatment; dosing for premature infants with CCMV; best treatment for infants with HIV and CCMV; and how to improve treatment outcomes while minimizing side effects. Alternative approaches to be evaluated could include, valganciclovir to suppress CMV, followed by antivirals with less toxicity to maintain suppression.

The value of psychological support for families in managing an unexpected and life-changing newborn diagnosis, and the challenges that lie ahead managing a child with disability, should not be overlooked. A holistic approach informed by the lived experience of families affected by CCMV, and including integrated clinical psychology support, will ultimately improve clinical, developmental and socio-emotional outcomes for the child and family.

### Vaccines in pregnancy [^11751Ye4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The concept of maternal immunization to prevent infectious diseases during a period of increased vulnerability in the infant is supported by historical experience and carefully conducted studies of various viral and bacterial vaccines. Candidate vaccines should be minimally reactogenic, immunogenic, and safe. Health education and access to immunization should be a priority if maternal immunization is to succeed as a disease prevention strategy. The potential effect on the incidence of disease in the newborn and young infant can only increase as more candidate vaccines that could be administered during pregnancy become available. In the future, common infections and other, more dreaded diseases, such as herpes simplex virus infection, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus infection, could be prevented with this intervention. Further research on the safety and efficacy of maternal immunization must continue if the occurrence of serious infectious diseases in neonates and young infants is to be reduced.

### Animal models of congenital cytomegalovirus transmission: implications for vaccine development [^111Zxa5b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are species-specific, the study of nonhuman CMVs in animal models can help to inform and direct research aimed at developing a human CMV (HCMV) vaccine. Because the driving force behind the development of HCMV vaccines is to prevent congenital infection, the animal model in question must be one in which vertical transmission of virus occurs to the fetus. Fortunately, two such animal models-the rhesus macaque CMV and guinea pig CMV-are characterized by congenital infection. Hence, each model can be evaluated in "proof-of-concept" studies of preconception vaccination aimed at blocking transplacental transmission. This review focuses on similarities and differences in the respective model systems, and it discusses key insights from each model germane to the study of HCMV vaccines.

### TORCH screening used appropriately in China? ─ three years results from a teaching hospital in northwest China [^115RQaUq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

TORCH infections, which also called perinatal or congenital infections, are caused by serial organisms during pregnancy with an acronym TORCH, which named Toxoplasma gondii (TOX), Other (hepatitis viruses, parvovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, syphilis), Rubella virus (RV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). The diagnosis and management of other TORCH infections, i.e. hepatitis viruses, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus, are clear and highly efficacious. However, most of the TORCH infections, such as TOX, RV, CMV and HSV, which are easily overlooked and difficult to diagnose due to be often asymptomatic and relatively low virulence, may lead to serious fetal consequences, i.e. abortions, intrauterine foetal deaths, congenital malformations. Therefore, early recognition these TORCH infections are important for treatment and prevention strategies to avoid adverse fetal outcomes.

Up to present, only CMV and HSV-2 PCR tests were approved for clinical practice by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). Therefore, the serological evidences through detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against TORCH agents are the preferred approaches for identification of these infections in China. The present study was carried out to investigate the application and epidemiological characteristics of TOX, RV, CMV and HSV screening in reproductive age women from Xi'an region, China.

Results

The epidemiological characteristics and application of TORCH test

During the study period, 18,104 reproductive age women (20–44 years) were included. The test numbers in 2015, 2016 and 2017 were 4953, 6387 and 6764, respectively. The age-specific distributions of the population were 14.69% for 20–25 years, 53.88% for 26–30 years and 31.43% for ≥ 31 years. The habitual abortion, infertility and spontaneous abortion accounted for the majority of the women with bad obstetric history (BOH) (56.89, 27.77 and 12.46%, respectively).

In the study, 51.66, 20.44, 24.08 and 3.83% of the women performed TORCH screening in the pre-gestation period, the first, second and third trimester, respectively. The woman attached importance to both IgM and IgG antibodies of TORCH agents in the first and second trimester, with a proportion of 89.11 and 80.06%. However, less than half of the women in the third trimester (44.30%) and with BOH (40.74%) tested both IgM and IgG antibodies. Meanwhile, 29.74% of the pre-gestation women and 18.94% of pregnant women only screened IgM antibody. With age increased, the attention to IgG antibody test decreased, Table 1.

### Zika virus as a new pathogenic agent within the toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex (TORCH) virus family: where do we stand? [^115thKD2]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral infections in low-income countries such as Brazil pose a significant challenge for medical authorities, with epidemics such as Zika virus infection having lasting effects. The increase in microcephaly among newborns has prompted investigations into the association between Zika virus and this congenital syndrome. The severity and prevalence of microcephaly led to the declaration of national and international emergencies. Extensive research has been conducted to understand the teratogenic effects of Zika virus, particularly its impact on neural progenitor cells in the fetal brain. Various pre- and postnatal imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and postnatal computed tomography (CT), have played crucial roles in diagnosing and monitoring malformations linked to congenital Zika virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS). These modalities can detect brain parenchymal abnormalities, calcifications, cerebral atrophy, and callosal anomalies. Additionally, three-dimensional ultrasound and fetal MRI provide detailed anatomical images, while CT can identify calcifications that are not easily detected by other methods. Despite advancements in imaging, there are still unanswered questions and ongoing challenges in comprehending the long-term effects and developmental impairments in children affected by Zika virus. Radiologists continue to play a crucial role in diagnosing and assisting in the management of these cases.

### Current evidence gaps to support systematic cytomegalovirus screening in pregnancy [^111hSvMf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Is congenital cytomegalovirus infection a public health issue?

At the individual level, congenital cytomegalovirus infection can be severe, due to sensorineural impairment and serious sequelae. Congenital cytomegalovirus infections could be the cause of up to 6% of childhood hearing losses. At the population level, however, severe consequences of cytomegalovirus infection are infrequent(between 1 and 6 sequelae/100,000 new-borns in France), as most neonates infected with cytomegalovirus in utero will present with no clinical sequelae, whether at birth or afterwards, in infancy and childhood. In studies based on representative databases, the frequency of sequelae seems lower, even when considering terminations of pregnancy. Concurrently to increased efforts towards general hygiene measures, especially during pregnancy, maternal seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus infection and the incidence of MPIs have decreased. Uncertainties remain regarding the risk of reinfection/reactivation in women who have been infected with cytomegalovirus prior to their pregnancy. This situation accounts for half of pregnant women in France. Sequelae have the same frequency and severity in these situations as when the infection of the new-born results from a MPI.,

Were all cost-effective primary prevention interventions fully implemented?

Because screening is a secondary prevention intervention aimed at reducing the severity of the consequences of the infection, it should only be considered once all available primary prevention interventions have been implemented. Vaccine trials are ongoing; the development of one vaccine was recently stopped for lack of efficacy, while another candidate shows promising perspectives. General hygiene measures are effective to reduce the incidence of all infections, including cytomegalovirus during pregnancy. Promoting these hygiene measures was one of the main recommendations of the HCSP in 2018. Despite the introduction of some information tools, only a minority of pregnant women report having been informed that hygiene measures limit cytomegalovirus transmission.

### Zika virus-reigniting the TORCH [^1153XaHr]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2016). Medium credibility.

The recent association between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and fetal microcephaly has led to a renewed interest in the mechanisms by which vertically transmitted microorganisms reach the fetus and cause congenital disease. In this Opinion article, we provide an overview of the structure and cellular composition of the human placenta and of the mechanisms by which traditional 'TORCH' pathogens (Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) access the fetal compartment. Based on our current understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis and the developmental defects that are caused by fetal ZIKV infection, ZIKV should be considered a TORCH pathogen and future research and public health measures should be planned and implemented accordingly.

### The importance of detecting cytomegalovirus infections in studies evaluating new therapies for severe sepsis [^112vmWvF]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus infection is present in the majority of the population and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Recently, this viral infection has also been reported in nonimmunocompromised critically ill patients. We hypothesize that active cytomegalovirus infection may confound survival outcomes in severe sepsis trials. Scenarios based on three published studies on activated protein C were used as real examples for statistical simulations looking for how much bias in favor of or against activated protein C would be observed in single-arm studies (scenario 1), phase II trials (scenario 2A/2B), and phase III trials (scenario 3A/3B). Scenario 1 simulations evaluated a single-arm study and demonstrated that confounding biases could cause an absolute decrease of 5.7% to an increase of 6.1% on mortality rates of similar studies. Scenarios 2A and 3A evaluated phase II and III trials assuming that activated protein C is truly effective; they showed that trials with an imbalance on the proportion of active cytomegalovirus infection between study arms could lead to false-negative rates (β errors) in up to 25% of phase II trials and up to 42% of phase III trials. Scenarios 2B and 3B assumed that activated protein C was truly ineffective; they showed that imbalanced cytomegalovirus infection between arms would cause false-positive rates (α errors) in up to 5% of phase II and up to 7% of all phase III trials. The inclusion of an imbalanced proportion of patients with active cytomegalovirus infection may severely compromise the reliability of outcome results of severe sepsis trials independent of their design. Even randomized trials could have a much higher probability of false-negative rates for a new therapy than designed. Future severe sepsis trials should consider including active cytomegalovirus infection as a prospective covariate.

### Screening, prevention, and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus [^1135sE4S]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a leading cause of permanent disability in children. The main source of maternal infection is from contact with young children. Primary maternal infection is diagnosed with demonstration of seroconversion or a positive CMV IgM in combination with a low-avidity CMV IgG. Fetal infection may be diagnosed with amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction and culture. CMV-specific hyperimmune globulin has shown promise as a possible means to prevent congenital infection; large randomized trials are ongoing. To date, the only effective means of prevention is through reducing exposure to the virus. Rates of maternal infection may be reduced through education regarding sources of infection and improved hygiene.

### Questions&answers for the 2025 CDC training for vaccine-preventable disease surveillance… [^113oXzc6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Q: Why do so many mumps outbreaks occur in fully vaccinated adults. A: The mumps component of the MMR vaccine has lower vaccine effectiveness than the measles and rubella components, about 72% for 1 dose and 86% for 2 doses, with some documented waning of immunity. Additionally, the circulating strain of mumps in the US is typically genotype G, while the mumps vaccine strain used in the MMR/MMRV vaccines is genotype A. Thus, it is thought that both waning of immunity and antigenic mismatch contribute to cases of mumps occurring in fully vaccinated individuals. Rotavirus Q: Is rotavirus a nationally notifiable vaccine preventable disease. A: No, rotavirus gastroenteritis is not a nationally notifiable disease in the U. S.

Instead, estimates of disease burden are made through various surveillance mechanisms, including laboratory-based sentinel surveillance, healthcare utilization datasets such as hospital discharge data, and more intensive active, population-based surveillance at some sentinel sites. Meningococcal disease Q: Is decreased vaccination coverage during the pandemic causing the increase in meningococcal disease cases. A: No, the increase in meningococcal disease cases is being driven primarily by serogroup Y sequence type 1466, and the majority of those cases are 30 to 60 years of age. This age group is not routinely recommended to receive meningococcal vaccine. Q: Based on preliminary data so far, did the number of meningococcal disease cases increase during 2024. A: Yes, we did see increases in meningococcal disease in 2024, due to both serogroup Y ST-1466 cases and ciprofloxacin resistant cases.

We are asking that health departments continue to timely submit isolates to CDC as part of enhanced surveillance, to monitor for ciprofloxacin resistance and to inform potential changes to prophylaxis. C. diphtheriae bacteria. This means fully vaccinated people can have C. diphtheriae infection, including with a toxigenic strain, without developing diphtheria because the vaccine protects them against diphtheria toxin. Simply put, diphtheria is a vaccine preventable disease, C. diphtheriae infection is not.
