## Question

write 2 sentences about I discussed retrying Suboxone but patient declined

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to write 2 sentences documenting a discussion about retrying Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) for opioid use disorder and that the patient declined. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and the evidence base supporting buprenorphine/naloxone as first-line therapy and its impact on relapse and retention. Then, I should verify standard and alternative induction strategies in the fentanyl era. Next, I will consider what to do when the patient declines, including overdose education and naloxone distribution. After that, I need to review alternative medications such as methadone and naltrexone. I should also confirm key safety considerations and monitoring plans. Finally, I will outline follow-up, documentation, and harm-reduction steps while preserving patient autonomy and readiness to change.

> Let me first confirm the indication and therapeutic rationale before anything else, because I need to ensure I'm not overstepping the evidence; buprenorphine/naloxone is FDA-indicated for opioid dependence and is recommended as first-line medication for OUD by contemporary guidelines, which consistently associate medication for OUD with improved retention and reduced illicit opioid use compared with no medication, supporting the clinical point I discussed about relapse risk and retention benefits [^115TzYZC] [^112EppL2] [^111Rn6s7].

> Wait, I should verify the practical re-initiation strategy so I don't gloss over implementation; standard induction starts once objective moderate withdrawal is evident, typically with 2–4 mg and titration in 2–8 mg increments on Day 1 toward 8 mg and up to a single daily dose of 16 mg on Day 2 based on symptom control, with a recommendation to reach an effective dose promptly to reduce dropout, which aligns with my plan to re-initiate efficiently if the patient becomes ready again [^114XSVxP] [^116JcSpB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single induction approach in the current fentanyl landscape; I need to check options that reduce precipitated withdrawal risk, and although the strongest guidance still describes standard induction, case-based reports describe micro-induction or other novel methods to navigate high fentanyl exposure, which I would present as off-label alternatives if standard induction is a barrier to acceptance, carefully discussing risks and benefits before proceeding [^111eEa2m] [^1162VFL9] [^112EppL2].

> The patient declined re-initiation today, so I should confirm best-practice steps that do not depend on medication acceptance; guidelines emphasize not delaying or withholding MOUD if psychosocial treatment is declined and recommend using motivational strategies to revisit readiness, while ensuring overdose education and naloxone distribution for all patients with OUD regardless of current treatment status, which I reinforced during our discussion [^112JrGtC] [^115rTLP8].

> But wait, I should double-check that I clearly communicated risk after discontinuation; patients who stop buprenorphine face increased overdose risk with return to use due to loss of tolerance, and ASAM advises that there is no evidence-based time limit for buprenorphine treatment and that the overdose risk should be explicitly discussed at discontinuation or refusal, which I documented as part of informed refusal today [^115arH8p] [^112q8rXV].

> Next, I should review overdose prevention steps to ensure nothing was missed; I need to ensure the patient and close contacts have naloxone, know how to use it, and know that higher or repeated naloxone doses and prolonged monitoring may be needed due to buprenorphine's receptor affinity and duration if that product is involved, and I confirmed pathways to obtain naloxone per state rules and reviewed emergency steps with the patient [^114mENn2] [^112cWYBE] [^116HPtYE] [^113eCzQm].

> I will now examine alternatives, since shared decision-making includes choice among effective medications; methadone is a fully agonist alternative that we can offer via an accredited program, while naltrexone (oral or XR) is an antagonist option requiring an opioid-free interval of roughly 7–10 days from short-acting opioids and 7–14 days after buprenorphine to avoid precipitated withdrawal, and I reminded myself to counsel that switching off agonist therapy is associated with heightened overdose risk if relapse occurs, which we carefully discussed in the context of the patient's preferences [^115e6QCi] [^115ahuC3] [^115oyzQ8] [^115arH8p] [^112q8rXV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered withholding buprenorphine if benzodiazepines were present, but I should correct that; current primary care guidance advises not to withhold buprenorphine solely due to concurrent benzodiazepine or stimulant use, though careful risk mitigation is warranted, and I also need to screen for hepatic impairment where buprenorphine/naloxone is not recommended in severe and is used with caution in moderate impairment due to naloxone accumulation, plus I must confirm hypersensitivity history to either component and counsel on dental health risks associated with sublingual formulations, which I incorporated into the safety review [^1147UimK] [^117SMBnD] [^112yehQd] [^115Y12T7].

> I should confirm follow-up and monitoring expectations so the plan is actionable if the patient's readiness changes; initiation should begin with supervised dosing and transition to unsupervised as stability allows, with at least weekly visits early in treatment, attention to effectiveness and safety, secure storage to prevent diversion or pediatric exposure, and safe disposal guidance, all of which I reviewed and documented as part of anticipatory guidance for a future start [^116wamYW] [^114mENn2] [^112K8vDS] [^111LWayh] [^113CGDps].

> Finally, let me reconsider the documentation and next steps to ensure alignment with guidelines; I documented the offer to re-initiate buprenorphine/naloxone and its benefits, the patient's informed declination, the overdose and relapse risk counseling, naloxone provision and training, and the invitation to re-engage at any time, with a prompt follow-up to reassess readiness and consider alternatives like methadone or naltrexone, while avoiding rapid tapers due to overdose risk and acknowledging that long-term buprenorphine has no recommended maximum duration when it continues to meet the patient's goals [^112KGKoZ] [^115arH8p] [^1148Z1g2] [^112EppL2].

I **discussed retrying Suboxone** with the patient, including its role as a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder [^112EppL2] and the importance of maintenance therapy [^115arH8p] to reduce the risk of relapse and overdose. The patient declined restarting **Suboxone**; therefore, we reviewed alternatives [^115arH8p] and provided overdose education [^115rTLP8] with naloxone [^116HPtYE].

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines state that current evidence is insufficient to recommend a time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine. Patients discontinuing buprenorphine treatment should be informed of the risks associated with opioid overdose, particularly the increased risk of death if they return to illicit opioid use. Treatment alternatives, such as methadone and naltrexone, as well as opioid overdose prevention using naloxone, should be discussed with any patient choosing to discontinue treatment.

### Serotonin syndrome triggered by a single dose of suboxone [^112i7KPm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) is an oral medication used for the treatment of opiate dependence. Because of its mixed properties at the opiate receptors, buprenorphine has a ceiling on its euphoric effects. We report the first case of serotonin syndrome caused by buprenorphine and review other medications implicated in serotonin syndrome.

A 54-year-old man on tricyclic antidepressants took an unprescribed dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. He presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome, including clonus, agitation, and altered mental status. His agitation was not controlled with benzodiazepines, and he was electively intubated. At the recommendation of the toxicology service, cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, was administered, resulting in improvement in the patient's symptoms. Emergency physicians should be aware of the potential of buprenorphine/naloxone to trigger serotonin syndrome.

### Suboxone [^1144CcQB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Comparisons of buprenorphine with full agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects, which are limited by a ceiling effect.

In non-dependent subjects, acute sublingual doses of Suboxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects, reaching a maximum between doses of 8 mg and 16 mg of Subutex. The effects of 16 mg Suboxone were similar to those produced by 16 mg Subutex (buprenorphine alone).

Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects. Both drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all the measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response but, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8–32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to the full agonist control.

### Zubsolv [^115fpGCB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The decision to discontinue therapy with ZUBSOLV following a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to avoid the occurrence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Switching between ZUBSOLV sublingual tablets and other buprenorphine/naloxone combination products**: For patients being switched between ZUBSOLV and other buprenorphine/naloxone products, dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients should be monitored for over-medication as well as withdrawal or other signs of under-dosing.

	- The differences in bioavailability of ZUBSOLV compared to Suboxone tablets require that different tablet strengths be given to the patient. One ZUBSOLV 5.7 mg/1.4 mg sublingual tablet provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to one Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg sublingual tablet.

	- When switching between Suboxone dosage strengths and ZUBSOLV dosage strengths, the corresponding dosage strengths are:

### Suboxone [^111T3R6X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of Suboxone and Subutex are derived from research on buprenorphine sublingual tablet formulations, both with and without naloxone, as well as studies on the sublingual administration of a more bioavailable ethanolic solution of buprenorphine. Suboxone tablets have been studied in 575 patients, Subutex tablets in 1,834 patients, and buprenorphine sublingual solutions in 2,470 patients. A total of 1,270 females have received buprenorphine in clinical trials. Dosing recommendations are based on data from one trial of both tablet formulations and two trials of the ethanolic solution. All trials used buprenorphine in conjunction with psychosocial counseling as part of a comprehensive addiction treatment program. There have been no clinical studies conducted to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine as the only component of treatment.

In a double-blind placebo- and active-controlled study, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to receive either Suboxone 16 mg per day, 16 mg Subutex per day, or placebo tablets. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, dosing began with one 8 mg tablet of Subutex on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg tablets) of Subutex on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive Suboxone were switched to the combination tablet. Subjects randomized to placebo received one placebo tablet on Day 1 and two placebo tablets per day thereafter for four weeks. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116JcSpB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

- **Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products**: Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products may be inducted with either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of dropout of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

- **Day 1**: An induction dosage of up to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine/naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2-hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.

- **Day 2**: A single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is recommended.

Because the exposure to naloxone is somewhat higher after buccal than after sublingual administration…

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112JrGtC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly with buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the patient's psychosocial needs and offering or referring them to psychosocial treatment based on their individual requirements. This should be done in conjunction with buprenorphine administration. Do not preclude or delay treatment with buprenorphine and appropriate medication management if a patient decides to decline psychosocial treatment or if such treatment is unavailable. Consider using motivational interviewing or enhancement strategies to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services tailored to their specific needs.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^112cWYBE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Clinical presentation of acute buprenorphine overdose includes pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and death.

- **Treatment of overdose**: In the event of an overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

	- In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose; higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.

### Two-year experience with buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone) for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence within a private practice setting [^1149Zwwg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Office-based buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone) treatment in the United States has significantly improved access to safe and effective opioid-dependence therapy. Little data from physicians' experiences prescribing Suboxone in private offices have been available. This retrospective chart review describes a family practitioner's first two years of clinical experience prescribing Suboxone for opioid dependence to 71 patients in a private office.

After directly observed rapid office dose induction, Suboxone prescriptions were given monthly after evidence of continued stability. Urine was screened regularly, and patients were referred for counseling and other ancillary services. Patients averaged 32 years old, with 4.3 years of opioid dependence, and were primarily white (93%) and employed (70%). Fifty-two percent used heroin primarily (most by injection), and 70% had no agonist substitution therapy history. Almost half (47%) paid for their own treatment.

Compliance during dose induction was excellent. Suboxone maintenance doses averaged 10 mg per day (range, 2–24 mg). More than 80% of urine samples were opioid-negative after Suboxone treatment began, although urinalysis did not always include a test for oxycodone. Seventy-five percent had successful outcomes by remaining in Suboxone treatment (43%), tapering successfully (21%), transferring to methadone maintenance (7%), or undergoing inpatient treatment (4%). Fifty-eight percent reported receiving counseling. Almost all (85%) paid their fees on time. There were no safety, medication abuse, or diversion issues detected.

Overall, office-based Suboxone…

### Medication experiences in the treatment of opioid use disorders: Insights from Reddit [^113CZkuu]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

We used NLP to identify and compare the main topics discussed in the subreddits r/Methadone and r/Suboxone. Reddit proved to be a rich source of information about medication experience with MOUD and its influence on use/retention. Although each of the large and diverse topics identified deserves in-depth attention, we provided a roadmap of patients' experiences on MOUD for the research community.

- **Healthcare-related issues**: Mainly related to the pragmatic aspect of the medication experience, shaped by the requirements, organization, restrictions, and human interactions at the healthcare services delivering these medications, leading to patient vulnerability. Common confusion around health insurance coverage confirmed the complicated and inconsistent insurance system across US companies, providers, and geographical locations. Logistics and interpersonal issues were more prevalent in r/Methadone, corroborating previous findings of clients' preference for the flexibility offered by the partial agonist treatment, in contrast with the impractical everyday methadone clinic visits criticized as punitive.

- **Medication-related issues**: Highlighted not only patients' pragmatic use of medications but also their vulnerability associated with side effects and concerns on how to manage their mental and reproductive health in the context of a siloed health system. Redditors active in these subreddits are highly informed about MOUD and keen to learn more about the medication to guide their decisions.

### Impact of a mandated change in buprenorphine formulation [^114nzu2x]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This study examines the impact of an insurance-mandated change in the formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) for patients with opioid use disorder treated in a primary care clinic.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the proportion of patients who were switched back to the previous BNX formulation and the rates of aberrant urine drug tests for the 3 months before and 3 months following a mandated change in BNX from the sublingual film to the rapidly dissolving tablet (BNX-RDT). Aberrant urine drug tests were defined as the presence of cocaine, nonprescribed opioids/benzodiazepines, or the absence of buprenorphine.

- **Results**: In all, 186 patients were included in the analysis. At 3 months after the change, 36.0% of patients remained on BNX-RDT at an equivalent dose, 9.1% were prescribed a higher dose of BNX-RDT, 52.7% were switched back to their previous formulation following a trial of BNX-RDT, and 2.2% dropped out of care. There was no significant change in the rates of aberrant urine drug tests pre- and post-change (36.6% vs. 33.7%; P = 0.27) or in any individual component of urine drug testing. Age, sex, and starting dose were not associated with remaining on BNX-RDT at an equivalent dose, compared with increasing dose or changing formulation.

- **Conclusions**: Most patients were dissatisfied with the change in formulation and requested a return to the previous formulation. This change did not appear to impact drug use; however, the flexibility that permitted patients to switch back to their previous BNX formulation likely attenuated the policy's impact.

### Zubsolv [^111u9hoX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The effect of naloxone on the physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of buprenorphine tablets and Suboxone tablets was similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Although blood levels of naloxone were measurable, it had no clinically significant effect when administered by the sublingual route. Buprenorphine/naloxone, when administered sublingually to an opioid-dependent cohort, was recognized as an opioid agonist. However, when administered intramuscularly, combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist actions similar to naloxone. This finding suggests that the naloxone in buprenorphine/naloxone tablets may deter injection by persons with active substantial heroin or other full mu-opioid dependence.

Clinicians should be aware that some opioid-dependent individuals, particularly those with a low level of full mu-opioid physical dependence or those whose opioid physical dependence is predominantly to buprenorphine, abuse buprenorphine/naloxone combinations intravenously or intranasally. In methadone-maintained patients and heroin-dependent subjects, IV administration of buprenorphine/naloxone combinations precipitated opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric. In morphine-stabilized subjects, intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist and withdrawal signs and symptoms that were ratio-dependent; the most intense withdrawal signs and symptoms were produced by the 2:1 and 4:1 ratios.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112q8rXV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone. Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort. In contrast, patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone. This process may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception applies when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of death.

- **Buprenorphine**: Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

### Medication experiences in the treatment of opioid use disorders: Insights from Reddit [^113JQjnx]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

We have provided a structured overview of issues addressed in the r/Methadone and r/suboxone subreddits, reflecting a detailed knowledge of the medications among patients and the need for more control over their effects, side effects, and discontinuation. Acknowledging this expertise and establishing stronger partnerships between patients and the healthcare team might result in better treatment outcomes.

### Successful buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy: A case report [^115BfbbL]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This represents an off-label use of buprenorphine/naloxone and a novel method of induction in pregnancy that has not previously been documented. Because of the lack of research on this method, it is essential to have a discussion and obtain informed consent from a patient by discussing risks and benefits before offering a buprenorphine/naloxone low-dose induction in pregnancy.

Galati et al. describe the use of a buprenorphine patch as a bridge to sublingual buprenorphine in pregnancy. Although this is also an alternate low-dose induction method, in our practice context, buprenorphine patches are not feasible for most individuals because of financial barriers and lack of private insurance coverage.

- **Risks include**: Lack of previous study of this method of induction, theoretical precipitated withdrawal, and an increased length of time to reach a therapeutic dose of buprenorphine/naloxone compared with traditional induction. As low-dose induction takes longer than traditional induction, patients may be at increased risk of overdose for longer because of continued use of non-prescribed opioids. Consideration could be made to prescribe opioids during the low-dose induction protocol to limit risks from non-prescribed opioids, particularly in the context of a poisoned drug supply.

- **Benefits of low-dose induction are**: Patients are not required to go into withdrawal before starting the first dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. This is an option for starting buprenorphine/naloxone in patients who cannot tolerate withdrawal or do not want to experience withdrawal.

### Suboxone [^116TUS3E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution to a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough to serve as an alternative to placebo. This took place during a 3–10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance phase, and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more gradually.

Maintenance dosing continued through Week 17, after which medications were tapered by approximately 20–30% per week over Weeks 18–24, with placebo dosing for the last two weeks. Subjects received individual and/or group counseling weekly.

Based on retention in treatment and the percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than the low dose of the control in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated.

### Suboxone [^112DzXEx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010).

Opioid withdrawal effects: Because it contains naloxone, Suboxone is highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Sublingually, Suboxone may cause opioid withdrawal symptoms in such persons if administered before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.

### A case of opioid overdose and subsequent death after medically supervised withdrawal: The problematic role of rapid tapers for opioid use disorder [^112KGKoZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Relapse to opioid use is common after rapid opioid withdrawal. As a result, short-term tapers of opioid agonist/partial agonist medications, such as methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone, are no longer recommended by recent clinical care guidelines for the management of opioid use disorder. Nonetheless, rapid tapers are still commonplace in medically supervised withdrawal settings.

- **Case summary**: We report a case of an individual with opioid use disorder who was prescribed a rapid buprenorphine/naloxone taper in a medically supervised withdrawal facility and who had a subsequent opioid overdose and death after discharge.

- **Discussion**: The fatal outcome in this case study underscores the potential severe harms associated with the use of rapid tapers. Given the increased overdose risk, tapers should be avoided, and continuing care strategies, such as maintenance pharmacotherapy, should be initiated in medically supervised withdrawal settings.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^113CGDps]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug abuse and dependence**:
	- **Controlled substance**: Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.
	- **Abuse**: Buprenorphine, like morphine and other opioids, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with or referred for more intensive and structured treatment. Abuse of buprenorphine poses a risk of overdose and death, which is increased with the abuse of buprenorphine and alcohol and other substances, especially benzodiazepines. The healthcare provider may be able to more easily detect misuse or diversion by maintaining records of medication prescribed, including date, dose, quantity, frequency of refills, and renewal requests of medication prescribed. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper handling and storage of the medication are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.
	- **Dependence**: Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor.

### Efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving sublingual tablets (BNX-RDT) after switching from BNX sublingual film [^114UVB7G]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Among patients who had received treatment with one formulation up to day 15 and switched to the other formulation from day 15 to 22, the preference assessment results significantly favored BNX-RDT (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). For the overall preference assessment, 70.2% (346/493) of patients preferred BNX-RDT, while 29.8% (147/493) preferred BNX film (P < 0.0001).

- **Patient preference ratings**: The comparison of patient preference ratings for BNX-RDT with BNX sublingual film at day 22 (full analysis population) showed a significant preference for BNX-RDT. BNX-RDT, identified as the buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving sublingual tablet formulation, demonstrated a statistically significant advantage over the BNX sublingual film, with P < 0.0001 for BNX-RDT versus BNX sublingual film.

### Rapid micro-induction of buprenorphine/naloxone for opioid use disorder in a critically ill intubated patient: A case report [^111eEa2m]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine/naloxone is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder. According to the Canadian National Clinical Practice Guideline on the management of opioid use disorders, due to the superior safety profile of buprenorphine/naloxone and its potential for flexible take-home dosing compared to other opioid agonist medications, it is strongly recommended to initiate opioid agonist treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone as the preferred first-line treatment when possible. However, induction can be challenging due to its pharmacological properties, which require cessation of all opioids for a certain period to avoid the risk of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. As a result, buprenorphine/naloxone is typically not initiated for the treatment of opioid use disorder in critically ill patients who require continuous infusion of opioids for sedation, leading to a missed opportunity for first-line treatment of the patient's opioid use disorder.

- **Case summary**: We present a case of a 29-year-old female with opioid use disorder, admitted for infective endocarditis and septic shock requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral lung septic emboli. She had a high opioid debt, necessitating higher than typical doses of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine infusions to maintain sedation, with clinical signs of inadequate treatment of her pain and opioid withdrawal. She was successfully started on buprenorphine/naloxone using a rapid micro-induction technique that did not cause precipitated withdrawal or require cessation of other opioids.

### Suboxone [^11777KME]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Subutex or Suboxone is administered sublingually as a single daily dose in the range of 12 to 16 mg/day. When taken sublingually, Suboxone and Subutex have similar clinical effects and are interchangeable. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies using Suboxone as initial medication. Subutex contains no naloxone and is preferred for use during induction. Following induction, Suboxone, due to the presence of naloxone, is preferred when clinical use includes unsupervised administration. The use of Subutex for unsupervised administration should be limited to those patients who cannot tolerate Suboxone, for example, those patients who have been shown to be hypersensitive to naloxone.

- **Method of administration**: Suboxone and Subutex tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved. For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably) place two tablets at a time under the tongue. Either way, the patients should continue to hold the tablets under the tongue until they dissolve, as swallowing the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product.

- **Induction**: Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

### Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone compared with injection naltrexone for opioid use disorder: Potential utility of patient characteristics in guiding choice of treatment [^116Dnyjw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release injection naltrexone are effective treatments, with distinct mechanisms, for opioid use disorder. The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other.

- **Methods**: In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N = 287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N = 283), comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing.

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.68).

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^1162VFL9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

More than 100,000 overdose deaths were reported in 2021, largely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF). Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and, like methadone, reduces morbidity and mortality while increasing retention in care. Unfortunately, initiating BUP-NX has become more complicated as IMF has largely replaced heroin in the U.S. drug supply.

Buprenorphine, an opioid partial agonist, has high affinity and low intrinsic activation at the μ-opioid receptor. Because of these properties, buprenorphine can cause precipitated withdrawal if taken too soon or at a wrong dose after full agonist opioid use. Unfortunately, this precipitation risk increases with regular fentanyl use — likely because of fentanyl's lipophilicity, which leads to a large volume of distribution and slow dissipation when used chronically. Patients have significant concerns about the severity of withdrawal needed to start buprenorphine as well as the risk of precipitated withdrawal; the possibility of a negative experience understandably fosters hesitance to begin treatment.

- **Newer methods for BUP-NX initiation**: These methods are generally categorized as very low- (or "microdosing"), low-, standard-, and high-dose (or "macrodose") protocols — each with potential benefits and risks (Table 1). Less common methods use transdermal, buccal, sublingual, and intravenous buprenorphine formulations not readily available for this outpatient purpose. Additional effective, expedited approaches would empower patients, providing more choices regarding when to initiate treatment.

### Subsys [^113eCzQm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Subsys. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

- **How to treat with naloxone**: In the event of an opioid overdose, to tell family and friends about their naloxone, and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency.
- **Educational material**: To read the patient information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116wamYW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient's clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of their home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.

Patients should ideally be seen at reasonable intervals, such as at least weekly during the first month of treatment, based on individual circumstances. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.

Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g. urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider's evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives, such as:

- **Absence of medication toxicity**: Evaluation of whether the patient experiences any harmful effects from the medication.
- **Absence of medical or behavioral adverse effects**: Monitoring of any negative effects pertaining to the patient's health or behavior.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone for heroin dependence [^117HUv9V]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2000). Low credibility.

The pharmacology of buprenorphine is unique because of its partial agonist profile at the mu-opioid receptor (i.e. high affinity, low intrinsic activity, and slow dissociation). This distinctive profile results in greater safety, less physical dependence, and greater flexibility in dose scheduling. Buprenorphine has been investigated in combination with the opioid antagonist, naloxone, with the goal of decreasing abuse, misuse, and diversion. When combined with naloxone in a sublingual tablet, buprenorphine has been shown to be effective:

- **In retaining patients in treatment**: It helps maintain patient engagement in therapeutic programs.
- **In reducing opioid use and craving**: It significantly diminishes opioid consumption and the associated urge.
- **When dosed less-than-daily**: It allows for more flexible dosing schedules.

The pharmacologic effects of buprenorphine are not altered by the addition of naloxone when administered in an appropriate combination ratio. However, if taken intravenously by individuals dependent on short- or long-acting opioids, a precipitated withdrawal syndrome is observed, which should reduce its abuse potential. This review discusses the rationale for development and evidence supporting the use of a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product. The buprenorphine/naloxone combination product should be considered for use in primary care office-based settings as a safe and effective treatment, likely to increase the availability of agonist treatment for opioid dependence.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^117SMBnD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use in patients with impaired hepatic function**: Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for those with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than those with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine's efficacy throughout the treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as significant as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Patients should be carefully monitored, and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine's efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^1148Z1g2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Discontinuing treatment**: The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film following a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Switching between buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film**: Patients being switched between buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine-only sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be started on the same dosage of the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between buprenorphine products. Not all strengths and combinations of the buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films are bioequivalent to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets as observed in pharmacokinetic studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different when patients are switched from tablets to film or vice versa. Patients should be monitored for symptoms related to overdosing or underdosing.

- **Switching between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film strengths**: As indicated in Table 1, the sizes and the compositions of the four units of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual films, i.e. 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1…

### Clinical case conference: Strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^113PbhPt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) involves medications such as methadone (a full opioid agonist) or buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist), in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. Both treatments are effective, but factors like safety, efficacy, and patient preference can lead to a decision to switch from one treatment to the other. While transferring from buprenorphine to methadone is not clinically challenging, the transition from methadone to buprenorphine is more complex. Published reports describe varied approaches to manage this transfer, aiming to minimize patient symptoms associated with methadone withdrawal and to reduce the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms when introducing the partial agonist buprenorphine.

There is no single approach for methadone to buprenorphine transfer that is superior to others, nor is there a method suitable for all case presentations. This case conference describes three different approaches to achieve a successful methadone to buprenorphine transfer and provides commentary on how the case may be managed based on published transfer strategies.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115ahuC3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

- **Switching from buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, or methadone**: There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride; however, a review of postmarketing case reports has indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy [see WARNINGS]. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

- **Treatment of alcoholism**: A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^1162LwJu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal — an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

### Diagnosis and treatment of presumed naltrexone-XR-precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient chronically treated with buprenorphine-XR: A case report [^111HRQdt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone are Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder in the United States. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, can precipitate opioid withdrawal if administered too quickly after the use of full or partial opioid agonists for those with either dependence or use disorder.

We describe a case of severe precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome after reported buprenorphine extended-release (XR) administration, despite the patient having been stable on buprenorphine-XR for several years with no missed doses or recent opioid use. Naltrexone levels were sent and helped to diagnose suspected inadvertent naltrexone-XR administration in this patient, which was likely the etiology of his precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome.

We suggest the use of high-dose buprenorphine, as well as adjunctive medications including benzodiazepines, as a treatment strategy for naltrexone-XR precipitated withdrawal in the setting of chronic buprenorphine-XR treatment.

### SPL drug information for buprenorphine hydrochloride / naloxone hydrochloride [^1151KEoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Use of buprenorphine/naloxone SL (also known as Suboxone, Zubsolv) in pregnant patients for all trimesters is advised only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitoring for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is recommended. Chronic use of opioids may lead to reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential, and it is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible. Women should be advised of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and appropriate treatment should be available. Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring will be necessary for several days after birth.

This drug is not recommended for chronic pain management during pregnancy, and adequate contraception should be discussed. Untreated opioid addiction in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes. Many experts believe that the benefits of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder during pregnancy outweigh the risks of untreated opioid use disorder. Dose adjustments of buprenorphine may be required during pregnancy, and withdrawal signs and symptoms should be monitored closely. Long-acting products are not recommended during pregnancy because the dose cannot be adjusted.

Buprenorphine/naloxone SL is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. Owing to its pharmacological effects, this drug has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations.

### Transition from oxycodone to buprenorphine/naloxone in a hospitalized patient with sickle cell disease: A case report [^113jUcfk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is increasingly used to treat pain in patients with sickle cell disease, but the optimal timing and approach for transitioning patients from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine is unknown. We present the case of a 22-year-old woman with sickle cell disease and acute on chronic pain who transitioned from high-dose oxycodone to buprenorphine/naloxone during a hospital stay for a vaso-occlusive episode. Utilizing a microdosing approach to minimize pain and withdrawal, buprenorphine/naloxone was gradually uptitrated while she received full agonist opioids. During the transition, she experienced some withdrawal in the setting of swallowed buprenorphine/naloxone tablets, which were intended to be dosed sublingually. Nevertheless, the transition was tolerable to the patient, and her pain and function significantly improved with buprenorphine treatment. This case also highlights the challenges and unique considerations that arise when providing care for a hospitalized patient who is also incarcerated.

### Abuse liability of intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine alone in buprenorphine-maintained intravenous heroin abusers [^114CnbVp]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Sublingual buprenorphine is an effective maintenance treatment for opioid dependence, yet intravenous buprenorphine misuse occurs. A buprenorphine/naloxone formulation was developed to mitigate this misuse risk. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was conducted to assess the intravenous abuse potential of buprenorphine/naloxone compared with buprenorphine in buprenorphine-maintained injection drug users (IDUs).

- **Methods**: Intravenous heroin users (n = 12) resided in the hospital for 8–9 weeks and were maintained on each of three different sublingual buprenorphine doses (2 mg, 8 mg, 24 mg). Under each maintenance dose, participants completed laboratory sessions during which the reinforcing and subjective effects of intravenous placebo, naloxone, heroin, and low and high doses of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone were examined. Every participant received each test dose under the three buprenorphine maintenance dose conditions.

- **Results**: Intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone was self-administered less frequently than buprenorphine or heroin (P < 0.0005). Participants were most likely to self-administer drugs intravenously when maintained on the lowest sublingual buprenorphine dose. Subjective ratings of 'drug liking' and 'desire to take the drug again' were lower for buprenorphine/naloxone than for buprenorphine or heroin (P = 0.0001). Participants reported that they would pay significantly less money for buprenorphine/naloxone than for buprenorphine or heroin (P < 0.05). Seven adverse events were reported; most were mild and transient.

- **Conclusions**: The study provides insights into the potential reduced abuse liability of buprenorphine/naloxone compared to buprenorphine alone in buprenorphine-maintained intravenous heroin abusers.

The buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is administered sublingually or buccally as a single daily dose. Medication should be prescribed with consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.

- **Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose**: Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and its affinity for the mu-opioid receptor [see Overdosage (10)].

	- Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements.

Where buprenorphine is used for maintenance in patients who cannot tolerate naloxone, the dosage of buprenorphine should be progressively adjusted in increments or decrements of 2 mg or 4 mg to maintain the patient in treatment and suppress opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms. After treatment induction and stabilization, the maintenance dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets is generally in the range of 4 mg to 24 mg per day, depending on the individual patient. The recommended target dosage of buprenorphine sublingual tablets is 16 mg as a single daily dose. Dosages higher than 24 mg have not demonstrated any clinical advantage. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient's level of stability, the security of their home situation, and other factors likely to affect their ability to manage supplies of take-home medication. There is no maximum recommended duration of maintenance treatment. Patients may require treatment indefinitely and should continue for as long as the use of buprenorphine sublingual tablets contributes to the intended treatment goals.

- **Method of administration**: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved.

### Office-based treatment of opiate addiction with a sublingual-tablet formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone [^111jgACF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Office-based treatment of opiate addiction with a sublingual-tablet formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone has been proposed, but its efficacy and safety have not been well studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 326 opiate-addicted persons who were assigned to office-based treatment. Sublingual tablets consisting of buprenorphine (16 mg) in combination with naloxone (4 mg), buprenorphine alone (16 mg), or placebo were given daily for four weeks. The primary outcome measures were the percentage of urine samples negative for opiates and the subjects' self-reported craving for opiates. Safety data were obtained on 461 opiate-addicted persons who participated in an open-label study of buprenorphine and naloxone (at daily doses of up to 24 mg and 6 mg, respectively) and another 11 persons who received this combination only during the trial.

- **Results**: The double-blind trial was terminated early because buprenorphine and naloxone in combination and buprenorphine alone were found to have greater efficacy than placebo. The proportion of urine samples that were negative for opiates was greater in the combined-treatment and buprenorphine groups (17.8 percent and 20.7 percent, respectively) than in the placebo group (5.8 percent, P < 0.001 for both comparisons); the active-treatment groups also reported less opiate craving (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Rates of adverse events were similar in the active-treatment and placebo groups. During the open-label phase, the percentage of urine samples negative for opiates continued to be recorded.

### Clinical case conference: Strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^117Gt3sx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Case progression**: Several approaches have been described for the management of transfer from methadone to buprenorphine, which were discussed with the patient. The following sections provide alternative scenarios for the progression of this case, based on different treatment approaches. For two methods being discussed, tapering and higher-dose transfers, there is a requirement for the patient to present in a state of withdrawal. As part of the pre-transition discussions for these methods, the importance of presenting in moderate withdrawal is key to a successful transfer, as well as the awareness of the possibility of slight worsening of withdrawal symptoms as the patient's buprenorphine is rapidly titrated.

- **Taper and inpatient transfer**: This approach is in line with the NSW Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, which have been drawn from the Australian National Guidelines for Medically Assisted Treatment of Opioid Dependence. In Australia, the opioid agonist treatment for OUD is run through a permit system, which is regulated by the State Health Departments, and it is illegal to prescribe these medications in an outpatient setting without an authority. Given the dose of methadone that this patient is prescribed, the most suitable setting in which to conduct the transfer would be an inpatient setting. As discussed, preparation of the patient is key to a successful transference, especially with regard to the risk of precipitated withdrawal and the need for the patient to be in moderate withdrawal before commencing sublingual buprenorphine.

### Suboxone [^115SUwwf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine in intravenous (2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for the treatment of opioid dependence. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature across time. Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3-hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.

The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.

Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the SUBOXONE formulation, had no clinically significant effects.

### Suboxone [^111YWpTx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

The safety of Suboxone has been evaluated in 497 opioid-dependent subjects. The prospective evaluation of Suboxone was supported by clinical trials using Subutex (buprenorphine tablets without naloxone) and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data are available from 3,214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of opioid addiction.

Few differences in adverse event profiles were noted between Suboxone and Subutex or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution. In a comparative study, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg Suboxone or 16 mg Subutex.

- **Adverse events**: The following adverse events were reported to occur in at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study:
	- The adverse event profile of buprenorphine was also characterized in the dose-controlled study of buprenorphine solution, over a range of doses in four months of treatment. Table 4 shows adverse events reported by at least 5% of subjects in any dose group in the dose-controlled study.

### Suboxone [^11328s1h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). High credibility.

Suboxone sublingual tablets contain buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl dihydrate at a 4:1 ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone (ratio of free bases). Subutex sublingual tablets contain buprenorphine HCl. Buprenorphine serves as a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor, while naloxone acts as an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Buprenorphine is classified as a Schedule III narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act.

Buprenorphine hydrochloride is a white, weakly acidic powder with limited solubility in water (17 mg/mL). Chemically, buprenorphine is 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-α-methyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol, hydrochloride [5α, 7α(S)]. It has the molecular formula C29H41N04HCl and a molecular weight of 504.10.

Naloxone hydrochloride is a white to slightly off-white powder soluble in water, dilute acids, and strong alkali. Chemically, naloxone is 17-Allyl-4,5 α-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-one hydrochloride, with the molecular formula C19H21N04HCl .2H20 and a molecular weight of 399.87.

Suboxone is an uncoated hexagonal orange tablet designed for sublingual administration. It is available in two dosage strengths: 2 mg buprenorphine with 0.5 mg naloxone, and 8 mg buprenorphine with 2 mg naloxone free bases. Each tablet also contains lactose, mannitol, cornstarch, povidone K30, citric acid, sodium citrate, and FD&C Yellow No.6.

### Approach to buprenorphine use for opioid withdrawal treatment in the emergency setting [^115MxTDT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, with approximately three million individuals in the United States affected. Buprenorphine is a medication designed, researched, and effectively used to assist in OUD recovery.

This narrative review discusses an approach to initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) for opioid-abuse recovery. Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high affinity and low intrinsic activity. Its long half-life, high potency, and 'ceiling effect' for both euphoric sensation and adverse effects make it an optimal treatment alternative for patients presenting to the ED with opioid withdrawal. While most commonly provided as a sublingual film or tablet, buprenorphine can also be delivered via transbuccal, transdermal, subdermal (implant), subcutaneous, and parenteral routes. Prior to ED administration, caution is recommended to avoid the precipitation of buprenorphine-induced opioid withdrawal.

Following the evaluation of common opioid withdrawal symptoms, a step-by-step approach to buprenorphine can be utilized to reach sustained withdrawal relief. A multimodal medication-assisted treatment (MAT) plan involving pharmacologic treatment, as well as counseling and behavioral therapy, is essential to maintaining opioid remission. Patients may be safely discharged with safe-use counseling, close outpatient follow-up, and return precautions for continued management of their OUD. Establishing a buprenorphine program in the ED involves a multifactorial approach.

### Enhancing patient choice: Using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^114JJGrb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal — an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

### Transition from oxycodone to buprenorphine/naloxone in a hospitalized patient with sickle cell disease: A case report [^111ptLxm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is increasingly used to treat pain in patients with sickle cell disease, but the optimal timing and approach for transitioning patients from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine are unknown. We present the case of a 22-year-old woman with sickle cell disease and acute on chronic pain who transitioned from high-dose oxycodone to buprenorphine/naloxone during a hospital stay for a vaso-occlusive episode. Utilizing a microdosing approach to minimize pain and withdrawal, buprenorphine/naloxone was gradually uptitrated while she received full agonist opioids. During the transition, she experienced some withdrawal due to swallowed buprenorphine/naloxone tablets, which were intended to be dosed sublingually. Nevertheless, the transition was tolerable to the patient, and her pain and function significantly improved with buprenorphine treatment. This case also highlights the challenges and unique considerations that arise when providing care for the hospitalized patient who is also incarcerated.

### A review of buprenorphine diversion and misuse: The current evidence base and experiences from around the world [^116fJiEZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Outpatient opioid addiction treatment with sublingual buprenorphine pharmacotherapy has rapidly expanded in the United States and abroad. With this increase in medication availability, there have been growing concerns about its diversion, misuse, and related harms. This narrative review defines the behaviors of diversion and misuse, examines how the pharmacology of buprenorphine alone and in combination with naloxone influences its abuse liability, and describes the epidemiological data on buprenorphine diversion and intravenous misuse. It also explores the risk factors for its intravenous misuse and the unintended consequences of misuse and diversion.

Physician practices to prevent, screen for, and therapeutically respond to these behaviors — which are a form of medication nonadherence — are discussed, and gaps in knowledge are identified. Experiences from other countries with varied healthcare systems, public policies, and access to addiction treatment underscore that diversion and misuse occur worldwide in various contexts for many different reasons and are not limited to buprenorphine. Comparisons are made with other opioids with known abuse liability and medications with no known abuse.

The objective was to facilitate understanding of diversion and misuse so that all factors influencing their expression — patient and provider characteristics and public policy — can be appreciated within a framework that also recognizes the benefits of addiction treatment.

### Prescribing the buprenorphine monoproduct for adverse effects of buprenorphine-naloxone [^117W2gqx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) reduces the risk of mortality from untreated opioid use disorder by 50% or more. However, adverse effects of BNX can cause inconsistent use or discontinuation. The buprenorphine monoproduct (BUP) is effective and is sometimes tolerated better; however, practice guidelines and insurance restrictions discourage its prescription due to concerns about diversion and injection.

An idiopathic reaction of bilateral flank pain reported by three patients is used as an example to show how to assess the success of a BUP trial. Sublingual absorption of naloxone is discussed as a potential cause of adverse effects of BNX in sensitive individuals. Issues in clinical decision-making are presented to help prescribers assess the risk-benefit ratio of a BUP trial for the individual patient, the prescriber, and society. This commentary may serve as a stimulus for changes in practice guidelines and insurance coverage policies to allow greater flexibility in the prescribing of BUP.

### Micro-dosing intravenous buprenorphine to rapidly transition from full opioid agonists [^116gjy7V]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

For patients with opioid use disorder transitioning from methadone or requiring opioid analgesia, initiating buprenorphine for opioid use disorder can be difficult because of the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Low-dose initiation, also known as micro-dosing, is an alternative to standard initiation. Prior studies relied on nonstandard dosing of tablets or films, patches, or buccal formulations, all of which are unavailable in many hospitals. We report a novel approach to micro-dosing using intravenous buprenorphine. Two patients, one on methadone maintenance and another requiring postoperative opioid analgesia, were transitioned to buprenorphine with concurrent full-agonist opioids and without precipitated withdrawal.

### The more things change: Buprenorphine/naloxone diversion continues while treatment remains inaccessible [^113XDzu4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine/naloxone, an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, is sometimes diverted for non-medical use. In Rhode Island, the prevalence of opioid use and, more recently, fentanyl in the illicit drug supply is driving overdose fatalities. This increases the need for treatment and raises questions about the changing role of diverted medication in shaping overdose risk.

- **Methods**: This study considered data from two Rhode Island-based studies conducted in 2009 and 2016. It focused on people who use illicit or diverted prescription opioids and their patterns of buprenorphine/naloxone diversion. Using targeted sampling, individuals who use opioids completed a brief questionnaire about their drug use. For the 2016 study, logistic regression was used to identify associations with recent and lifetime use of diverted medication.

- **Results**: A total of 128 individuals who use opioids non-medically participated in the 2016 study. Of these, 38% (n = 13) reported diverted buprenorphine/naloxone use in the past two months, similar to the pattern observed in 2009 (41%, n = 41). Common motivations for using diverted medication included the management of withdrawal symptoms (40%, n = 35) and self-treatment of opioid use disorder (39%, n = 34). Few reported using to "get high" (12%, n = 4). Seeking buprenorphine/naloxone treatment in the previous 12 months was positively associated with using diverted medication in the past two months (odds ratio = 5.14, 95% confidence interval = 1.0–26.5, P = 0.05). Participants in both studies reported the same barriers to care in 2009 and 2016.
