## Question

Using clonidine to help with opiate withdrawal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using clonidine for opiate withdrawal, including its mechanism, efficacy, dosing, safety, comparisons with other agents, and guideline-based recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of opioid withdrawal and how clonidine fits mechanistically. Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled versus off-label indications. Next, I will review the evidence base for efficacy and comparative effectiveness. After that, I need to check dosing regimens and practical administration details. I will then examine safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and outline a practical, patient-centered approach with contingencies for special populations and settings.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and mechanism alignment. Opioid withdrawal is driven by noradrenergic hyperactivity from locus coeruleus disinhibition when opioid tone is removed, producing autonomic and hyperarousal symptoms; clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces presynaptic norepinephrine release and thereby mitigates autonomic features of withdrawal, which is the rationale for its off-label use in opioid withdrawal syndromes [^115L3N9n] [^112MZEp1].

> I need to verify the regulatory status before proceeding. Clonidine is not FDA-approved for opioid withdrawal; its labeled indications are hypertension and ADHD, with opioid withdrawal management listed as an off-label use in FDA materials, whereas lofexidine received FDA approval in 2018 specifically for mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, which is an important distinction for documentation and formulary discussions [^115vmrHk] [^115EYd2y].

> Next, I should review the efficacy evidence and make sure I'm not overstating it. Multiple Cochrane reviews and randomized trials show that alpha-2 agonists, including clonidine, are superior to placebo for reducing severe withdrawal and improving treatment completion, but they are generally less effective than buprenorphine and roughly comparable to methadone tapers for overall withdrawal severity, with faster onset and resolution of symptoms but more adverse effects than methadone; buprenorphine consistently shows better retention and completion than clonidine or lofexidine, with a number needed to treat around 4 for completion versus alpha-2 agonists [^114vX3iC] [^1138Czbm] [^114wpoAW] [^112Hj3sv] [^115WaFy2].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing ranges and practical administration because this is where errors often occur. ASAM guidance supports oral clonidine 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, typically not exceeding 1.2 mg/day, with transdermal options used adjunctively but with delayed onset that may require oral supplementation early; some FDA documents cite a 1.0 mg/day maximum, so I should reconcile this by noting that 1.2 mg/day is the commonly used upper limit in practice and 1.0 mg/day is a conservative ceiling in certain references, and I should tailor to blood pressure response and symptom control while monitoring closely [^111mX8je] [^116Cb1Fv] [^112Cp9fK] [^1143rYh2].

> Wait, let me verify safety and monitoring because hypotension is the key limitation. Clonidine commonly causes hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, and sedation, and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate rebound hypertension; it is contraindicated in severe cardiovascular disease, and patients should be counseled on orthostatic precautions, hydration, and a planned taper; lofexidine has a more favorable hemodynamic profile with less hypotension at comparable efficacy, making it preferable in outpatient settings where monitoring is limited [^116qPep6] [^112YKvFY] [^116Cb1Fv] [^114RU1xd].

> I should confirm comparative positioning and guideline hierarchy. Major guidelines consistently recommend buprenorphine or methadone as first-line for opioid withdrawal management due to superior symptom control and retention, with alpha-2 agonists reserved as second-line when agonists are contraindicated, declined, or unavailable; lofexidine is generally preferred over clonidine when an alpha-2 agonist is used because of the lower risk of hypotension and sedation, though clonidine remains a reasonable alternative, particularly when cost or access is a barrier [^116Cb1Fv] [^114th8zu] [^111LAyq8] [^113UML6u].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't miss important nuances. In neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, clonidine is an effective non-opioid option but often requires adjunct therapy and has a slower onset than morphine, prompting pharmacokinetic modeling efforts to optimize dosing. In correctional settings, alpha-2 agonists are second-line and should not replace adequate doses of buprenorphine or methadone. In the emergency department, buprenorphine is preferred when feasible, with clonidine or lofexidine as non-opioid alternatives when agonists cannot be initiated [^116KtreR] [^112Eo6DC] [^114ywUfz] [^113BfA66] [^115pYf2b] [^115RdJf1].

> I will now examine practical implementation and common pitfalls. Clonidine is best used as part of a symptom-targeted regimen alongside medications for diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and muscle aches, with clear plans for tapering and close vital sign monitoring; I should double-check that patients understand rebound hypertension risk and have a scheduled follow-up within days of initiation or discontinuation, and I should document the off-label indication and rationale for clonidine use in the medical record [^111mX8je] [^114th8zu] [^116Cb1Fv].

> But wait, what if the patient's goal is a rapid transition to naltrexone or they decline agonists entirely. In that scenario, alpha-2 agonists can facilitate earlier initiation of extended-release naltrexone by clearing opioids more quickly than agonist tapers, though emerging data suggest that buprenorphine-based pathways with low-dose naltrexone micro-induction may also accelerate antagonist initiation. I should confirm local protocols and patient preferences before choosing among these strategies [^112XaVAG] [^111RZEbq].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Clonidine is a mechanistically rational, evidence-supported second-line option for opioid withdrawal that reliably reduces autonomic symptoms but is less effective than buprenorphine for global withdrawal control and retention. When used, it requires careful dosing, vigilant monitoring for hypotension, and a planned taper, with lofexidine favored when available due to a better hemodynamic profile and FDA approval for this indication [^116Cb1Fv] [^114th8zu] [^114wpoAW].

---

Clonidine is a **second-line, non-opioid option** [^111LAyq8] for opioid withdrawal that reduces autonomic symptoms (sweating, tachycardia, hypertension) [^1176brrG] but not craving or insomnia. It is **less effective than buprenorphine or methadone** [^114th8zu] for withdrawal control and retention, and is best used when agonists are contraindicated or declined [^111LAyq8]. Typical dosing is 0.1–0.3 mg orally every 6–8 hours (max 1.2 mg/day) [^116Cb1Fv] with close monitoring for hypotension, bradycardia, and rebound hypertension; lofexidine is preferred when available due to a safer hemodynamic profile [^116Cb1Fv].

---

## Mechanism of action

Clonidine is an **α2-adrenergic agonist** that reduces sympathetic outflow from the locus coeruleus, mitigating noradrenergic hyperactivity during withdrawal [^115L3N9n]. This reduces autonomic symptoms but **does not address craving or insomnia**, which are mediated by opioidergic pathways.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting clonidine use

Clonidine is **superior to placebo** for autonomic symptoms and treatment completion [^114vX3iC], but is less effective than buprenorphine or methadone for withdrawal severity, retention, and completion [^114th8zu]. It is best used when agonists are contraindicated or declined [^111WCexG].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

- **Initial dose**: 0.1–0.3 mg orally every 6–8 hours (max 1.2 mg/day) [^112Cp9fK].
- **Transdermal patch**: 0.1 mg/24 hours; delayed onset, may need oral supplementation early [^111mX8je].
- **Taper**: Reduce by 0.1–0.2 mg every 1–2 days over 7–10 days to avoid rebound hypertension.

---

## Comparison with other medications

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clonidine | Moderate | - Hypotension <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Sedation | Second-line; monitor vitals |
| Lofexidine | Moderate | - Less hypotension <br/> - Less sedation | Preferred α2-agonist; FDA-approved |
| Buprenorphine | High | - Mild withdrawal <br/> - Ceiling effect | First-line; partial agonist |
| Methadone | High | - Prolonged QT <br/> - Respiratory depression | First-line; full agonist |

---

Clonidine is **less effective than buprenorphine or methadone** [^notfound] but useful when agonists are not an option [^113UML6u].

---

## Side effects and risks

- **Common**: Hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, sedation [^114vX3iC].
- **Serious**: Rebound hypertension if stopped abruptly [^113pfU2r].
- **Monitoring**: Check blood pressure and heart rate at each dose change [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line**: Buprenorphine or methadone for withdrawal management [^114th8zu].
- **Second-line**: Clonidine or lofexidine when agonists are contraindicated or declined [^111LAyq8].
- **Adjuncts**: Use with symptomatic meds (e.g. loperamide, ondansetron) for residual symptoms [^111mX8je].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Clonidine is appropriate for patients who decline agonists, have contraindications to them, or are in settings where agonists are unavailable (e.g. some jails) [^114RU1xd]. It is also used for **rapid detoxification before naltrexone initiation** [^112XaVAG].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Limitations include **incomplete symptom control** — it does not address craving or insomnia — and a **risk of hypotension**, which requires close monitoring and dose titration. Rebound hypertension can occur if the drug is stopped abruptly, necessitating a gradual taper [^113pfU2r].

---

Clonidine is a **second-line, non-opioid option** for opioid withdrawal that reduces autonomic symptoms but not craving or insomnia; it is best used when agonists are contraindicated or declined, with careful monitoring for hypotension and rebound hypertension [^111LAyq8].

Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists for opioid withdrawal — clonidine dosing and comparative considerations are detailed as follows: Clonidine is generally used at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily, and is often combined with non-narcotic symptomatic medications. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in reducing severe withdrawal and in improving rates of treatment retention and completion. Comparative data indicate lofexidine and clonidine appear similarly effective, with hypotension occurring less frequently with lofexidine; therefore, lofexidine should be the preferred choice for outpatient withdrawal management where monitoring and management of hypotension are more difficult. Other agents such as guanfacine (available in the U.S.) can also be used off-label as an alternative to clonidine.

### Moxonidine for tramadol withdrawal symptoms during detoxification [^115JLb5S]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

It is well documented in the literature that noradrenergic pathways are key in the manifestation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, which is why clonidine is used as an off-label agent in opioid detoxification regimens given its anti-sympathetic properties. Moxonidine is a selective I1-imidazoline receptor agonist, similar to clonidine but with no α2-adrenergic agonist activity and subsequently fewer side effects. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with a 15-year history of tramadol use who was admitted voluntarily for detoxification. She was started on moxonidine and had an uneventful detoxification. Two months after discharge, the patient maintained tramadol abstinence with good tolerability to moxonidine. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been previously reported in the medical literature.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114th8zu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 3: Treating opioid withdrawal — core recommendations and dosing: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, since abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome placing patients at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; patients should be advised about relapse and safety risks, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, opioid withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an opioid treatment program (OTP) or in an acute care setting (under limited circumstances); for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids, methadone doses should typically be 20–30 mg per day and the dose may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given with an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine) are safe and effective for management of opioid withdrawal; however, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing symptoms, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1122WK6a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — included medications and pharmacology states that the guideline covers methadone (part 4), buprenorphine (part 5), naltrexone (part 6), naloxone (part 13), clonidine (part 3), and lofexidine (part 3). Methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, and naloxone act directly upon opioid receptors, particularly the mu subtype; methadone is a mu-receptor agonist; buprenorphine is a partial mu-receptor agonist; and naltrexone is an antagonist, with buprenorphine and naltrexone also kappa opioid receptor antagonists. Naloxone is a fast-acting antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose. Clonidine and lofexidine for the management of opioid withdrawal are described in Part 3, with lofexidine approved for this indication by the FDA in May 2018, while clonidine is not FDA-approved for opioid withdrawal syndrome in the United States but has been in use, off label, in clinical settings for over 25 years.

### Clonidine may relieve opiate withdrawal symptoms… [^11724Vxe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. In cases of drug withdrawal, the cure may be little better than the disease. The use of methadone as a withdrawal agent for heroin addiction is a case in point. However, an antihypertensive drug, clonidine hydrochloride, may help to drive a wedge into this clinical paradox. According to Mark S. Gold, MD, director of research, Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, NJ, and vice president, basic research, Psychiatric Institute of America, clonidine is the first nonopiate treatment for drug withdrawal. In both animal and double-blind crossover human studies, he says, clonidine provided "dramatic relief of subjective distress due to withdrawal". Eleven patients, addicted to opiates for six to ten years and to methadone for six to 60 months, received 5 μg/kg of clonidine or placebo orally in two doses two hours apart in the hospital.:

### Buprenorphine for managing opioid withdrawal [^114wpoAW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of buprenorphine versus tapered doses of methadone, alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine regimens for managing opioid withdrawal, in terms of the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration and completion of treatment, and adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 11, 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to December week 1, 2016), Embase (to 22 December 2016), PsycINFO (1806 to December week 3, 2016), and the Web of Science (to 22 December 2016) and handsearched the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions using buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine), symptomatic medications or placebo, and different buprenorphine-based regimens.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains of methodological quality. Six of these studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine and two with methadone; the other four studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. For the comparison of buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of intensity of withdrawal or adverse effects. However, information reported by the individual studies was suggestive of buprenorphine and methadone having similar capacity to ameliorate opioid withdrawal, without clinically significant adverse effects. The meta-analyses that were possible support a conclusion of no difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of average treatment duration (mean difference (MD) 1.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.11 to 10.72; N = 82; studies = 2; low quality) or treatment completion rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; N = 457; studies = 5; moderate quality). Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine was associated with a lower average withdrawal score (indicating less severe withdrawal) during the treatment episode, with an effect size that is considered to be small to moderate (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.28; N = 902; studies = 7; moderate quality). Patients receiving buprenorphine stayed in treatment for longer, with an effect size that is considered to be large (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; N = 558; studies = 5; moderate quality) and were more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.06; N = 1264; studies = 12; moderate quality). At the same time there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but dropout due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15; N = 134; studies = 3; low quality). The difference in treatment completion rates translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine or lofexidine. For studies comparing different rates of reduction of the buprenorphine dose, meta-analysis was possible only for treatment completion, with separate analyses for inpatient and outpatient settings. The results were diverse, and we assessed the quality of evidence as being very low. It remains very uncertain what effect the rate of dose taper has on treatment outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of severity of withdrawal, duration of withdrawal treatment, and the likelihood of treatment completion. Buprenorphine and methadone appear to be equally effective, but data are limited. It remains possible that the pattern of withdrawal experienced may differ and that withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It is not possible to draw any conclusions from the available evidence on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose. The divergent findings of studies included in this review suggest that there may be multiple factors affecting the response to the rate of dose taper. One such factor could be whether or not the initial treatment plan includes a transition to subsequent relapse prevention treatment with naltrexone. Indeed, the use of buprenorphine to support transition to naltrexone treatment is an aspect worthy of further research. Most participants in the studies included in this review were male. None of the studies reported outcomes on the basis of sex, preventing any exploration of differences related to this variable. Consideration of sex as a factor influencing response to withdrawal treatment would be relevant research for selecting the most appropriate type of intervention for each individual.

### An open-label randomized trial of intramuscular olanzapine versus oral clonidine for symptomatic treatment of opioid withdrawal in the emergency department [^116aw5Uh]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Patients with opioid withdrawal often present to the Emergency Department (ED), but many EDs do not have the infrastructure in place to initiate treatment with opioid agonists (methadone or buprenorphine). Therefore, ED management often entails symptomatic control. The purpose of this study was to compare olanzapine to clonidine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing 10mg of IM olanzapine to 0.3mg of oral clonidine for symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Adult (18 years and older) ED patients reporting a history of opioid use and symptoms consistent with withdrawal were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had already received treatment during the ED encounter, were pregnant, incarcerated, or unable to provide consent. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive olanzapine or clonidine for their initial treatment. A baseline Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score was calculated. After 30min, the patient could receive any additional treatment at the ED physician's discretion. The primary outcome was need for additional medication (rescue) within 1h of study medication administration. Secondary outcomes included change in COWS score and adverse reactions. Results: We enrolled 63 patients (33 olanzapine, 30 clonidine). Demographic characteristics were similar for both groups (median age 45, range 21–67, 54% male) as well as baseline COWS score (median score 11). The median time since last opiate use was 48h for both groups (range 4–116). Rescue was given within 1h for olanzapine for 9 (27%) patients and for clonidine in 19 (63%) patients (difference 36%, 95% CI 13–59%). Decrease in COWS score at 1h was 8.3 for olanzapine and 5.1 for clonidine (difference 3.2, 95% CI 0.3–6). Adverse events were uncommon: akathisia (1, olanzapine), hypotension (2, clonidine), respiratory depression (0). Conclusions: Treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms with 10mg of IM olanzapine results in a lower incidence of rescue medication administration and improved symptoms (COWS score) compared to 0.3mg of oral clonidine.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113BKnG3]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing — discontinuation, tapering, and withdrawal management: In patients with OUD, office-based opioid dependence treatment may be helpful, and the use of buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) is an important tool to consider. If needed, tapering or discontinuation of opioid therapy should occur, with tapering that may be slowly articulated with a decrease of 10% of the original dose per week, though some patients can be tapered or weaned more rapidly without any major adverse effects over a 6-to-8-week period. The symptoms of abstinence syndrome can be managed with clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg orally every 6 hours or clonidine transdermal patch 0.1 mg 24 hours weekly during the taper, and patients should be monitored for significant hypotension and anticholinergic side effects. Symptoms of mild opioid withdrawal occasionally persist for 6 months after opioids have been discontinued; physicians should be cautious and preferably not treat withdrawal symptoms with opioids or benzodiazepines once the weaning process or discontinuation of opioids is started. Supportive care and referrals are described: the patient may be referred for counseling or other psychological support during the tapering period if there are significant cognitive-emotional and/ or behavioral issues; if such issues arise, the physician should refer the patient to a chemical dependency center; and physicians not trained in pain medicine may refer their patients in need of opioid tapering to pain management specialists or if complex to addictionologists. In some patients it may be necessary to slow the tapering and weaning timeline from weekly to monthly dose adjustments, and careful and meticulous downward tapering along with close monitoring is warranted when weaning patients off high doses of opioids.

### Safety and efficacy of lofexidine for medically managed opioid withdrawal: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113LThCu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The safety profile demonstrated in this study was also congruent with earlier studies. However, rates for hypotension and bradycardia were higher in the current study, presumably because of the protocol requirement of reporting hypotension and bradycardia as AEs if values met predefined criteria, regardless of any symptomatology.

Blood pressure and heart rate reductions are anticipated with use of α 2 -adrenergic agonists because of their known class mechanism of action. Norepinephrine release is blunted by these agents, thereby counteracting the noradrenergic hyperactivity of opioid withdrawal; α 2 -adrenergic agonism also results directly in lowered blood pressure and heart rate. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate can be adequately managed and potentially minimized by withholding a dose of medication, as was the practice in this trial, or lowering the dose, as in another trial. In the review of α 2 -adrenergic agonists for OWS management, hypotension was noted to be more frequent with clonidine than lofexidine at similarly efficacious doses. However, this study does not adequately inform the comparative efficacy or safety of lofexidine versus clonidine, which would require a head-to-head trial.

The limitations of this study include some facets of its design. Opioid withdrawal is a proximal treatment goal, often necessary but always insufficient to fully manage physiologic opioid dependence. However, the role of lofexidine investigated in this study did not extend beyond its use in the early stage of withdrawal and it was not evaluated with opioid agonist therapy (OAT) or agonist-assisted withdrawal. The present study also did not include participants with iatrogenic opioid physiologic dependence in pain treatment, an important target population in which scenarios of opioid dose reduction warrant further study. Additionally, our requirement to discontinue participants based on predefined vital sign and ECG values, although necessary as safety precautions for an investigational trial, may be overly conservative for real-world practice. The study results are strengthened by the large number of participants enrolled and the use of the SOWS-Gossop, a sensitive, precise assessment that captures the participant's experience of OWS. The use of a placebo control group, as required by the FDA, raises ethical issues regarding depriving patients of known efficacious withdrawal treatments. This was partially addressed by use of ancillary medications (such as bismuth sulfate, acetaminophen, and zolpidem) and by offering rescue procedures (such as buprenorphine) to those that terminated early.

### Opioid withdrawal precipitated by long-acting antagonists [^114Lqgja]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) after opioid antagonist administration can be challenging to manage in the emergency department (ED), particularly if caused by a long-acting opioid antagonist such as naltrexone. There are no evidence-based guidelines to assist in safely and efficiently managing patients with this syndrome.

Objective Of Review

To review current practice on the treatment of long-acting antagonist POW and make recommendations on the treatment of this complex disease process.

Methods

A literature search of opioid withdrawal cases precipitated by naltrexone was done using PubMed. One of the authors screened all the results of this search by title and abstract, leading to a final count of 27 articles that were reviewed in full by all authors. English language cases that involved precipitated opioid withdrawal from a long-acting opioid antagonist were included. Data were extracted, including the precipitant involved and dose, severity of opioid withdrawal, treatments rendered, and response to treatment. In all cases where symptoms and signs were described, a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score was calculated based on the information available.

Results

Twenty-seven papers were included. Naltrexone alone was the primary antagonist reported in 19 of the papers, extended-release naltrexone in two, naltrexone-morphine combination in two, and nalmefene in four. Treatment most commonly included fluid replacement, benzodiazepines, antiemetics, and clonidine. Full opioid agonist treatment, although often suggested, was poorly described. Buprenorphine successfully reduced the severity and duration of withdrawal in several cases. No standardized response scale was used, and response to treatment ranged from 3 to 48 h prior to resolution of clinical effects.

Conclusions

Management of POW from long-acting antagonists is a complex problem with little formal evaluation of treatment options. There is not currently a sufficiently robust body of literature to support an evidence-based guideline. However, use of intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and benzodiazepines is commonly reported as successful and seems to be a reasonable approach until this process is better studied. A treatment strategy using partial agonists such as buprenorphine is emerging and may represent a safe and effective treatment pathway for these patients.

### A multi-center randomized trial of buprenorphine-naloxone versus clonidine for opioid detoxification: findings from the national institute on drug abuse clinical trials network [^117MB9b7]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

The clinical effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone (bup-nx) and clonidine for opioid detoxification in in-patient and out-patient community treatment programs was investigated in the first studies of the National Institute of Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network.

Design

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM IV)-diagnosed opioid-dependent individuals seeking short-term treatment were randomly assigned, in a 2: 1 ratio favoring bup-nx, to a 13-day detoxification using bup-nx or clonidine.

Methods

A total of 113 in-patients (77 bup-nx, 36 clonidine) and 231 out-patients (157 bup-nx, 74 clonidine) participated. Supportive interventions included appropriate ancillary medications and standard counseling procedures guided by a self-help handbook. The criterion for treatment success was defined as the proportion of participants in each condition who were both retained in the study for the entire duration and provided an opioid-free urine sample on the last day of clinic attendance. Secondary outcome measures included use of ancillary medications, number of side effects reported and withdrawal and craving ratings.

Findings

A total of 59 of the 77 (77%) in-patients assigned to the bup-nx condition achieved the treatment success criterion compared to eight of the 36 (22%) assigned to clonidine, whereas 46 of the 157 (29%) out-patients assigned to the bup-nx condition achieved the treatment success criterion, compared to four of the 74 (5%) assigned to clonidine.

Conclusion

The benefits of bup-nx for opioid detoxification are supported and illustrate important ways in which clinical research can be conducted in community treatment programs.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^116y1Lrk]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Evidentiary table — systematic review of randomized controlled trials of buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal in inpatient and outpatient settings, with no studies in emergency departments, compared buprenorphine with methadone, clonidine, and lofexidine and assessed intensity of withdrawal, adverse effects, and treatment completion. Across 27 studies with 3,048 participants, meta-analysis was possible for treatment duration (similar for buprenorphine and methadone) 1.3 days and treatment completion rates, risk ratio = 1.04 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.2); versus clonidine/lofexidine, buprenorphine reduced withdrawal scores, −0.43 (95% CI −0.58 to −0.28), increased completion, risk ratio = 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1), and showed no significant difference in adverse events, yielding number needed to treat = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), where for every 4 treated with buprenorphine, 1 additional person will complete treatment compared with clonidine or lofexidine. The table states buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal and that buprenorphine and methadone appear to be equally effective but data are limited; limitations include no ED studies, most participants being men with no outcomes based on sex, 7 studies with pharmaceutical company funding and funding source unclear for 7 studies, 12 studies at high risk of bias, and no meta-analysis could be done for the comparison with methadone for the outcome of withdrawal or adverse effects.

### Alpha2-receptor agonists for treatment and prevention of iatrogenic opioid abstinence syndrome in critically ill patients [^115VXkxx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the use of alpha(2)-agonists in the treatment and prevention of iatrogenic opioid abstinence syndrome (IOAS) in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

Primary literature was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1950-June 2009), EMBASE (1988-June 2009), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009), and the Cochrane Library (1996-June 2009), using the names of individual alpha(2)-agonists and the following key words: children, opioid withdrawal, opioid, and adult. Relevant abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, reference citations from selected articles, and manufacturers' product information were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. Three retrospective studies and 6 case reports/series representing 44 patients were included for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Central alpha(2)-agonists are thought to minimize symptoms of IOAS by decreasing presynaptic outflow of catecholamines. Successful use of clonidine and dexmedetomidine for management of IOAS has been reported. Lofexidine, an alpha(2)-agonist not yet approved in the US, may offer similar withdrawal symptom relief but has yet to be studied in the intensive care setting. Although the quality of studies identified was limited, preliminary evidence does provide some support for the use of transdermal clonidine and injectable dexmedetomidine in the treatment and prevention of IOAS. These agents were shown to facilitate discontinuation of opioids and to minimize withdrawal symptoms with few reported adverse events.

Conclusions

Central alpha(2)-agonists appear to be effective and safe second-line agents for treatment and prevention of IOAS. Further studies should be conducted to determine their role in the therapy of patients with IOAS.

### Pharmacokinetic modeling and model-based hypothesis generation for dose optimization of clonidine in neonates with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^114ywUfz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The model‐generated clonidine dosing regimens provide a data‐driven approach to prospectively evaluate additional clonidine dosages with the potential to decrease the length of stay/treatment and reduce the need for adjunct therapy with clonidine treatment in NOWS.

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, or NOWS, describes the subset of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurring in neonates with in‐utero exposure to opioids. From 2000 to 2016, there was a significant increase in the incidence of NOWS from 1.2 to 8.8 per 1,000 hospital births. Neonates with NOWS demonstrate symptoms from tremors, irritability, and poor feeding to fever, increased muscle tone, and seizures, and they are more likely to have low birth weight and respiratory complications.

Pharmacological intervention is indicated in neonates with moderate‐to‐severe withdrawal symptoms and those who fail to respond to nonpharmacological therapy. Pharmacological treatments used for NOWS include opioids and non‐opioids (e.g. clonidine and phenobarbital). While the commonly used opioids have favorable safety profiles in inpatient settings, preclinical evidence suggests perinatal opioid exposure could have short‐term and long‐term neurobehavioral consequences. In contrast, α 2 ‐adrenergic receptor agonists, including clonidine, have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischemic cerebral injury in preclinical studies. Clonidine is thought to inhibit noradrenergic neurotransmission by stimulation of α 2 ‐adrenergic receptors, therefore alleviating withdrawal symptoms. Adjunctive clonidine therapy has been evaluated in NOWS, and its use as primary therapy was initially reported in case series, followed by a pilot study that reported shorter treatment duration with clonidine than morphine treatment. Clonidine is well tolerated in neonates with NOWS. The reported starting dosages are usually from 0.5–1 μg/kg every 3–6 hours up to 1.5 μg/kg every 3 hours (12 μg/kg/day). The dose escalation and weaning schedules vary among studies and institutional protocols, and the maximum reported dosage is 3 μg/kg every 3 hours (24 μg/kg/day).

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^114RU1xd]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines for Managing Substance Withdrawal in Jails — alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (second-line treatment) for opioid withdrawal: Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label use of clonidine) can be used to treat withdrawal when patients choose to taper off buprenorphine or methadone, and in preparation for initiation of extended-release naltrexone. These medications are a second-line option, because they do not relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms as effectively as buprenorphine and methadone and can cause low blood pressure, the risk of which is increased when patients are not adequately hydrated, and there can be dangerous elevations in blood pressure when this medication is stopped in patients with existing hypertension. When used, these medications are often combined with other medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms, such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, various medications for insomnia, and ondansetron for nausea. Lofexidine or clonidine may also be appropriate to manage opioid withdrawal in the rare situations where complete opioid withdrawal management is clinically indicated, including when the patient declines treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.

### Opioid antagonists with minimal sedation for opioid withdrawal [^116YvCuT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of opioid antagonists plus minimal sedation for opioid withdrawal. Comparators were placebo as well as more established approaches to detoxification, such as tapered doses of methadone, adrenergic agonists, buprenorphine and symptomatic medications.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to December 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. We also searched two trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials along with prospective controlled cohort studies comparing opioid antagonists plus minimal sedation versus other approaches or different opioid antagonist regimens for withdrawal in opioid-dependent participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Ten studies (6 randomised controlled trials and 4 prospective cohort studies, involving 955 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. We considered 7 of the 10 studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the domains we assessed. Nine studies compared an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus a treatment regimen based primarily on an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine). Other comparisons (placebo, tapered doses of methadone, buprenorphine) made by included studies were too diverse for any meaningful analysis. This review therefore focuses on the nine studies comparing an opioid antagonist (naltrexone or naloxone) plus clonidine or lofexidine versus treatment primarily based on clonidine or lofexidine. Five studies took place in an inpatient setting, two studies were in outpatients with day care, two used day care only for the first day of opioid antagonist administration, and one study described the setting as outpatient without indicating the level of care provided. The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of opioid antagonist treatment regimen, the comparator, the outcome measures assessed, and the means of assessing outcomes. As a result, the validity of any estimates of overall effect is doubtful, therefore we did not calculate pooled results for any of the analyses. The quality of the evidence for treatment with an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist is very low. Two studies reported data on peak withdrawal severity, and four studies reported data on the average severity over the period of withdrawal. Peak withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists in combination with an adrenergic agonist appears to be more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, but the average severity over the withdrawal period is less. In some situations antagonist-induced withdrawal may be associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion compared to withdrawal managed with adrenergic agonists. However, this result was not consistent across studies, and the extent of any benefit is highly uncertain. We could not extract any data on the occurrence of adverse events, but two studies reported delirium or confusion following the first dose of naltrexone. Delirium may be more likely with higher initial doses and with naltrexone rather than naloxone (which has a shorter half-life), but we could not confirm this from the available evidence. Insufficient data were available to make any conclusions on the best duration of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Using opioid antagonists plus alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists is a feasible approach for managing opioid withdrawal. However, it is unclear whether this approach reduces the duration of withdrawal or facilitates transfer to naltrexone treatment to a greater extent than withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist. A high level of monitoring and support is desirable for several hours following administration of opioid antagonists because of the possibility of vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium. Using opioid antagonists to induce and accelerate opioid withdrawal is not currently an active area of research or clinical practice, and the research community should give greater priority to investigating approaches, such as those based on buprenorphine, that facilitate the transition to sustained-release preparations of naltrexone.

### Clonidine in outpatient detoxification from methadone maintenance… [^1172MXJZ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Inpatient narcotic detoxification with clonidine hydrochloride has been used since 1978. Outpatient withdrawal, potentially more useful, has not been adequately studied. This report describes a double-blind random assignment of 49 methadone hydrochloride — maintained patients whose dose had been lowered to 20 mg. Twenty-five were detoxified using methadone at 1-mg decrements, 24 by abrupt substitution with clonidine. Approximately 40% of both groups achieved successful detoxification, with one third maintaining abstinence over the subsequent six months. The groups were also largely equivalent on withdrawal symptoms, but the clonidine group experienced symptoms in the first half of the study and the methadone group in the second half. Clonidine appears to be a safe and efficacious outpatient treatment for opiate withdrawal, although the results were less favorable than those obtained in open or inpatient studies.

### A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine in the management of short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal [^115WaFy2]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal.

Design

Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4-week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat.

Setting

Two specialist, out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.

Participants

One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes.

Interventions

Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8-day withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling).

Measurements

Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal.

Secondary Outcomes

Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period.

Findings

The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3–8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4–18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 ± 2.5 versus 4.5 ± 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1–2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 ± 8.2 versus 14.6 ± 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8–9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported.

Conclusions

Buprenorphine is effective for short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications.

### Clonidine as monotherapy for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a randomized trial [^112Eo6DC]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Need for Adjunct Medication

More clonidine-treated infants required adjunct therapy than the morphine-treated infants, as follows: 27/60 (45%) and 6/60 (10%), respectively (P < .001). The results were similar when excluding the withdrawn subjects (P < .001). The adjusted odds for adjunct therapy were higher for clonidine (odds ratio = 8.85, 95% CI: [2.87–27.31], P < .001; Table 3). No other factor except heavier birth weight was associated with adjunct therapy (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI [1.04–1.31]).

### The successful treatment of opioid withdrawal-induced refractory muscle spasms with 5-HTP in a patient intolerant to clonidine [^115SnTYp]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Instituting drug holidays for chronic opioid using patients is becoming commonplace for pain practitioners initiating procedures such as intrathecal pump or spinal cord stimulator trials. As such, pain practitioners need to be adept in their management of acute opioid withdrawal. Successfully weaning an opioid dependent patient off of chronic opioids requires a thorough knowledge of the available adjuvants to assist in this process. However, that selection can become exhausted by adjuvant side effects or by ineffective attenuation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. In that case, novel drugs, or novel application of currently available medications must be sought after to assist in the drug holiday. We present a case in which refractory muscle spasms secondary to opioid withdrawal were successfully treated with an over-the-counter supplement that is not typically used for the attenuation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. In a patient intolerant to the side effects of clonidine, we were able to successfully wean chronic opiates by treating refractory muscle spasms with the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). We hypothesize that our success with this medication gives further credence to the role of serotonin in opioid withdrawal somatic symptomatology, and supports the need for future research to clarify the role of serotonin precursors or serotonin modulating drugs as potential alternatives in those unable to follow standard treatment protocols.

### Pharmacological therapies for management of opium withdrawal [^1112aWZh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic therapies for management of heroin withdrawal have been studied and reviewed widely. Opium dependence is generally associated with less severe dependence and milder withdrawal symptoms than heroin. The evidence on withdrawal management of heroin might therefore not be exactly applicable for opium.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacologic therapies for the management of the acute phase of opium withdrawal.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources up to September 2017: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, regional and national databases (IMEMR, Iranmedex, and IranPsych), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, and reference lists of all relevant papers. In addition, we contacted known investigators to obtain missing data or incomplete trials.

Selection Criteria

Controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials on pharmacological therapies, compared with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacologic treatments, different doses of the same drug, and psychosocial intervention, to manage acute withdrawal from opium in a maximum duration of 30 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 13 trials involving 1096 participants. No pooled analysis was possible. Studies were carried out in three countries, Iran, India, and Thailand, in outpatient and inpatient settings. The quality of the evidence was generally very low. When the mean of withdrawal symptoms was provided for several days, we mainly focused on day 3. The reason for this was that the highest severity of opium withdrawal is in the second to fourth day. Comparing different pharmacological treatments with each other, clonidine was twice as good as methadone for completion of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.38; 361 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence). All the other results showed no differences between the considered drugs: baclofen versus clonidine (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.80; 66 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence); clonidine versus clonidine plus amantadine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.24; 69 participants, 1 study); clonidine versus buprenorphine in an inpatient setting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20; 1 study, 35 participants, very low-quality evidence); methadone versus tramadol (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.37; 1 study, 72 participants, very low-quality evidence); methadone versus methadone plus gabapentin (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.43; 1 study, 40 participants, low-quality evidence), and tincture of opium versus methadone (1 study, 74 participants, low-quality evidence). Comparing different pharmacological treatments with each other, adding amantadine to clonidine decreased withdrawal scores rated at day 3 (mean difference (MD) -3.56, 95% CI -5.97 to -1.15; 1 study, 60 participants, very low-quality evidence). Comparing clonidine with buprenorphine in an inpatient setting, we found no difference in withdrawal symptoms rated by a physician (MD -1.40, 95% CI -2.93 to 0.13; 1 study, 34 participants, very low-quality evidence), and results in favour of buprenorpine when rated by participants (MD -11.80, 95% CI -15.56 to -8.04). Buprenorphine was superior to clonidine in controlling severe withdrawal symptoms in an outpatient setting (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1 study, 76 participants). We found no difference in the comparison of methadone versus tramadol (MD 0.04, 95% CI -2.68 to 2.76; 1 study, 72 participants) and in the comparison of methadone versus methadone plus gabapentin (MD -2.20, 95% CI -6.72 to 2.32; 1 study, 40 participants). Comparing clonidine versus buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, more adverse effects were reported in the clonidine group (1 study, 76 participants). Higher numbers of participants in the clonidine group experienced hypotension at days 5 to 8, headache at days 1 to 8, sedation at days 5 to 8, dizziness and dry mouth at days 1 to 10, and nausea at days 1 to 9. Sweating was reported in a significantly higher number of participants in the buprenorphine group at days 1 to 10. We found no difference between groups for all the other comparisons considering this outcome. Comparing different dosages of the same pharmacological detoxification treatment, a high dose of clonidine (1 to 1.2 mg/day) did not differ from a low dose of clonidine (0.5 to 0.6 mg/day) in completion of treatment in an inpatient setting (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; 1 study, 68 participants), however a higher number of participants with hypotension was reported in the high-dose group (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.98). Gradual reduction of methadone was associated with more adverse effects than abrupt withdrawal of methadone (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.94; 1 study, 20 participants, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Results did not support using any specific pharmacological approach for the management of opium withdrawal due to generally very low-quality evidence and small or no differences between treatments. However, it seems that opium withdrawal symptoms are significant, especially at days 2 to 4 after discontinuation of opium. All of the assessed medications might be useful in alleviating symptoms. Those who receive clonidine might experience hypotension.

### The clinical use of clonidine in abrupt withdrawal from methadone… [^1118b1TG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Clonidine hydrochloride was found to be effective in the treatment of methadone hydrochloride withdrawal. Under controlled inpatient conditions established to assess dosage guidelines and to examine specific signs and symptoms of withdrawal, 20 of 25 patients were able to withdraw completely from methadone by the end of a two-week period. In most patients, ten to 11 days of clonidine administration, with a peak mean dose of 16 μg/kg/day, resulted in a perceived reduction in symptoms compared with previous attempts to become opiate free. At these doses clonidine significantly reduced standing blood pressure without producing clinical problems. The withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and muscular aching were most resistant to clonidine treatment and were reported by the majority of patients.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^117CVqv3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal (detoxification) is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term opioid replacement treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were systematically searched to October 2003. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing buprenorphine with reducing doses of methadone, alpha2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different buprenorphine-based regimes, to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was undertaken where possible, with sensitivity analyses used to assess the impact of methodological quality.

Main Results

Thirteen studies (10 RCTs), involving 744 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Seven studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine; 3 compared buprenorphine with methadone; 1 compared buprenorphine with oxazepam; 2 compared rapid and slow rates of tapering buprenorphine dose; 1 compared 3 different starting doses of buprenorphine. For groups treated with buprenorphine, withdrawal severity was less than that in groups treated with clonidine; peak severity was similar to those treated with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. Withdrawal is probably more severe when doses are tapered rapidly following a period of maintenance treatment. Buprenorphine is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and completion of withdrawal is significantly more likely with buprenorphine (Relative Risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.62). In the two available studies, there was no statistically significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal for buprenorphine compared to methadone in reducing doses. Completion of withdrawal following buprenorphine maintenance treatment may be more likely when doses are reduced gradually.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. There appears to be no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of completion of withdrawal, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. Many aspects of treatment protocol and relative effectiveness need to be investigated further in order to determine the most effective way of using buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113BfA66]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Adjunctive medication use during opioid withdrawal management specifies that adjunctive medications (e.g., clonidine, anti-nausea medication) should not be necessary if buprenorphine or methadone is provided in adequate doses, typically ≥ 16 mg/day of buprenorphine, and should not be used in the place of an adequate dosage of buprenorphine or methadone; patient discomfort during withdrawal management may indicate the dose of buprenorphine or methadone is too low.

### Safety and efficacy of lofexidine for medically managed opioid withdrawal: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^116qPep6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to their use as maintenance treatments for OUD, opioid agonists such as buprenorphine and methadone are used for OWS management, but have limitations including the potential for misuse and some restrictions on availability because of prejudicial stigma and special regulatory requirements. The α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine, an antihypertensive, is used off-label for OWS management, but is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, has not been adequately studied to inform consistent dosing guidelines, especially for nonspecialists, and may be limited by significant sedation and hypotension at doses effective in alleviating symptoms of OWS.

Lofexidine is an α 2 -adrenergic agonist that has shown evidence in several studies of efficacy in the management of OWS and may have a more favorable side effect profile compared with clonidine. It has been approved and used widely for OWS management in the United Kingdom since the early 1990s. At the recommendation of the FDA, in order to meet the agency's criteria for potential approval of lofexidine, this study was undertaken to further define the efficacy and safety of lofexidine for management of opioid withdrawal. The essential design of the study was recommended by the FDA to meet registration requirements. On the basis of results of this study and a previously reported pivotal trial, the FDA approved lofexidine in May 2018 with an indication for mitigation of withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt discontinuation of opioids in adults.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^115FC99k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is common due to the current opioid addiction epidemic. Infants born to women covertly abusing prescription opioids may not be identified as at risk until withdrawal signs present. Buprenorphine is a newer treatment for maternal opioid addiction and appears to result in a milder withdrawal syndrome than methadone. Initial treatment is with nonpharmacological measures including decreasing stimuli, however pharmacological treatment is commonly required. Opioid monotherapy is preferred, with phenobarbital or clonidine uncommonly needed as adjunctive therapy. Rooming-in and breastfeeding may decease the severity of withdrawal. Limited evidence is available regarding long-term effects of perinatal opioid exposure.

Comparative and alternative approaches during withdrawal management: One study concluded that there are no significant differences in treatment completion with methadone versus buprenorphine, while one study found methadone was superior to placebo; three RCTs concluded buprenorphine may be more effective than methadone, and buprenorphine and methadone were more effective than clonidine; rapid induction onto naltrexone ER using low dose naltrexone may be an option when opioid agonist therapy is not available or desired.

### Optimal drug, optimal dose, or both in the pharmacological treatment of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome? [^116LFGi9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

One could argue that an exposure–response relationship should have been explored before engaging in a large, blinded efficacy trial. The model of Xie et al. would have allowed dose exploration through simulation that would have been able to achieve therapeutic concentrations quicker, which may have led to downstream improvement in the clinical endpoints of treatment time and length of stay. Indeed, Xie et al. identified the maturation of clearance in their paper and suggested increasing the dose by 50% at Week 2 of life. In defense of the investigators, this specific change would have not made a difference in the early days of treatment. There is also the challenge for the clinical trialist of tension between the conservatism of the clinicians who care for the infants on the ward and acceptance of novel but untested dose regimens. This is not unwarranted, given the potential cardiovascular effects of clonidine and the large interpatient variability in maturation of the clearance of clonidine. Lastly, assuming investigators had incorporated a loading dose, the operational complexity of maintaining a blind would complicate clinical trial pharmacy operations (in what was already a challenging study to run). In the end, the trial that was done provided a large number of samples paired with hard clinical outcomes. This provides greater confidence in the simulations for future guidance.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists in opioid withdrawal [^115kT1wA]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper presents the main findings of a systematic (Cochrane) review of the effectiveness of alpha2-adrenergic agonists in managing opioid withdrawal.

Design

The original systematic review included controlled trials that compared alpha2-adrenergic agonists with another form of treatment (or placebo) in participants who were primarily opioid-dependent.

Main Findings

Ten studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Withdrawal intensity is similar to, or marginally greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, but signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. The likelihood of completing withdrawal is similar, or slightly less, with clonidine or lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Three studies compared the alpha2-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and lofexidine. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Conclusions

Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes, which may provide greater opportunity for psychosocial intervention. Methadone regimes may be preferable for withdrawal in outpatient settings where the risk of relapse to heroin use is high. The use of methadone may also facilitate transfer to maintenance treatment should completion of withdrawal become unlikely. For those who are well prepared for withdrawal and seeking earlier resolution of withdrawal symptoms, alpha2-adrenergic agonist treatment may be preferred. Clonidine and lofexidine appear equally effective for inpatient settings, but the lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to use in outpatient settings.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112KkVJF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the end point of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists to manage opioid withdrawal.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966-July 2008), EMBASE (January 1985–2008 Week 31), PsycINFO (1967 to 7 August 2008) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all authors.

Main Results

Twenty-four studies, involving 1631 participants, were included. Twenty-one were randomised controlled trials. Thirteen studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal, and despite higher rates of adverse effects, are associated with significantly higher rates of completion of treatment. For the comparison of alpha2-adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to or marginally greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. No significant difference was detected in rates of completion of withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared to reducing doses of methadone, or clonidine compared to lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimes based on clonidine or lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days but methadone is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Multimodal acute pain management in the parturient with opioid use disorder: a review [^116X9LxY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Miscellaneous Adjuvants

Clonidine

Clonidine is an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist known for its sedative, antihypertensive, and vasodilatory effects. It is also used for symptomatic control of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Several studies have shown its efficacy as analgesic agents in these patients. In this patient population, use of neuraxial clonidine may be indicated.

One meta-analysis showed that administration of clonidine and morphine intrathecally extended the time to first analgesia request and decreased postoperative opioid use. Addition of clonidine to the neuraxial local anesthetic can increase analgesia. A dose of 0.5–1 mcg/kg (50–100 mcg) can be added to the local anesthetic solution to be injected spinally. In the laboring patient, 2 mcg/cc clonidine can be added to the local anesthetic and opioid mixture administered epidurally. In one study of seven women, post cesarean delivery analgesia with clonidine was effective aside from one instance of hypotension. Moreover, this approach is especially useful for opioid-abstinent women. Another study found that patients receiving intrathecal bupivacaine with clonidine had a reduced area of incisional hyperalgesia 48 hours after cesarean delivery. However, there was no difference in other factors such as pain scores and postoperative morphine use. Overall, studies regarding clonidine use have yielded mixed results, with many studies not showing differences in analgesia when administered with other analgesics such as ropivacaine. More research should be done to explore clonidine's role in patients with OUD.

Nitrous Oxide

Nitrous oxide is an inhaled analgesic that has been used for pain relief during labor and delivery for many years. Its use is safe and well tolerated, with additional advantages being its low cost and high availability. Nitrous oxide is metabolized by anaerobic bacteria in the gut and has a rapid half-life of five minutes. It may be a suitable alternative for opioid abstinent patients; however, due to risks of respiratory depression with concomitant opioid use, it is not recommended for patients with untreated OUD. One study found that pregnant patients using nitrous oxide did not prefer it to neuraxial analgesia. While the use of nitrous oxide is generally safe for the newborn, a recent case control study found that nitrous oxide administration to the mother during birth was an independent predictor of neonatal vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide potentiates the effects of opioids; thus, there is an increased risk of respiratory depression when combined with other opioids. Physicians should exercise caution when administering nitrous oxide to the parturient with OUD, as these patients may require increased monitoring.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to alpha-adrenergic agonists, DoD/VA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating clonidine or lofexidine as second-line therapy in patients with OUD with an indication for withdrawal management, if methadone and buprenorphine are contraindicated, unacceptable, or unavailable.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112XaVAG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Medications in opioid withdrawal — strategy overview describes two main strategies: the provision of gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists, typically methadone or buprenorphine, and the use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine, and off-label use of clonidine) with other non-narcotic medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms; both are superior to no treatment with respect to withdrawal severity and treatment completion. Methadone and buprenorphine are generally more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and in patients that are quite anxious about the symptoms of the abstinence syndrome, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may be preferred. Evidence cited indicates methadone tapers or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists result in similar severity of withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine may be more effective than alpha-2-adrenergic agonists in terms of withdrawal severity, duration, and treatment completion, managing withdrawal with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may enable a more rapid initiation if treatment with naltrexone is planned, and buprenorphine and methadone appear to be similarly effective although data are limited.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112Hj3sv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the end point of substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, for withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (January 1985 to 2008 Week 31), PsycINFO (1967 to 7 August 2008) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process was confirmed by consultation between all authors.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies involving 1736 participants were included. The major comparisons were with methadone (5 studies) and clonidine or lofexidine (12 studies). Five studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It appears that completion of withdrawal treatment may be more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.49, P = 0.18) but more studies are required to confirm this. Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27, P < 0.001), and are more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.06, P < 0.001). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. Buprenorphine may offer some advantages over methadone, at least in inpatient settings, in terms of quicker resolution of withdrawal symptoms and possibly slightly higher rates of completion of withdrawal.

### Safety and efficacy of lofexidine for medically managed opioid withdrawal: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115jah1D]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Data from this study suggest that lofexidine is a safe and effective treatment for patients undergoing acute withdrawal from opioids following abrupt cessation. Lofexidine could add to the armamentarium for withdrawal management and expand treatment access, especially when a nonopioid agent is desired, or when agonist-assisted withdrawal is not easily obtainable or adequate as a stand-alone option for a patient's individual treatment goal. Forthcoming results of other trials should help to further elaborate clinical utility and applicability in a wider range of clinical settings. Given its efficacy in reducing the severity of OWS, which has a consistent underlying mechanism in dependent patients regardless of the opioid used, lofexidine may also be useful for managing OWS associated with discontinuation or dose reduction of OAT or opioids prescribed for analgesia (although these were not studied in the current trial). The demonstration of improved withdrawal symptoms and increased withdrawal completion rates supports that lofexidine can play a role in helping to overcome the OWS barrier. Further research is warranted to improve overall low retention rates in patients with OUD during opioid withdrawal treatment. The formal FDA withdrawal management indication for lofexidine, with well-known α 2 -adrenergic agonist class effects, will provide patients and practitioners an important new tool to help facilitate continuing care.

### Buprenorphine vs. morphine: impact on neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) outcomes in a single center retrospective study [^111vRgtt]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis of a large single-center cohort of infants NOWS, treatment with sublingual buprenorphine was associated with significantly shorter treatment days and hospital stay compared to treatment with traditional oral morphine. The use of adjunct medications, specifically phenobarbital and clonidine, did not differ significantly between the buprenorphine and morphine-treated groups, suggesting similar efficacy in managing withdrawal symptoms.

### Role of buprenorphine in the management of heroin addiction [^1176w69t]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review buprenorphine and explore its role in the treatment of heroin dependence.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-February 2005) using the key terms buprenorphine, heroin, opioid, addiction, and methadone.

Data Synthesis

Buprenorphine appears to provide potential advantages over methadone. Two Cochrane meta-analyses were evaluated on the use of buprenorphine in opioid dependence-one in the management of opioid dependence and the other in the management of opioid withdrawal.

Conclusions

Buprenorphine offers several advantages for the treatment of heroin addiction. As maintenance treatment, buprenorphine is effective, but not more effective than methadone. In the management of opioid withdrawal, buprenorphine may be better tolerated than clonidine or methadone.

### Opioid taper practices among clinicians [^115QMBVc]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Dr. Jennifer Schneider wrote, in Practical Pain Management, that the addition of clonidine to a taper protocol can allow for a faster taper and that patients who are being tapered because their pain has resolved (ie hip or knee replacement) can tolerate a faster taper than those with chronic pain. Notably, our results showed that few providers utilized pharmacotherapy to blunt the symptoms of withdrawal, despite this being one of few recommendations identified in the literature for safe opioid tapering. Proposed taper protocols often emphasize that the longer a patient has been on opioid therapy the longer the interval between dose reductions should be. A 2019 qualitative study of patients taking opioids identified three overarching themes that have impacted patient's lives when they are faced with an opioid taper – deepening of stigma, loss of autonomy, and an increase in pre-existing structural vulnerabilities among patients who take opioids. These represent unintended consequences of the misapplication of currently available guidance and further reinforce the authors' hypothesis that increased morbidity and mortality could result from the lack of high-quality evidence based guidelines available. What is apparent from a review of the literature coupled with the results of this, albeit small, study is that there is a multitude of approaches to tapering patients off of opioid therapy. Vast interindividual variability among patients and providers alike reminds us that patient centered care should remain at the core of all practices. It provides further support for an individualized approach to opioid tapering. In sum, the array of different resources available and lack of one reliable consensus guideline regarding opioid taper recommendations is likely responsible for the vast variability among provider tapering practices.

### Pharmacokinetic modeling and model-based hypothesis generation for dose optimization of clonidine in neonates with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^114jksyD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically used pharmacological treatment protocols in NOWS have been largely empirical, but there has been increasing effort to use pharmacokinetically optimized dosing to improve treatment outcomes. Pediatric PopPK models for clonidine were previously reported by Potts et al.and Xie et al. However, there have been no reports on model‐based optimization of clonidine dosing in NOWS.

In the No‐POPPY study, the duration of treatment did not differ significantly between clonidine and morphine groups (median [95% CI]: 17 [15, 19] days vs. 15 [13, 17] days). However, clonidine appeared to have a slower onset of action and required more frequent use of adjunct therapy (45% vs. 10% in the morphine arm, P < 0.0001). While patient symptoms improved during the initial treatment phase, these observations indicated the need to optimize the clonidine regimen's dose‐escalation phase. In contrast to the slower onset of action, clonidine‐treated infants had consistently lower Finnegan scores after day 6, when compared with those treated with morphine. Here, we performed a PopPK analysis of clonidine in NOWS and evaluated the effect of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on clonidine disposition. We then performed a parametric TTE analysis in the presence of time‐varying covariates to generate model‐based hypotheses for clonidine dosing optimization, which could be prospectively evaluated in future NOWS trials.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^114mQGuC]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Management of patients with untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) after trauma focuses on treating symptoms of opioid withdrawal and treating acute pain associated with the injury. The amount of opioid required will depend on the severity of the OUD and the severity of the injury. An IV opioid via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, or short-acting oral opioid are both suitable for treating acute pain and addressing opioid withdrawal, and PCA may be safer and easier to titrate in the initial treatment phase, if the patient is able to use the device. Adjunctive drugs, including clonidine, gabapentin, and ketamine may help pain management. Consider prompt referral to inpatient addiction medicine services even in the early phase of trauma care; inpatient initiation of OUD treatment was found to be feasible and effective.

### Clonidine as monotherapy for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a randomized trial [^116KtreR]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized trial comparing the clonidine and morphine treatment of NOWS, we found no significant differences in LOT and LOS. However, nearly one-half of the infants treated with clonidine received adjunct therapy. The FS decreased with the initiation of treatment, but the decrease in scores in clonidine-treated babies lagged behind that of morphine-treated infants by 1 to 2 days, resulting in the initiation of adjunct therapy. Initially, clonidine-treated infants had worse neurobehavioral performance scores but were no longer different from morphine-treated infants at treatment completion within similar intervals between the initial and final assessments.

The lack of difference in LOT between groups is notable, considering a larger proportion of clonidine-treated babies receiving adjunct therapy and adjustment for multiple factors. We were able to successfully provide an opioid-sparing medication-assisted treatment regimen to a cohort of infants with significant NOWS. This use of non-opioids may be extended for conditions other than NOWS, such as for the relief of chronic pain or in postoperative states.

A high proportion of clonidine-treated infants needing adjunct therapy is a concern. However, this could be addressed by adjusting the dosing schedule. On the basis of our pilot trial results of conservatively starting clonidine dosing at 0.5 µg/kg, published data, and a plan to monitor possible adverse events, we started clonidine at 1 µg/kg. Considering that the estimated half-life of clonidine in a neonate is 14 hours, compared with 6.5 hours, for morphine, it is reasonable to assume that the maximum pharmacologic effects would be near the time of achieving steady-state, which is typically 5-fold the agent's half-life, or ∼70 hours for clonidine and ∼32 hours for morphine. This is consistent with the lag in the decrease of FS by 1 to 2 days with clonidine treatment. Conversely, the subsequent trend of lower mean FS with clonidine treatment probably reflects achieving a steady state. This delayed onset of efficacy for clonidine likely necessitated dose escalations and adjunct medication. We are currently examining our pharmacokinetics data to optimize the dosing regimen with clonidine to shorten the time to steady state.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116mp8ZM]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT WE SHOULD DO

We should assess patients for risk of opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, including methadone, in patients who select it. For patients without a formal OUD diagnosis who want to continue methadone after discharge, confirm the diagnosis using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Start and titrate methadone (Table 1) when patients endorse early opioid withdrawal symptoms after confirming they have opioid tolerance and are not actively sedated. Because methadone is a full opioid agonist and can be initiated before withdrawal develops it is unnecessary to obtain a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score when starting it. We should also offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) for withdrawal, though these do not address the underlying pathophysiology of opioid withdrawal and insufficiently mitigate symptoms. Clinicians should recognize that patients using fentanyl or other potent synthetic opioids may have high tolerance and need higher doses of opioid agonists, including methadone, to alleviate withdrawal. When patients decline methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal, their opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain are not controlled on methadone or buprenorphine alone, or they are undergoing low-dose buprenorphine initiation, hospitalists can offer alternative opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) during hospitalization though we cannot prescribe these medications for withdrawal at discharge.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^114XrCiG]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Assess current medication

All medications should be evaluated and discussed. This includes prescribed pharmacotherapy, over-the-counter medicines, alternative treatments, supplements and illicit/recreational drugs (including cannabis).

Analgesic consumption must be carefully evaluated. Frequent use of all types of pain-relieving drugs, in particular triptans, ergotamine, opioids, caffeine, meprobamate and codeine-containing products, may be associated with rebound headache, which itself is associated with greater pain-related disability. Withdrawal of treatment often leads to improvement and evolution to episodic headache. Where chronic headache does not resolve with withdrawal of analgesics, the patient should be referred for specialist assessment.

Opioids should be tapered and discontinued

Where patients who present with ongoing pain of uncertain etiology are already on long-term opioids, the dose should be carefully tapered and the opioid should preferably be discontinued. This includes combination analgesic formulations containing codeine and/or meprobamate, which are commonly used and may be available over-the-counter.

While careful tapering and discontinuation of opioids may take time, and both patients and health care professionals may be reluctant to withdraw any medication they perceive to be pain-relieving, in patients with chronic pain it is generally an essential step if pain is to be effectively managed. Opioid withdrawal itself can result in clinically meaningful pain relief.

The opioid dose should be reduced slowly by approximately 10% per week, or more slowly in patients who are anxious or who are suspected of being physically dependent on opioids. When one-third of the original dose is reached, reduce the rate of tapering to one half or less of the initial rate. With careful tapering, withdrawal symptoms in patients with chronic pain are less common and less severe than those which occur in people with opioid addiction and, if they do occur can usually be managed symptomatically. Where there is an increase in pain during tapering, dose reduction should be discontinued and consideration could be given to temporarily increasing the current dose before beginning the tapering process again. Buprenorphine substitution and clonidine may be helpful for more severe withdrawal symptoms and buprenorphine also for acute pain during opioid withdrawal.

Care must be taken to ensure that the patient is not lost to follow-up during the time taken for opioid withdrawal. Patients should be provided with written instructions, dates for follow-up consultations and encouraged to ask questions so that their concerns are addressed. Where a reasonable attempt to withdraw the opioid is not successful, the patient should be referred to a pain clinician.

### Pannexin-1 channel inhibition alleviates opioid withdrawal in rodents by modulating locus coeruleus to spinal cord circuitry [^1157u57A]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Current interventions for opioid withdrawal and opioid use disorder are limited and often rely on opioid replacement therapy. Lofexidine or clonidine are the current and most commonly prescribed non-opioid medications for managing withdrawal symptoms. They act centrally on α 2 -adrenergic receptors, which inhibit normal autonomic function resulting in adverse effects: CNS depression, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and withdrawal symptoms can occur when treatment is terminated. Our findings provide potential therapeutic strategies for treating withdrawal through (1) the repurposing and expediated use of probenecid, a clinically approved drug with a well-established safety profile, and (2) our Panx1-inhibiting lead compound EG- 2184. Although EG-2184 is more potent than probenecid at inhibiting Panx1 currents and dye flux, the effective dose of this compound and its delivery in oral or other clinical formulations will require further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic optimisation. Indeed, both probenecid and EG-2184 produced a striking reduction in opioid withdrawal and suppressed cue-induced reinstatement, a model for opioid seeking and relapse, notably without producing significant adverse effects. Thus, strategies directed at blocking Panx1 to disrupt aberrant LC-NE-spinal cord signalling may be effective in treating opioid withdrawal and curbing relapse in opioid use and misuse. Finally, these mechanistic findings may also have important implications for other medications in which aberrant autonomic output of the LC is a key feature.

### Lofexidine, an { alpha } 2-receptor agonist for opioid detoxification [^114uDuGk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage guidelines for lofexidine, an alpha(2)-agonist, for opioid detoxification.

Data Sources

Primary literature was identified through a MEDLINE search (1950-September 2009), EMBASE (1988-July 2009), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2009), and the Cochrane Library (1996-September 2009) using the key words lofexidine and opioid withdrawal. Abstracts were included in the absence of published results of studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies published in English-language literature reporting on animal and human pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics were included in addition to clinical trials using lofexidine for opioid detoxification in comparison to placebo or active controls.

Data Synthesis

Lofexidine is an alpha(2)-agonist structurally related to clonidine. It is not an effective antihypertensive agent; however, it decreases the sympathetic outflow responsible for many opioid withdrawal symptoms. Nine clinical studies were reviewed representing 354 patients receiving lofexidine including a recent Phase 3 clinical trial. Eight studies involved comparisons of lofexidine to an opioid receptor agonist or clonidine for opioid detoxification. In these trials, lofexidine dosing was titrated to a maximum of 1.6–3.2 mg/day in divided doses for a total of 5–18 days. The data suggest that lofexidine has positive efficacy in reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms and is at least as effective as the opioid receptor agonists utilized for detoxification. Not all withdrawal symptoms are alleviated by alpha(2)-agonists, with many patients complaining of insomnia and aching. The most common adverse event with lofexidine in the Phase 3 trial was insomnia. Hypotension was also reported; however, the studies comparing clonidine with lofexidine suggest decreased incidence and severity of adverse events with lofexidine.

Conclusions

Lofexidine appears to be a promising agent for opioid detoxification. If approved, it would be the first nonopioid agent approved for this indication. Further large-scale controlled studies are needed to identify the safest, most effective dosage regimen required to achieve opioid detoxification.

### Clonidine for sedation in the critically ill: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115PLrUH]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane trial registry from inception until March 2016 (Appendix 1). No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently screened all references for inclusion and a third party resolved discrepancies. We identified unpublished and ongoing trials using the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov databases. Conference proceedings for the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), Canadian Critical Care Society, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) were screened in duplicate for the last 2 years.

Study selection

No methodological quality restrictions were imposed. Although non-randomized prospective studies were identified in the initial search, a sufficient number of RCTs were identified such that only RCT data were subsequently analyzed and reported. Eligible studies were RCTs reporting the use of clonidine, either as a primary sedative or adjunctive agent, compared to any non-clonidine sedative regimen, in patients who required IMV. Studies that used clonidine for any indication other than sedation (e.g. opioid withdrawal) were excluded. We excluded studies enrolling only neonates and those in which clonidine was administered by a route other than enteral or intravenous (IV).

We included studies that reported any of our a priori outcomes, namely the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), all-cause mortality, duration of sedative infusion, dose of benzodiazepines or narcotics used during ICU stay, the level of sedation, incidence of withdrawal from other sedatives, incidence of delirium, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Adverse events were also captured, including clinically significant bradycardia and hypotension requiring intervention, clonidine withdrawal symptoms (rebound hypertension), the unplanned removal of support lines and unplanned extubation.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to November week 2, 2015), EMBASE (January 1985 to November week 2, 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to November week 2, 2015), Web of Science, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. We assessed 10 studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one of the methodological domains that were considered. We found moderate-quality evidence that alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants). Peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists than with reducing doses of methadone, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants; low quality), and peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants; moderate quality), but these differences were not significant and there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants; moderate quality). The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants; low quality). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants; low quality), but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants; low quality). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. We detected no significant difference in efficacy between treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, but methadone was associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^111mX8je]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 3: Treating Opioid Withdrawal

Using medications for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids. Abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings, which can lead to continued use.

Patients should be advised about risk of relapse and other safety concerns from using opioid withdrawal management as standalone treatment for opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method.

Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal.

Opioid withdrawal management in cases in which methadone is used to manage withdrawal symptoms must be done in an inpatient setting or in an OTP. For short-acting opioids, tapering schedules that decrease in daily doses of prescribed methadone should begin with doses between 20 and 30 mg per day, and should be completed in 6–10 days.

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

The use of combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to manage withdrawal and facilitate the accelerated introduction of extended-release injectable naltrexone has shown promise. More research will be needed before this can be accepted as standard practice.

The Guideline Committee recommends, based on consensus opinion, the inclusion of clonidine as a practice to support opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not US FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, but it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine may be used orally or transdermally at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily to assist in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a delay in response using transdermal clonidine that may require oral supplementation on day 1. Its hypotensive effects often limit the amount that can be used. Clonidine can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, and ondansetron or other agents for nausea.

Opioid withdrawal management using anesthesia – ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD) – is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be a well tolerated and effective approach, but should be used only by clinicians experienced in this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation is not being employed.

### Evaluation of the effects of lofexidine and clonidine on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in opioid-dependent humans [^111ur1TP]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the efficacy of lofexidine, an alpha2 adrenergic agonist, to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent humans under in-patient laboratory conditions by using a naloxone challenge procedure.

Design

Randomized, within-subject, cross-over design with drug administration taking place under double-blind and triple-dummy conditions.

Setting

A 14-bed in-patient hospital research unit dedicated to the conduct of behavioral pharmacology studies.

Participants

Eight healthy adult volunteers (two female/six male) with histories of polysubstance abuse and current physical dependence on opioids.

Intervention

Participants were stabilized onto methadone and maintained on 30 mg/day, p.o. throughout the study. Oral placebo, lofexidine (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg, p.o.) and clonidine (0.1 and 0.2 mg, p.o.) were each tested as pre-treatments once in combination with each of three intramuscular naloxone doses (0, 0.1 and 0.3 mg, i.m.) during 18 separate experimental sessions.

Measurements

An array of physiological indices (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, pupil diameter) as well as a number of subjective and observer-rating scales sensitive to opioid withdrawal effects.

Findings

As expected, lofexidine and clonidine both produced dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate but few subjective effects; naloxone increased opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Although both lofexidine and clonidine reduced the cardiovascular response to naloxone challenge, close inspection of the data reveal that this occurred only to the extent that baseline physiological parameters were reduced, while neither drug significantly modified the overall magnitude of the response to naloxone. Moreover, neither lofexidine nor clonidine suppressed the subjective discomfort of opioid withdrawal or significantly reduced other autonomic signs of opioid withdrawal, such as lacrimation or rhinorrhea.

Conclusions

These data suggest that lofexidine is well tolerated even at supratherapeutic acute doses. However, its failure to modify most signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal suggest that its effective use in spontaneous withdrawal will require concomitant medications for improved therapeutic response.

### Treatment of neonatal withdrawal with clonidine after long-term, high-dose maternal use of tramadol [^115Mi5mp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of tramadol withdrawal in a neonate and treatment with clonidine after exposure to long-term maternal use of high-dose tramadol.

Case Summary

A 34-week gestational age neonate displayed symptoms of tramadol withdrawal within 48 hours of delivery. Due to a confusing initial clinical picture, including presumed congenital Chlamydia, questionable seizures, and an original report of maternal use of ketorolac (Toradol), diagnosis was delayed until day of life 5. Symptoms included jitteriness, myoclonic movements, and irritability. Upon further questioning of the mother, it was revealed that she was actually taking tramadol 600–800 mg daily. The infant was placed on maintenance therapy with oral clonidine (from 1 to 3 microg/kg orally every 3 hours) until discontinuation on day of life 11. After 3 days off treatment, he began to display symptoms of withdrawal again. Clonidine was restarted at 1 microg/kg orally every 8 hours and he was discharged home on maintenance clonidine therapy at 18 days postnatal age. A 7-day tapering regimen was initiated 2 weeks after discharge, and no further withdrawal symptoms occurred.

Discussion

Few published articles are available to guide clinicians on the clinical course and treatment strategies for tramadol dependence and withdrawal. In neonates, the reports are particularly sparse. Traditional agents used in neonatal opioid withdrawal are narcotics (morphine, tincture of opium, methadone), benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam), and phenobarbital. Clonidine use for neonatal abstinence syndrome from narcotics has been shown to be effective alone or in combination with agents such as other opiates and chloral hydrate. Potential benefits of clonidine therapy include shorter duration of therapy, reduced withdrawal symptoms, and decreased length of hospital stay.

Conclusions

Withdrawal can be prolonged in infants exposed to maternal tramadol use. Clonidine may be a safe and effective option for managing symptoms of neonatal tramadol abstinence.

### Safety and efficacy of lofexidine for medically managed opioid withdrawal: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113pfU2r]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, FDA-approved medications for treatment of OUD currently consist of an opioid agonist (methadone), a partial opioid agonist (buprenorphine), and an opioid antagonist (naltrexone). Although methadone and buprenorphine are effective OATs for management of OUD, they are controlled substances with limitations that include restricted access and availability, potential for misuse and diversion, and barriers to acceptability in certain arenas, such as criminal justice settings. These treatments have also been discouraged and stigmatized among some patient subpopulations, including those involved in 12-step mutual help programs. Furthermore, patients may have residual symptoms during initiation of OAT or during agonist-assisted withdrawal, and may benefit from augmentation, and augmentation with an α 2 -adrenergic agonist has been used to prolong abstinence in buprenorphine-maintained patients with a putative mechanism of amelioration of stress-induced relapse, consistent with its mechanism as a sympatholytic. Nonopioid treatment of OWS is helpful before transition to naltrexone in order to limit risk of precipitating OWS and may shorten the time to initiation of naltrexone.

Lofexidine may have advantages over opioid-based medications for withdrawal management when these are not suitable for certain patients and may provide synergistic benefits when they are inadequate alone. Clonidine will likely have cost advantages over lofexidine (as does any older, generic medication over a newly introduced medication), but although it is routinely prescribed for OWS, it is not FDA-approved for OWS, and therefore does not have OWS labeling, and has not been well-studied to determine appropriate dosing guidelines. Although clonidine likely has similar efficacy, its key clinical limitations include the need for individualized "trial-and-error" dosing to balance efficacy and side effects, which include significant sedation and hypotension and potential for rebound hypertension. By contrast, the current study suggests that lofexidine doses up to 2.88 mg/d are well-tolerated without the need for dose titration, sedation rates are low, and rebound hypertension was not a significant clinical concern requiring treatment in the lofexidine clinical trials.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to alpha-2 agonists, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider administering α-2 agonists, such as clonidine (outpatient and inpatient) and dexmedetomidine (inpatient), as an adjunct to benzodiazepines to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when symptoms are not controlled by benzodiazepines alone.

Effectiveness of buprenorphine in opioid withdrawal — an updated Cochrane review assessed 27 studies and concluded that compared with clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine recipients had less severe signs and symptoms, fewer adverse effects, and were more likely to stay in treatment longer, and that buprenorphine is probably similar in effectiveness to tapered doses of methadone. A 2010 meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials found buprenorphine and methadone the most effective methods of detoxification, with treatment durations ranging from 3 to 30 days; a Class III systematic review reported that slow tapering of long-acting opioids can reduce withdrawal severity and that seventeen of the 23 studies were inpatient, limiting ED applicability.

### Alpha2 adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112YKvFY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine) to manage opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched and relevant pharmaceutical companies contacted.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing alpha2 adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2 adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all four reviewers.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies, involving 1709 participants, were included. Eighteen were randomised controlled trials; for the remaining studies allocation was by participant choice in two, one used alternate allocation and in one the method of allocation was unclear. Twelve studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2 adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. For the comparison of alpha2 adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to, or marginally greater with alpha2 adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. No significant difference was detected in rates of completion of withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared to reducing doses of methadone, or clonidine compared to lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects (low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth, lack of energy) than reducing doses of methadone. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Reviewers' Conclusions

No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimes based on the alpha2 adrenergic agonists clonidine and lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes and experience less adverse effects. The lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to use in outpatient settings than clonidine. There are insufficient data available to support a conclusion on the efficacy of other alpha2 adrenergic agonists.

### Efficacy of tramadol extended-release for opioid withdrawal: a randomized clinical trial [^111SSmxa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health problem. Supervised withdrawal (ie, detoxification) from opioids using clonidine or buprenorphine hydrochloride is a widely used treatment.

Objective

To evaluate whether tramadol hydrochloride extended-release (ER), an approved analgesic with opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action and low abuse potential, is effective for use in supervised withdrawal settings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a residential research setting with 103 participants with OUD. Participants' treatment was stabilized with morphine, 30 mg, administered subcutaneously 4 times daily. A 7-day taper using clonidine (n = 36), tramadol ER (n = 36), or buprenorphine (n = 31) was then instituted, and patients were crossed-over to double-blind placebo during a post-taper period. The study was conducted from October 25, 2010, to June 23, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Retention, withdrawal symptom management, concomitant medication utilization, and naltrexone induction. Results were analyzed over time and using area under the curve for the intention-to-treat and completer groups.

Results

Of the 103 participants, 88 (85.4%) were men and 43 (41.7%) were white; mean (SD) age was 28.9 (10.4) years. Buprenorphine participants (28 [90.3%]) were significantly more likely to be retained at the end of the taper compared with clonidine participants (22 [61.1%]); tramadol ER retention was intermediate and did not differ significantly from that of the other groups (26 [72.2%]; χ² = 8.5, P = 0.01). Time-course analyses of withdrawal revealed significant effects of phase (taper, post taper) for the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score (taper mean, 5.19 [SE, .26]; post-taper mean, 3.97 [SE, .23]; F₂,₁₇₀ = 3.6, P = 0.03) and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) score (taper mean,8.81 [SE, .40]; post-taper mean, 4.14 [SE, .30]; F₂,₁₇₀ = 15.7, P < .001), but no group effects or group×phase interactions. Analyses of area under the curve of SOWS total scores showed significant reductions (F2,159 = 17.7, P < .001) in withdrawal severity between the taper and post-taper periods for clonidine (taper mean, 13.1; post-taper mean, 3.2; P < .001) and tramadol ER (taper mean, 7.4; post-taper mean, 2.8; p = 0.03), but not buprenorphine (taper mean, 6.4; post-taper mean, 7.4). Use of concomitant medication increased significantly (F2,159 = 30.7, P < .001) from stabilization to taper in the clonidine (stabilization mean, 0.64 [SE, .05]; taper mean, 1.54 [SE, .10]; P < .001) and tramadol ER (stabilization mean, 0.53 [SE, .05]; taper mean, 1.19 [SE, .09]; p = 0.003) groups and from stabilization to post taper in the buprenorphine group (stabilization mean, 0.46 [SE, .05] post-taper mean, 1.17 [SE, .09]; p = 0.006), suggesting higher withdrawal for those groups during those periods. Naltrexone initiation was voluntary and the percentage of participants choosing naltrexone therapy within the clonidine (8 [22.2%]), tramadol ER (7 [19.4%]), or buprenorphine (3 [9.7%]) groups did not differ significantly (χ2 = 2.5, P = 0.29).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this trial suggest that tramadol ER is more effective than clonidine and comparable to buprenorphine in reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms during a residential tapering program. Data support further examination of tramadol ER as a method to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.

### Clonidine as monotherapy for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: a randomized trial [^113sJ5Eh]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE

We sought to determine whether clonidine, a non-opioid α−2-adrenergic agonist, would effectively treat neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).

METHODS

This was an intention-to-treat randomized clinical trial. Enrollment criteria included prenatal opioid exposure, age ≤ 7 days, gestational age ≥ 35 weeks, no other medical condition, and need for pharmacotherapy. Primary outcomes were length of treatment and neurobehavioral performance.

RESULTS

A total of 1107 patients were screened for enrollment (645 ineligible, 91 parents or staff unavailable, 216 declined, 155 consented). Of 155 infants, 120 required treatment and were randomized to receive oral clonidine (n = 60) at 1 µg/kg/dose or morphine (n = 60), 0.06 mg/kg/dose, every 3 hours. Infants with no improvement had their doses increased by 25% of the initial dose every 12 to 24 hours. Those without improvement by the fourth dose increase, received adjunct therapy. Length of treatment did not differ between morphine and clonidine, with median (95% confidence interval [CI]) days, respectively, of 15 (13–17) and 17 (15–19), P = 0.48. More clonidine-treated infants (45%) needed adjunct therapy versus 10% in the morphine group, adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 8.85 (2.87–27.31). After treatment completion, the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales summary scores did not differ between clonidine-treated and morphine-treated infants.

CONCLUSIONS

Length of pharmacologic treatment and final neurobehavioral performance were not significantly different between the clonidine- and morphine-treated groups. Clonidine appears to be an effective non-opioid medication to treat NOWS. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal clonidine dosage for a quicker response and obviation of adjunct therapy.

### Update on the pharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence syndrome [^112xAspV]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Although a statement on Neonatal Drug Withdrawal was published in 1998 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, pharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) remains a challenge. Published clinical trials are limited, restricting treatment decision making to practitioner's experience and preference rather than evidence-based medicine. To optimize withdrawal symptom prevention, drug selection is often based on the offending agent (opioids versus polysubstance exposure), clinical presentation, mechanism of action (agonist versus partial agonist/antagonist, receptor effects), pharmacokinetic parameters and available drug formulations. This review addresses risk factors and pathophysiology of NAS, summarizes parameters of common drugs used for the management of NAS, and reviews published literature of standard therapies as well as newer agents. Based on the current literature, paregoric is no longer recommended and oral morphine solutions remain the mainstay of therapy for opiate withdrawal. Other potential therapies include methadone, buprenorphine, phenobarbital and clonidine with the latter two agents as adjunctive therapies.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Clonidine is an effective non‐opioid medication for treating neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS).
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Using data from the No‐POPPY trial, this study sought to use a population modeling approach to describe the pharmacokinetics of clonidine in NOWS and use a parametric time‐to‐event approach to optimize clonidine dosing guided by the clinical outcome.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

The study reported a population pharmacokinetic model that described the observed clonidine concentrations in neonates with NOWS. Based on the developed time‐to‐event model, alternative dosing regimens with increased initial and maximum dosages (12 and 24 μg/kg/day, respectively) were proposed to address the delayed onset of efficacy observed in the clinical trial.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113exgX4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine — indications, tapering guidance, contraindications, cautions, interactions, and regulatory warnings: Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist available in a variety of formulations and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, and it is also an effective treatment for opioid withdrawal with efficacy similar to methadone and superior to lofexidine or clonidine in opioid withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If tapering is chosen, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and insufficient evidence is available on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose; one trial found that longer courses of buprenorphine with gradual tapering were superior to rapid tapering for withdrawal. Buprenorphine is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any component of the formulation and patients with severe liver impairment are not good candidates for office-based treatment, while patients with hepatitis C infection who do not have severe liver impairment may be considered for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine should be used with caution for patients with current or past hepatic dysfunction, noting a direct comparison with methadone found no difference in incidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver damage during the initial 6 months in either treatment groups and that monitoring liver enzymes may be considered, and caution also applies to patients who, at present, have an alcohol use or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and to those with hypovolemia, severe cardiovascular disease, or taking drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects because buprenorphine may cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Significant interactions include that alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressive effect of buprenorphine and that buprenorphine is metabolized to nor-buprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4, so concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored and may require dose reduction of one or both agents. In 2016, based on literature reviews and reported adverse events, the FDA required the addition of warnings on all opioid product labels, including methadone and buprenorphine.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2009), Medline (January 1966 to 11 August 2009), Embase (January 1985 to 2009 Week 32), PsycINFO (1967 to July 2009), and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Controlled studies of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia in opioid-dependent participants compared with other approaches, or a different regime of anaesthesia-based antagonist-induced withdrawal.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion, undertook data extraction and assessed quality. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all authors.

Main Results

Nine studies (eight randomised controlled trials) involving 1109 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawal than withdrawal managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications. The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. There is a significantly greater risk of adverse events with heavy, compared to light, sedation (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.12, P = 0.03) and probably with this approach compared to other forms of detoxification.

Authors' Conclusions

Heavy sedation compared to light sedation does not confer additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of commencement on naltrexone maintenance treatment. Given that the adverse events are potentially life-threatening, the value of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is not supported. The high cost of anaesthesia-based approaches, both in monetary terms and use of scarce intensive care resources, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^115pYf2b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal — onset and management in the emergency department notes that onset from the last exposure varies by opioid and amount, nominally 12 hours for heroin and up to 30 hours for methadone. Treatment may be symptomatic with α2-adrenergic agonists such as clonidine or lofexidine, plus antiemetics and atypical antipsychotics, but appropriate use of buprenorphine or methadone effectively alleviates withdrawal symptoms, and initial dosing may also serve to initiate medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for OUD.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114Tm2xi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pharmacotherapy options outlines that the medications covered include those approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid use disorder, that FDA approvals have primarily been for "opioid dependence" as defined in prior DSM versions, and that pharmacologic treatment may not be appropriate for all patients along the opioid use disorder continuum; in one study optimal concordance occurred when four or more DSM-5 criteria were endorsed, the DSM-5 threshold for moderate opioid use disorder. Medications to be discussed include methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, naloxone, lofexidine, and clonidine; since 2015, in May 2018 the FDA approved the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist lofexidine as a treatment for withdrawal symptoms when opioids are abruptly discontinued, whereas clonidine is described as not FDA-approved for opioid use disorder and commonly used off-label for opioid withdrawal. Key outcomes for evaluating efficacy include decreased mortality, abstinence from opioids, and retention in treatment; a 2016 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis found no difference between methadone and buprenorphine in retaining patients in treatment, reducing illicit opioid use or in reported adverse events, and a 2016 CADTH review found methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone equally effective in reducing mortality, with buprenorphine/naloxone more likely to produce abstinence while more patients on methadone were retained in treatment.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^1145dniz]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Patients on low-dose prescription opioids (< 20 mg oral morphine equivalents) and/or for a short duration (< 2–3 weeks) can generally discontinue without tapering. In other patients, tapering is advised. More rapid tapering generally results in more severe withdrawal and lower success rates. The advised rate of discontinuation in guidelines ranges between 10% per month and 50% per week of the initial dose, with slower tapers (i.e. 10% reduction per month) being more likely to be better tolerated. If rapid discontinuation of opioids is necessary for medical reasons, reduction strategies of up to 50% per week are possible. Switching to long-acting opioids (usually 70% dose-equivalent) can be considered with high doses (> 90 mg morphine equivalents) and/or prolonged opioid use (> 3 months), but also in patients with prior failed discontinuation attempts. Long-acting opioids should be tapered to the lowest possible dose, and then discontinued.

Dose reduction

Discontinuation should be the primary goal in patients using opioids for analgesic purposes. Nevertheless, in patients at high risk of relapse (high opioid doses, long-time use, either with or without opioid use disorder), long-acting opioid agonist treatment (e.g. methadone or buprenorphine) can be considered. In patients on agonist treatment, dose reduction strategies are recommended when adverse events develop, or in the event of pharmacokinetic changes, e.g. due to co-medication, successful treatment of hepatitis, or ageing.

Discontinuation interventions

Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with opioid use disorder result in lower perceived pain and focus on analgesics. Such strategies may facilitate discontinuation of opioids, although evidence is lacking. There is limited evidence for clonidine for agitation, shaking and muscle ache, anti-emetics for nausea, and loperamide for diarrhea. For insomnia, benzodiazepines should be given with caution in this patient group, due to their risk of developing sedative use disorder.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1176brrG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g. for patients who have experienced overdose on their current dosage). However, unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages. Sudden discontinuation might precipitate substantial opioid withdrawal. Rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients also can increase risks for psychological distress and opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Ultrarapid detoxification under anesthesia is associated with substantial risks, including death, and should not be used.

Management of Opioid Withdrawal During Tapering

The first approach to withdrawal symptoms and signs should generally be consideration of slowing or pausing the taper rate. If needed, short-term oral medications might also help manage withdrawal symptoms. These include alpha-2 agonists for the management of autonomic signs and symptoms (e.g. sweating and tachycardia). Alpha-2 agonists clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo in reducing severity of withdrawal from heroin or methadone in the context of abrupt (not gradual) discontinuation. Similar research could not be found on clonidine and lofexidine in patients tapering from long-term opioid treatment for pain; however, alpha-2 agonist tizanidine has been used to help taper patients from long-term, high-dosage opioids for chronic pain. Other medications addressing specific symptoms (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or topical menthol or methyl salicylate for muscle aches; trazodone for sleep disturbance; prochlorperazine, promethazine, or ondansetron for nausea; dicyclomine for abdominal cramping; and loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea) also have been used.

### Thresholds for adjunctive medication usage and probability of initiating injectable naltrexone [^112hvNji]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the effectiveness of different thresholds for administering opioid withdrawal medications (clonidine and clonazepam) on the probability of successfully initiating extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) among participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) during medically managed withdrawal.

Design

Secondary analysis of a multisite clinical trial comparing a rapid vs. standard approach for XR-NTX initiation, 2021–2022.

Setting

Six community inpatient addiction treatment units in the United States.

Participants

English-speaking adults seeking treatment for DSM-5 OUD and expressing interest in XR-NTX treatment (n = 415).

Measurements

We estimated the extent to which the following thresholds for adjunctive medication administration would affect the probability of initiating XR-NTX over time: 1) where adjunctive medications were given in response to at mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms or greater [Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score ≥ 5), 2) where adjunctive medications were given in response to minimal withdrawal symptoms or greater (COWS score ≥ 3) and 3) where adjunctive medications were given regardless of withdrawal symptoms. Using a longitudinal sequentially doubly robust estimator, we estimated the cumulative probability of XR-NTX initiation under each of these three treatment regimes while accounting for dropout and initiation of other medications as competing events.

Findings

The estimated probability of initiating XR-NTX by day 14 was 50.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.8–58.9) under the no-threshold regime, 43.9% (95% CI = 39.1–48.7) under the regime of waiting for minimal withdrawal symptoms and 38.5% (95% CI = 34.3–42.6) under the regime of waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms. Probability of XR-NTX initiation was a statistically significant 11.9 percentage points higher (95% CI = 3.6–20.2) under the no-threshold regime versus the mild-to-moderate threshold regime, and a non-statistically significant 6.4 percentage points (95% CI = -0.8 to 13.7) higher under the no-threshold regime versus the minimal threshold regime.

Conclusions

Providing clonidine and clonazepam daily during the first five days of medically managed opioid withdrawal appears to statistically significantly increase the likelihood of initiating extended-release naltrexone treatment compared with waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms to administer adjunctive medications. To improve initiation rates, providers may consider lowering the threshold at which they provide adjunctive medications, giving these medications preemptively or to manage even minimal withdrawal symptoms.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^114i8Tcv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Modulation of alpha receptors results in widespread effects at both central and peripheral locations. Within the central nervous system, stimulation of alpha 2 autoreceptors within the locus coeruleus reduces calcium channel activity, decreasing presynaptic release of norepinephrine (NE) (6,14,21*). Release of somatotroph hormone is elevated, increasing endogenous alpha 2 receptor activation (II). This has been postulated to reduce fear response to environmental stimuli, instead causing environmental indifference (ataraxia). Reduction of overall NE release decreases autonomic tone, resulting in sedation and anxiolysis. However, the respiratory center is not affected, allowing for sedation without risk of respiratory depression *. Peripherally, clonidine increases NO release from endothelial cells, resulting in vasodilation and a reduction in capillary hydrostatic pressure– especially when applied topically. A global increase in parasympathetic tone and a reduction in inflammation is observed, resulting in a variety of effects, including cardiac sympathetic deactivation. Systemic levels of both renin and catecholamines are reduced. Clonidine does produce analgesia, although the mechanism has not been well-delineated; part may be due to its peripheral effects on spinal cord glutamate release, complemented by the central effect of pain indifference (analgognosia). The overall result of clonidine administration falls under the umbrella of "cooperative sedation", which allows for sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without increasing the risk of delirium. This wide range of effects has resulted in the use of clonidine for a large number of indications in addition to analgesia, including agitation, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, mania, psychosis, delirium, nightmares and hypervigilance associated with PTSD, ADHD, opioid withdrawal, and others that are described below in Table 1.

### Management of xylazine withdrawal in a hospitalized patient: a case report [^116UcTos]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Xylazine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist commonly used as a large animal anesthetic. It is used as an adulterant in illicit opioids, and it is now well established that its synergistic effect with opioids increases lethality. The amount of xylazine adulterating illicit opioids is growing at an alarming rate, present in almost one-third of opioid overdose deaths reported in Philadelphia in 2019. Despite this, there are no reports considering the management of patients using xylazine chronically. In particular, there are no reported cases detailing the management of xylazine withdrawal or exploring the potential for ongoing treatment for those in recovery from xylazine use.

Case Summary

We present the case of a 29 year old female with opioid use disorder and chronic xylazine use, admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of chronic lower extremity wounds thought to be due to xylazine injection. Her xylazine withdrawal was managed with a combination of dexmedetomidine infusion, phenobarbital and tizanidine, later transitioned to clonidine. By hospital day 4 she was no longer experiencing withdrawal symptoms. She was transitioned from full-agonist opioids for pain to buprenorphine via a buprenorphine "micro-induction" and was ultimately discharged on buprenorphine, clonidine, and gabapentin on day 19 of admission.

Clinical Significance

This case illustrates a potential treatment pathway that allows for safe and comfortable xylazine withdrawal in hospitalized patients. It also provides an introduction into several medical concerns affecting this patient population specifically, including xylazine-mediated soft tissue wounds.

Gold MS, Pottash AC, Sweeney DR, Kleber HD. Opiate Withdrawal Using Clonidine: A Safe, Effective, and Rapid Nonopiate Treatment. JAMA. 1980; 243: 343–346. doi: 10.1001/jama.1980.03300300021018 Clonidine hydrochloride was administered to ten patients in an inpatient setting after abrupt discontinuation of chronic methadone hydrochloride administration. Clonidine produced a rapid and statistically significant decrease in opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms. Clonidine administration for 14 days enabled all patients to be successfully detoxified from chronic opiate administration. In all patients studied, clonidine was a safe and effective nonopiate treatment of opiate withdrawal that suppressed the affect, signs, and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. These data support the hypothesis that the α2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, has substantial antiwithdrawal effect by replacing opiate-mediated inhibition with α2-mediated inhibition of brain noradrenergic activity.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^114vX3iC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or with comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms and overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects and completion of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1985 to August week 1, 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to July week 5, 2013) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process.

Main Results

We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57, 3 studies, 148 participants). Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84, 3 studies, 148 participants). Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were somewhat less effective than reducing doses of methadone in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73, 5 studies, 340 participants), peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46, 2 studies, 263 participants) and overall withdrawal severity (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49, 3 studies, 119 participants). These differences were not statistically significant. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83, 3 studies, 310 participants). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10, 6 studies, 464 participants) but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05, 9 studies, 659 participants). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days but methadone is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Continuous intraventricular clonidine infusion in controlled morphine withdrawal – case report [^114rjmah]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

A patient with atypical bilateral facial pain reported the loss of analgesic effect of intracerebroventricular morphine delivered continuously via an implanted pump, accompanied by intolerable adverse side effects associated with the administered high dose of morphine. Clonidine was substituted for morphine over a period of 3 weeks to achieve a drug holiday. The patient did not have significant withdrawal symptoms or major discomfort from pain, leading to a reduced quality of life during this period. Six months after the treatment, the patient continues to require a significantly lower daily dose of morphine. Morphine withdrawal with clonidine substitution produced a significant improvement in the analgesic efficacy of morphine and in the quality of life in the absence of undesirable side effects.

### Detoxification treatments for opiate dependent adolescents [^114hjHEh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The scientific literature examining effective treatments for opioid dependent adults clearly indicates that pharmacotherapy is a necessary and acceptable component of effective treatments for opioid dependence. Nevertheless no studies have been published which systematically assess the effectiveness of the pharmacological detoxification among adolescents.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any detoxification treatment alone or in combination with psychosocial intervention compared to no intervention, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial interventions on completion of treatment, reducing the use of substances and improving health and social status.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2008), CINHAL (January 1982 to August) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing any pharmacological interventions alone or associated with psychosocial intervention aimed at detoxification with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial intervention in adolescents (13–18 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

One trial involving 36 participants was included. It compares buprenorphine with clonidine for detoxification. No difference was found for drop out: RR 0.45 (95%CI: 0.20–1.04) and acceptability of treatment: withdrawal score WMD: 3.97 (95%CI -1.38, 9.32). More participants in the buprenorphine group initiated naltrexone treatment: RR 11.00 [95%CI 1.58, 76.55].

Authors' Conclusions

It is difficult to draft conclusions on the basis of only one trial with few participants. Furthermore, the only study included did not consider the efficacy of methadone that is still the most frequent drug utilized for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. One possible reason for the lack of evidence could be the difficulty in conducting trials with young people for to practical and ethical reasons.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116vwn1q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Assess patients for opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, using shared decision making, regardless of a patient's plan to disrupt opioid use or continue treatment after discharge.
When patients prefer methadone titrate it appropriately (Table 1) recognizing that dosing guidelines may not reflect patient needs in the setting of potent opioids (e.g. fentanyl).
Offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) in addition to opioid agonist therapy to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
Link patients who want to continue methadone to local OTPs on discharge. If there is no accessible OTP, discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to methadone.
Prescribe naloxone and discuss harm reduction as part of overdose prevention.

### Pain in the management of opioid use disorder [^116rsbEb]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Opioids remain the drug of choice for the clinical management of moderate to severe pain. However, in addition to their most effective analgesic actions, opioids also produce a sense of well-being and euphoria, which may trigger significant concerns associated with their use. In fact, there has been an alarming increase in prescription opioid use, abuse and illicit use; and according to the National Center for Health Statistics, the total number of deaths related to opioid overdose has more than tripled from 2011 to 2014.–Although representing 5.0% of the global population, studies report that Americans consume 80% of the global opioid supply, and the United States is experiencing an opioid abuse epidemic. Considering this unprecedented rise in opioid consumption, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has listed prescription opioid overdose among one of the 10 most important public health problems in all the 50 states.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is defined as a repeated manifestation of 2 or more of 11 problems (e.g. strong desire to use an opioid, use of an opioid in increased amounts, continued opioid use despite negative consequences and withdrawal when the dose of an opioid is decreased) within a 12-month period. Recent studies report a shocking increase in emergency room visits and individuals seeking treatment for OUD. Various pharmacotherapies exist for the detoxification or long-term management of OUD, including opioid antagonists (naltrexone), partial agonists (buprenorphine), opioid agonists (methadone), alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine) and psychosocial interventions. A detailed account of these interventions is reviewed elsewhere. While these medications have better efficacy in the management of OUD compared to non-medication interventions, treatment requires long-term management, and a high rate of relapse is a significant concern posttreatment.–

### New directions in the treatment of opioid withdrawal [^112MZEp1]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

The treatment of opioid withdrawal is an important area of clinical concern when treating patients with chronic, non-cancer pain, patients with active opioid use disorder, and patients receiving medication for opioid use disorder. Current standards of care for medically supervised withdrawal include treatment with μ-opioid receptor agonists, (eg, methadone), partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine), and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists (eg, clonidine and lofexidine). Newer agents likewise exploit these pharmacological mechanisms, including tramadol (μ-opioid receptor agonism) and tizanidine (α2 agonism). Areas for future research include managing withdrawal in the context of stabilising patients with opioid use disorder to extended-release naltrexone, transitioning patients with opioid use disorder from methadone to buprenorphine, and tapering opioids in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.

### Opioid antagonists under heavy sedation or anaesthesia for opioid withdrawal [^111uPq7z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term opioid replacement treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the administration of opioid antagonists to induce opioid withdrawal with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia, in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of treatment and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Drugs and Alcohol Group register (October 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), Medline (January 1966 to January 2005), Embase (January 1985 to January 2005), PsycINFO (1967 to January 2005), and Cinahl (1982 to December 2004) and reference lists of studies.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia with another form of treatment, or a different regime of anaesthesia-based antagonist-induced withdrawal.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction and assessed quality. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers.

Main Results

Six studies (five randomised controlled trials) involving 834 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawal than withdrawal managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications. The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. There is a significantly greater risk of adverse events with heavy, compared to light, sedation (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.12, P = 0.03) and probably also other forms of detoxification.

Authors' Conclusions

Heavy sedation compared to light sedation does not confer additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of commencement on naltrexone maintenance treatment. Given that the adverse events are potentially life-threatening, the value of antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anaesthesia is not supported. The high cost of anaesthesia-based approaches, both in monetary terms and use of scarce intensive care resources, suggest that this form of treatment should not be pursued.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^115jEQr3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of maintenance treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, for withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (January 1985 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2005), CINAHL(1982 to July 2005) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Experimental interventions involved the use of buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process was confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers.

Main Results

Eighteen studies (14 randomised controlled trials), involving 1356 participants, were included. Ten studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine; four compared buprenorphine with methadone; one compared buprenorphine with oxazepam; three compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction; two compared different starting doses of buprenorphine. (Two studies included more than one comparison.)Relative to clonidine, buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer, particularly in an outpatient setting (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.06, P < 0.001), and are more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47, P = 0.003). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine. Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. There is a trend towards completion of withdrawal treatment being more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.73, P = 0.08).

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. There appears to be no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of completion of treatment, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine.
