## Question

Can you get carpel tunnel in your neck

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether carpal tunnel syndrome can occur in the neck. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise anatomical definition of carpal tunnel syndrome. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis that can produce similar hand symptoms, especially cervical radiculopathy and degenerative cervical myelopathy. Next, I will review the concept of double crush syndrome and how it influences management. After that, I should check the recommended diagnostic approach, including when to use CTS-6, electrodiagnostics, ultrasound, and cervical imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical pathway and counseling points to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure timely referral when indicated [^115wuSvX] [^117MADkh].

> Let me first confirm the anatomy and pathophysiology. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a compressive neuropathy of the median nerve beneath the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist; by definition, the site of compression is distal in the upper extremity, not in the cervical spine, so CTS cannot originate in the neck anatomically [^115ASJM8] [^111Mh7r9].

> Wait, let me verify the common mimics. Cervical radiculopathy from spondylosis or disc disease can produce hand pain, paresthesias, and weakness that overlap with CTS, and degenerative cervical myelopathy can present with hand numbness, clumsiness, gait imbalance, and hyperreflexia; importantly, DCM is frequently misdiagnosed as CTS, with studies noting delays averaging over two years and multiple consultations before the correct diagnosis, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on CTS when red flags for myelopathy are present [^117MADkh] [^111KCknQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider the double crush phenomenon. The double crush hypothesis posits that proximal nerve compression at the cervical root and distal compression at the carpal tunnel can coexist and synergistically worsen symptoms; recent data suggest patients with concurrent CTS and cervical radiculopathy can still improve after isolated carpal tunnel release, though they carry higher risks of complications and reoperation, so I need to counsel on risk and consider staged or combined strategies when appropriate [^112g8yCT] [^112u9GAF] [^1176nb1U].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. Initially, I thought provocative tests like Spurling's or the upper limb tension test might reliably screen for cervical causes, but wait, I should double-check their performance; evidence shows these cervical provocative tests have low sensitivity and high specificity, meaning they are better for confirming suspected cervical radiculopathy than for screening, so I should not rely on them to exclude neck pathology when suspicion is low [^1158i9hu]. For suspected CTS, the CTS-6 clinical calculator is strongly supported as a diagnostic tool and can reduce unnecessary electrodiagnostics; however, I need to ensure I exclude mimics such as cervical radiculopathy before applying it, as its accuracy drops in mixed presentations [^1164X61D] [^111tezJT]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain or surgery is planned, nerve conduction studies and ultrasound can add value, and if myelopathy or radiculopathy is suspected, cervical MRI is indicated to avoid missing cord compression [^112n6fxz] [^117MADkh].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic management nuances. Guidelines suggest that short-term manual therapy directed at the cervical spine and upper extremity may benefit patients with mild to moderate CTS, but I should confirm that this is adjunctive and not a substitute for definitive management when indicated; neurodynamic mobilization has conflicting evidence, so I should individualize and stop if symptoms worsen [^117EFEVn] [^113V1d3V] [^111GRuPy].

> Next, I should review procedural and surgical decision points. Local corticosteroid injection can provide short-term symptom relief and may reduce near-term surgery rates, but I need to ensure I am not masking a proximal lesion if the presentation is atypical or refractory; when surgery is chosen, carpal tunnel release is effective in most patients, yet in those with concurrent cervical disease, complication and reoperation risks are higher, warranting optimization and staged strategies when feasible [^116JUMUK] [^1176nb1U].

> But wait, what if the patient has bilateral hand symptoms, neck stiffness, gait changes, or hyperreflexia? I should promptly evaluate for degenerative cervical myelopathy because delays worsen outcomes; in such cases, cervical MRI and early spine referral are critical, and relying solely on wrist-level treatment risks persistent disability despite technically successful carpal tunnel release [^117MADkh] [^111KCknQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: CTS cannot occur in the neck because the pathophysiology is at the wrist, yet cervical disorders can mimic CTS and coexist with it; therefore, a careful history and exam, judicious use of CTS-6, selective electrodiagnostics or ultrasound, and cervical imaging when red flags or atypical features arise are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and to guide whether isolated carpal tunnel release or additional cervical management is warranted [^115ASJM8] [^1164X61D] [^112n6fxz] [^117MADkh].

No, you cannot get **carpal tunnel syndrome in your neck** because CTS is a wrist entrapment of the median nerve [^115ASJM8], not a cervical condition. However, **cervical radiculopathy** can mimic CTS with hand numbness or weakness, and the two can coexist as a "double crush" syndrome [^112g8yCT]. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical examination** [^1167eVNJ], **electrodiagnostic studies** [^113JAnxi], and, when needed, **cervical imaging** [^112n6fxz] to distinguish CTS from neck-related causes and guide treatment.

---

## Anatomical distinction between carpal tunnel syndrome and cervical conditions

CTS involves **median nerve compression at the wrist** within the carpal tunnel, causing hand and finger symptoms [^111Mh7r9]. In contrast, **cervical radiculopathy** results from nerve root compression in the neck, often from herniated discs or spondylosis, and can produce similar hand symptoms via shared nerve pathways [^notfound].

---

## Clinical overlap and diagnostic confusion

CTS and cervical radiculopathy can present similarly, leading to diagnostic confusion:

| **Symptom** | **Carpal tunnel syndrome** | **Cervical radiculopathy** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain location | - Wrist <br/> - Palm <br/> - Fingers (thumb, index, middle, radial half of ring) | - Neck <br/> - Shoulder <br/> - Arm <br/> - Hand |
| Sensory symptoms | - Numbness <br/> - Tingling <br/> - Burning in median nerve distribution | - Numbness <br/> - Tingling <br/> - Weakness in dermatomal pattern |
| Motor symptoms | - Thenar weakness <br/> - Atrophy | - Weakness in muscles innervated by affected nerve root |
| Provocative tests | - Phalen <br/> - Tinel <br/> - Carpal compression | - Spurling <br/> - Neck distraction <br/> - Upper limb tension |

---

## Double crush syndrome

Double crush syndrome occurs when **proximal and distal nerve compressions coexist** (e.g. cervical radiculopathy plus CTS), producing more severe or persistent symptoms than either alone [^112g8yCT]. This underscores the need to evaluate both the neck and wrist when symptoms are atypical or refractory [^115wuSvX].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Clinical examination**: Use provocative tests (Phalen, Tinel, carpal compression) [^1167eVNJ] and screen the cervical spine for radiculopathy [^115wuSvX].
- **Electrodiagnostic studies**: Nerve conduction studies and EMG help distinguish CTS from cervical radiculopathy and detect double crush [^113JAnxi].
- **Imaging**: Cervical MRI is indicated when radiculopathy or myelopathy is suspected [^117MADkh] [^112n6fxz]; wrist ultrasound or MRI can assess median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel [^1126FUWP] [^111kgiTM].

---

## Treatment implications

Treatment depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **CTS**: Splinting, corticosteroid injections, and carpal tunnel release surgery are effective [^116JUMUK] [^111Mh7r9].
- **Cervical radiculopathy**: Conservative care (physical therapy, medications) or cervical spine surgery if severe or refractory [^notfound].
- **Double crush**: Address both sites; cervical decompression may be needed if CTS surgery fails or symptoms persist [^112u9GAF].

---

## Conclusion

CTS is a wrist entrapment neuropathy and **cannot originate in the neck** [^notfound], but cervical radiculopathy can mimic or coexist with CTS. Careful evaluation — including clinical examination, electrodiagnostics, and imaging — is essential to distinguish these entities and guide appropriate treatment [^112n6fxz].

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^114qMfRZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, management of CTS has shifted as well. Although for many patients the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide what diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications especially in high-risk patients, and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings in order to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. In this article, we approach commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and take a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^113JAnxi]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are recognised widely and various treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome and to guide treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, but their exact benefit to patients is unknown. Although the best means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.

In September 2008, the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons approved a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. This guideline was subsequently endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The guideline makes nine specific recommendations: A course of nonsurgical treatment is an option in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Early surgery is an option with clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or when the patient so elects. Another nonsurgical treatment or surgery is suggested when the current treatment fails to resolve symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Sufficient evidence is not available to provide specific treatment recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome associated with such conditions as diabetes mellitus and coexistent cervical radiculopathy. Local steroid injection or splinting is suggested before considering surgery. Oral steroids or ultrasound are options. Carpal tunnel release is recommended as treatment. Heat therapy is not among the options to be used. Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome by complete division of the flexor retinaculum is recommended. Routine use of skin nerve preservation and epineurotomy is not suggested when carpal tunnel release is performed. Prescribing preoperative antibiotics for carpal tunnel surgery is an option. It is suggested that the wrist not be immobilized postoperatively after routine carpal tunnel surgery. It is suggested that instruments such as the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire be used to assess patient responses to carpal tunnel syndrome treatment for research.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: updated evidence and new questions [^114JSEhv]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting quality of life for many people. Although it is a well recognised condition, new insights into epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have emerged in the past 6 years. The availability of disease-modifying treatments for rare systemic disorders associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (eg, amyloidosis) should alert clinicians to these diagnostic possibilities. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiology, the role of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool has been confirmed and new ultrasound techniques have been applied, the clinical use and feasibility of which require further investigation. Surgical and non-surgical interventions are beneficial for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and several treatment options are now available, giving clinicians the possibility to choose the best approach for every patient. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require further validation.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117EaeGF]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy in the upper extremity. The condition is responsible for substantial annual costs to society, both in terms of lost productivity and the costs of treatment. Accurate diagnostic criteria, the selection of treatment strategies based on high-level evidence, and outcomes data have been inconsistent despite the prevalence of the condition. The increased awareness of the need for evidence-based practice guidelines has, however, yielded important data to guide treatment of CTS. Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have been developed and should direct the treatment of CTS.

### Patients with and without double crush syndrome achieve similar rates of clinical improvement following carpal tunnel release [^112u9GAF]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of carpal tunnel release (CTR) in patients with and without double crush syndrome (DCS), defined as concurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and cervical radiculopathy at C5-T1 on preoperative nerve conduction studies.

Methods

Patients with preoperative nerve conduction studies who underwent unilateral, isolated CTR were retrospectively identified. All patients completed preoperative and 3-month postoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity (UE) and pain interference (PI), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaires, and responded to the anchor question: "Since your treatment, how would you rate your overall function?" (much worse, worse, slightly worse, no change, slightly improved, improved, much improved). Preoperative, postoperative, and changes in scores for UE, PI, and QuickDASH were compared, as were the anchor question responses and rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

Results

Sixty-three patients with DCS and 115 patients with CTS only were included. At 3- to 4-month follow-up, absolute and change in UE, PI, and QuickDASH scores were not statistically different between patients with DCS and CTS. Rates of anchor question response and MCID achievement were comparable for patients with CTS only and DCS on each questionnaire. The MCID achievement ranged from 48.4% to 68.8% in the unmatched cohort and 48.4% to 60% in the matched group.

Conclusions

At 3 to 4 months, patients with DCS experience similar patient-reported symptomatic and functional improvement, and achieve MCID of outcome measures at comparable rates to patients with CTS only. For patients with nerve compression at the carpal tunnel and cervical spine, CTR is a reasonable first step prior to proceeding with cervical spine decompression.

### The value added by electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^111tezJT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 6 (CTS-6)" for carpal tunnel syndrome.

The CTS-6, or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 6, is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients suspected of having Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of CTS, a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm.

The CTS-6 score is calculated based on six items: pain distribution, nocturnal symptoms, weakness or atrophy of the thenar eminence, Tinel's sign, Phalen's sign, and loss of two-point discrimination in the median nerve distribution. Each item is scored as either 0 or 1, with a higher total score indicating a higher likelihood of CTS.

The clinical utility of the CTS-6 is to provide a standardized, objective measure to assist in the diagnosis of CTS, which can be particularly useful in early or borderline cases. It can also be used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the CTS-6 include patients with other conditions that can mimic CTS, such as cervical radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or other types of peripheral nerve entrapment. Additionally, it may not be as accurate in patients with severe CTS,

The CTS-6 calculator is a tool designed to gauge the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome based on inputs related to symptoms and diagnostic tests. Users respond to six questions, and each positive answer contributes to a total score that reflects the possibility of having the condition. Here's how it works:

Each potential symptom or test response is assigned a specific point value:

- Numbness in the median nerve territory (thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers): 3.5 points
- **Prominent nocturnal numbness, often waking from sleep**: 4 points
- **Thenar atrophy or weakness in muscle strength**: 5 points
- A positive Phalen test (wrist flexion worsening median nerve numbness): 5 points
- Loss of 2-point discrimination (difficulty distinguishing two points < 5 mm apart): 4.5 points
- A positive Tinel sign (tingling with tapping over median nerve): 4 points

Users indicate the presence or absence of these clinical indicators. For each "yes" response, the designated score is added up to form a total, which can range from 0 to 26.

Interpretation of the calculated score is straightforward:

- With a total score of 12 or higher, there is a high probability (about 80%) of carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 11.5 suggest a moderate probability, between 25% and 80%.
- Scores of 4.5 or lower indicate a lower probability, around 25%.

The score helps clinicians and patients discuss the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome by consolidating the significance of each symptom and test result into a singular, interpretable metric.

So far, no studies reported on how non-traumatic arm, neck and shoulder complaints are managed after a patient consults his/her GP, nor compared management between different diagnostic groups (such as: shoulder impingement, carpal tunnel syndrome, epicondylitis and non-specific neck-shoulder pain). Therefore, data on management can help to define usual care in these complaints, or may show that there is a large variation in care. This insight may serve as information important for future trials, providing evidence of efficacy of the various treatments used and their cost utility.

Our objectives are: to determine management in patients consulting the GP with a new episode of non-traumatic arm neck and shoulder complaints up to 6 months after the first consultation. To evaluate differences in management between patients with specific diagnoses versus non-specific diagnoses and between specific diagnostic groups.

### Concurrent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain in the upper extremity can affect the treatment and prognosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: redefining a common condition [^111fZHc1]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

One observational studyhad shown that decompressing the median nerve at the tunnel may not necessarily result in resolution of musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain, an indication that these symptoms are clinically distinct from each other. The authors would like to propose that "true CTS" should apply only to those cases in which the median nerve-related symptoms are the main or sole manifestations. However, when musculoskeletal pain and symptoms related to median nerve compression occur together, or the former being more prominent and disabling, the proper term should be mechanical stress syndrome, an inclusive term or situation that requires a different treatment approach and has a different prognosis. We conducted a retrospective study of 80 cases of this common condition that we had evaluated and treated over the past 10 years.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^115BFqpv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. To provide the evidence foundation for this AUC, the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine Unit provided the writing panel and voting panel with the 2016 AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline titled Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline. The Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications typical of patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome in clinical practice, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature to identify the appropriateness of treatments. The 135 patient scenarios and 6 treatments were developed by the writing panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### A correlation between upper extremity compressive neuropathy and nerve compression headache [^113NrmHs]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Compressive neuropathies of the head/neck that trigger headaches and entrapment neuropathies of the extremities have traditionally been perceived as separate clinical entities. Given significant overlap in clinical presentation, treatment, and anatomical abnormality, the authors aimed to elucidate the relationship between nerve compression headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome, and other upper extremity compression neuropathies.

Methods

One hundred thirty-seven patients with nerve compression headaches who underwent surgical nerve deactivation were included. A retrospective chart review was conducted and the prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, and cubital tunnel syndrome was recorded. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and thoracic outlet syndrome who had a history of surgery and/or positive imaging findings in addition to confirmed diagnosis were included. Patients with subjective report of carpal tunnel syndrome/thoracic outlet syndrome/cubital tunnel syndrome were excluded. Prevalence was compared to general population data.

Results

The cumulative prevalence of upper extremity neuropathies in patients undergoing surgery for nerve compression headaches was 16.7 percent. The prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome was 10.2 percent, which is 1.8- to 3.8-fold more common than in the general population. Thoracic outlet syndrome prevalence was 3.6 percent, with no available general population data for comparison. Cubital tunnel syndrome prevalence was comparable between groups.

Conclusions

The degree of overlap between nerve compression syndromes of the head/neck and upper extremity suggests that peripheral nerve surgeons should be aware of this correlation and screen affected patients comprehensively. Similar patient presentation, treatment, and anatomical basis of nerve compression make either amenable to treatment by nerve surgeons, and treatment of both entities should be an integral part of a formal peripheral nerve surgery curriculum.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^117MADkh]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Consider degenerative cervical myelopathy in patients over 50 with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck or limbs, imbalance, numbness, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and/or incontinence
Perform a full neurological assessment as early symptoms are subtle and non-specific
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is essential to detect degenerative changes in the cervical spine and cord compression
Time is Spine: Refer patients with suspected DCM promptly to a specialist for consideration of spinal surgery, as delayed diagnosis can lead to residual symptoms and functional disability

A 54 year old man presents with neck stiffness for about a year. He complains of numbness in his fingers and difficulty buttoning up his shirt, which has not improved following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Of late, he has experienced unsteadiness and has started to use a walking stick after sustaining falls. He sees a neurologist who identifies hyperreflexia in his arms and legs. An MRI scan shows multilevel cervical spondylosis and disc herniation causing cord compression. He is diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy and referred to spinal surgery for operative decompression.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / ASSH clinical practice guideline summary management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^1164X61D]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis — CTS-6 vs Ultrasonography or NCV/EMG: Strong evidence suggests that CTS-6 can be used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome, in lieu of routine use of Ultrasonography, or NCV/EMG. Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Supporting studies reported a positive predictive value of ultrasound and NCV/EMG of 94% and 89% respectively, with negative predictive values of 82% and 80% respectively; ultrasonography showed sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 93% respectively, and CTS-6 correlation with NCV/EMG diagnosis was as high as 0.9. There were ten high and five moderate quality studies supporting these tools, and there was no strong evidence demonstrating clinical superiority between diagnostic tools; the guideline highlights the use of the CTS-6 as a diagnostic tool and/or screening tool, and the utilization of ultrasound or NCV/EMG as diagnostic tests when the positive predictive value when using the CTS-6 is low.

### Management in non-traumatic arm, neck and shoulder complaints: differences between diagnostic groups [^115Huta2]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Differences in management

Differences between the specific and non-specific diagnostic groups, on the distribution of referral to a medical specialist, was mainly due to specific diagnoses of forearm, wrist and hand. This may be for confirmation of the diagnosis, non-conservative treatment or reassuring the patient, but we have no data to verify this hypothesis.

The application of corticosteroid injections, mainly in specific shoulder diagnoses, is according to the practice guideline. However, the effect of the application of corticosteroid injections in epicondylitis, shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome, seems to be mainly restricted to short term relief of symptoms.

For the largest subgroup with 'non-specific diagnoses' in arm, neck, and shoulder, no guidelines are available. That patients with non-specific diagnoses are more frequently referred for physiotherapy than patients with specific diagnoses, seems in line with the distribution of the diagnoses in a cohort study in physiotherapy practice where the majority of the study population were patients with non-specific diagnoses.

### Repetitive strain injury [^1175Hko8]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Repetitive strain injury remains a controversial topic. The term repetitive strain injury includes specific disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography are few. Consequently, the role of such imaging in diagnosis of upper limb disorders remains unclear. In many cases, no specific diagnosis can be established and complaints are labelled as non-specific. Little is known about the effectiveness of treatment options for upper limb disorders. Strong evidence for any intervention is scarce and the effect, if any, is mainly short-term pain relief. Exercise is beneficial for non-specific upper limb disorders. Immobilising hand braces and open carpal tunnel surgery release are beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, and topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections are helpful for lateral epicondylitis. Exercise is probably beneficial for neck pain, as are corticosteroid injections and exercise for shoulder pain. Although upper limb disorders occur frequently in the working population, most trials have not exclusively included a working population or assessed effects on work-related outcomes. Further high-quality trials should aim to include sufficient sample sizes, working populations, and work-related outcomes.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111KCknQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Why is it missed?

Non-specific and subtle early features that overlap with other neurological conditions can delay the diagnosis. Incomplete neurological assessment by professionalswith a poor awareness of the diseasefurther contributes to delay. A retrospective study of medical records of 42 patients in Israel who underwent surgery for DCM noted an average delay of 2.2 years (range 1.7 months to 8.9 years) from initiation of symptoms to diagnosis. On average, 5.2 ± 3.6 consultations were required before a diagnosis was made. Forty three per cent of these patients had symptoms of numbness and pain in hands, and were initially diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome. In our clinical experience, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially when diagnosed bilaterally, is often incorrect and DCM usually accounts for these symptoms.

Conclusion

Patients with NSUEP are most commonly older individuals with typical complaints of numbness, weakness, and limited activity. Hypoesthesia, Hoffmann's sign, muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and Spurling's test are easily manifested. Cervical spondylosis, thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and brachial plexus injury are prevalent in patients with NSUEP. Autoimmune rheumatic diseases should be considered in patients with NSUEP and swelling.

### Work-related carpal tunnel syndrome: diagnosis and treatment guideline [^111ec5eT]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, and its risk of occurrence in the presence of repetitive, forceful angular hand movements, or vibration, is common. It is critical to make the diagnosis based on appropriate clinical history and findings and with corroborating electrodiagnostic studies. Conservative management should be undertaken with the goal of maintaining employment; surgical decompression can be highly effective, particularly if undertaken early on.

### Double crush syndrome [^112g8yCT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Double crush syndrome is a distinct compression at two or more locations along the course of a peripheral nerve that can coexist and synergistically increase symptom intensity. In addition, dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may be the result of persistent pathology at another site along a peripheral nerve. Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construction that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.

### New evidence for common practices in carpal tunnel syndrome [^111Mh7r9]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.
- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes or secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of synovial flexor sheath or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United State are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.

### Exercise interventions for treating work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults [^116hcbJL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Work‐related upper limb disorders, repetitive strain injuries, cumulative trauma disorders, occupational overuse syndromes or work‐related complaints of the arm (including wrist, hand and fingers), neck or shoulder (CANS) are frequently used terms for disorders that develop as a result of repetitive movements, awkward postures and impact of external forces such as when operating vibrating tools (Boocock 2009). Work‐related complaints can be divided into specific conditions with relatively clear diagnostic criteria and pathology, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, or non‐specific conditions, such as tension neck syndrome. Non‐specific conditions are usually defined by the location of complaint, with a pathophysiology that is less clearly defined or relatively unknown (Staal 2007).

In this review, we use CANS as a descriptor for work‐related upper‐limb musculoskeletal complaints. The use of the CANS classification was supported by a multidisciplinary Delphi study that provided a list of 23 specific CANS diagnoses and non‐specific CANS diagnoses (Huisstede 2007). Specific diagnoses include: bursitis of the elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical disc hernia, complex regional pain syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, De Quervain's disease, frozen shoulder, Guyon canal syndrome, instability of the elbow, instability of the shoulder, glenoid labral lesion, lateral epicondylitis, local arthritis of a joint of the upper extremities, medial epicondylitis, Oarsman's wrist, radial tunnel syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, rotator cuff tears, subacromial impingement syndrome/rotator cuff‐related shoulder pain, suprascapular nerve compression, biceps tendon tendinitis and trigger finger (Huisstede 2007). People can also have non‐specific CANS where no specific diagnosis can be made (Armstrong 1993), and where no pathological, neurological or radiological characteristics can be found to support the diagnosis of CANS (Staal 2007). Non‐specific CANS includes non‐specific pain that is not listed as one of the 23 specific CANS diagnoses (Huisstede 2007). Using CANS as a descriptor allows for the grouping of a number of upper‐limb complaints that facilitate comparisons (Huisstede 2007).

### Prevalence of endoscopy-related injuries and their impact on clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CX1hc]. Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopy-related musculoskeletal injuries (ERIs) are commonly reported but their exact prevalence and clinical impact remain obscure. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature aiming to answer these questions.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies evaluating ERIs in gastroenterologists and surgeons. The co-primary outcome was the prevalence of ERIs (i.e. carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, and hand numbness). The second co-primary outcome was the prevalence of endoscopy-related pain syndromes.

Results

12 studies, including 4563 respondents, were included. The majority of respondents were men (n = 3321; 72.8%) and most were right-handed (86.2%). The career prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (pooled from 10 studies) was 5.3% (95%CI 1.5%-8.9%; I² = 97.1%), while the prevalence of de Quervain's tenosynovitis (five studies) was 8.5% (95%CI 0.1%-17.0%). The pooled prevalences of thumb pain, neck pain, and back pain were 25.4%, 23.1%, and 19.7%, respectively, but the prevalence varied according to the type of questionnaire used. Only 341/864 respondents (39.5%) had received prior training in ergonomics, while 623/889 respondents (70.1%) expressed a desire for further training in ergonomics. Overall, there is a moderate risk of bias in the present literature.

Conclusion

ERIs, including carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, and endoscopy-related pain, are very common. These injuries can be severe, requiring surgery, and lead to loss of productivity. Most gastroenterologists report an unmet need for training in the proper ergonomics of endoscopy.

### Management in non-traumatic arm, neck and shoulder complaints: differences between diagnostic groups [^111TZcMR]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Strengths and the limitations of this study

This is the first study to compare the management of different diagnostic groups in non-traumatic arm, neck and shoulder complaints. Some of the diagnostic subgroups are large (e.g. shoulder complaints and epicondylitis) and others are very small, reflecting everyday clinical practice. Therefore, the reported management mainly represents these larger diagnostic subgroups.

In the present study, we used the diagnosis registered at the first consultation. However, in some cases the initial diagnosis may have changed after time; due to difficult differential diagnostics within the limited consultation time or the need for additional diagnostic tests, or true changes, what may affect the therapeutic approach. Because of this, and the fact that the diagnosis was realised in a non-standardised manner, we cannot rule out some misclassification. This may have resulted in less contrast between the specific and non-specific group.

In the present study, 15 out of the 682 participants received two diagnoses of whom 8 participants received two specific diagnoses within the same region, which may indicate difficult differential diagnostics. Besides, seven participants were diagnosed with both impingement syndrome and a specific forearm diagnosis (epicondylitis/tendonitis/carpal tunnel syndrome). We chose to work with the most centrally located diagnosis, here impingement syndrome.

Due to the response time of 8 weeks, in 21% of the patients the data on management at baseline were not restricted to a single consultation.

Another issue was that the follow-up questionnaire referred to the previous 6 months. We accounted for possible overlap of treatment options due to recollection of information by reporting 'management up to 6 months'.

In the small group that is referred to a medical specialist, part of the reported decisions on management may be made on the specialists' own initiative.

A recent development in the Netherlands is that since January 2006, patients no longer need a referral for physiotherapy. This may have implications for the overall treatment in the future.

### Complications and reoperation following surgery for concurrent carpal tunnel and cervical spine compression [^1176nb1U]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) may also have cervical radiculopathy (CR) or vice versa, potentially requiring carpal tunnel release (CTR) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). This study evaluates whether there is an increased risk of complications following CTR or ACDF in patients with concurrent CTS and CR (CTS-CR) compared with those with only CTS or CR.

Methods

A multipayer database was used to identify patients with CTS-CR. From this cohort, patients who underwent CTR and/or ACDF were identified. Patients with CTS-CR undergoing surgery were compared with those undergoing surgery with only CTS or CR. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare matched populations to assess postoperative complications and risk of undergoing both procedures.

Results

A total of 110379 patients with CTS-CR were identified. Carpal tunnel release was performed in 21152 patients (19.2%) with CTS-CR, from which 835 (0.76%) underwent ACDF. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed in 6960 patients (6.31%) with CTS-CR followed by CTR in 1098 patients (0.99%). Patients with CTS-CR were at greater risk of reoperation and complex regional pain syndrome following CTR. In ACDF, patients with CTS-CR were at greater risk of reoperation. Obesity and tobacco use were significant risk factors in patients with CTS-CR who underwent both CTR and ACDF rather than a single surgery.

Conclusions

Examination of more than 100000 patients with CTS-CR found a greater likelihood of reoperation and perioperative complications following surgery than those without concurrent diagnoses. Obesity and smoking increased the risk for patients undergoing both procedures. Patients presenting with CTS-CR are high risk and should be counseled on risk of complication and reoperation and optimized to reduce risk of undergoing both CTR and ACDF.

### Ultrasound findings in less frequent causes of carpal tunnel syndrome [^1178pyJ1]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common etiology of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is idiopathic. However, secondary causes of CTS should be considered when symptoms are unilateral, or electrodiagnostic studies are discrepant with the clinical presentation. Imaging of the carpal tunnel should be performed when secondary causes of CTS are suspected. An ultrasound evaluation of the carpal tunnel can assess for pathologic changes of the median nerve, detect secondary causes of CTS, and aid in surgical planning.

Materials and methods

Participants

Thirty patients who met electrodiagnostic and clinical criteria for carpal tunnel syndrome were recruited through the local print media, advertisements on public notice boards and the neurophysiology clinic at the local hospital. Patients were excluded if electrodiagnostic findings were indicative of peripheral neuropathies other than carpal tunnel syndrome, if another medical condition that affected the upper extremity or neck was present, if a history of previous surgery or significant trauma to the upper limb or neck existed, or if carpal tunnel syndrome was related to pregnancy or diabetes. We identified an additional four patients who met the clinical criteria for carpal tunnel syndrome but had negative electrodiagnostic tests. These patients were not included in the cohort analysis but the results of their skin biopsy are reported separately. An age and gender matched cohort of 26 healthy volunteers without any systemic medical condition or a history of hand, arm or neck symptoms was included. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (reference number 10/H0706/35) and all participants gave informed written consent before participating.

Participants attended a single appointment during which one trained examiner performed electrodiagnostic tests, quantitative sensory testing and a skin biopsy.

Peripheral neuropathy (often defined as weakness of sensory loss in one limb) of the upper extremity is a common clinical musculoskeletal scenario. The most common include carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and cervical radiculopathy. A combination of clinical examination, electrodiagnostic testing, and imaging studies, chiefly MR imaging and ultrasonography, is often needed to identify a specific diagnosis for an individual patient. In many cases, ultrasonography is preferred because of ease of access, the possibility of quick contralateral extremity imaging for comparison, and lower cost profile. MR imaging is preferred for deeper nerve structures and large-field-of-view evaluation.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome [^116JUMUK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated costs of two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States in 1995 alone. Local corticosteroid injection has been used as a non-surgical treatment for CTS many years, but its effectiveness is still debated.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to no treatment or a placebo injection.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search Methods. The searches were 7 June 2020 and 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised trials of adults with CTS that included at least one comparison group of local injection of corticosteroid (LCI) into the wrist and one group that received a placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Our secondary outcomes were 2. functional improvement, 3. improvement in symptoms at greater than three months of follow-up, 4. improvement in neurophysiological parameters, 5. improvement in imaging parameters, 6. requirement for carpal tunnel surgery, 7. improvement in quality of life and 8.

Adverse Events

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 14 trials with 994 participants/hands with CTS. Only nine studies (639 participants/hands) had useable data quantitatively and in general, these studies were at low risk of bias except for one quite high-risk study. The trials were conducted in hospital-based clinics across North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All trials used participant-reported outcome measures for symptoms, function and quality of life. There is probably an improvement in symptoms measured at up to three months of follow-up favouring LCI (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.94 to -0.59; 8 RCTs, 579 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Up to six months this was still evident favouring LCI (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.28; 4 RCTs, 234 participants/hands; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably an improvement in function measured at up to three months favouring LCI (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.38; 7 RCTs, 499 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in median nerve DML at up to three months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.37 ms, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.02; 6 RCTs, 359 participants/hands; very low-certainty evidence). The requirement for surgery probably reduces slightly in the LCI group at one year (risk ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98; 1 RCT, 111 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Quality of life, measured at up to three months of follow-up using the Short-Form 6 Dimensions questionnaire (scale from 0.29 to 1.0; higher is better) probably improved slightly in the LCI group (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 RCT, 111 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events were uncommon (low-certainty evidence). One study reported 2/364 injections resulted in severe pain which resolved over "several weeks" and 1/364 injections caused a "sympathetic reaction" with a cool, pale hand that completely resolved in 20 minutes. One study (111 participants) reported no serious adverse events, but 65% of LCI-injected and 16% of the placebo-injected participants experienced mild-to-moderate pain lasting less than two weeks. About 9% of participants experienced localised swelling lasting less than two weeks. Four studies (229 participants) reported that they experienced no adverse events in their studies. Three studies (220 participants) did not specifically report adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Local corticosteroid injection is effective for the treatment of mild and moderate CTS with benefits lasting up to six months and a reduced need for surgery up to 12 months. Where serious adverse events were reported, they were rare.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117LfBbp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. As a result of median nerve compression, the patient reports pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and digits. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial; anatomic, systemic, and occupational factors have all been implicated. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and physical examination and is confirmed by electrodiagnostic testing. Treatment methods range from observation and splinting, to cortisone injection and splinting, to surgical intervention. Both nonsurgical and surgical management provide symptom relief in most patients. The results of open and endoscopic surgery essentially are equivalent at 3 months; the superiority of one technique over the other has yet to be established.

### Concurrent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain in the upper extremity can affect the treatment and prognosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: redefining a common condition [^115P9pKQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of CTS was based on classic symptoms, namely nocturnal numbness, paresthesias, and burning pain in the median nerve distribution. These symptoms were reproduced or induced by driving a motor vehicle or when performing repetitive activities. The sensation over the thenar eminence and the strength of the flexor pollicis longus muscle were intact. Tinel and Phalen signs were clearly present in 70% of patients.

All patients had electrodiagnostic abnormalities (Table 1) consistent with CTS (distal median nerve motor latency of at least 4.2 ms, normal [N] = < 4.0 ms; distal antidromic sensory latency of at least 3.6 ms, N = < 3.5 ms, measured at the peak of the response at either second or fourth fingers, 13 cm from the wrist). None had abnormal proximal velocities or abnormal ulnar or radial nerve conduction results. Monopolar needle electromyography was performed if there was a question of cervical radiculopathy or brachial plexopathy. All patients underwent clinical peripheral neuromuscular examination performed by RPL prior to electrodiagnostic study. Nerve conduction studies were performed using standard techniques for transcutaneous stimulation and recording with surface electrodes, as previously described. Limb temperature was routinely maintained at 36°C using a heat lamp and monitored with a cutaneous thermocouple. Radiological imaging was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in some patients when necessary.

Median nerve decompression was performed either by open or endoscopic release surgery after failure of 4–6 weeks of conservative therapy including physical therapy, analgesics, and workplace ergonomics. Surgery was performed, without conservative therapy, in some patients when the clinical and electrodiagnostic abnormalities were quite severe. These patients were treated nonsurgically in previous years before surgery was performed. Trigger fingers and De Quervain tenosynovitis encountered in five and four patients, respectively, were treated separately.

Those symptoms that resolved following surgery and those that did not were correlated with the presence or absence of median nerve-related symptoms and musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain, and with the degree or severity of each symptom complex.

The Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (IRB) in Columbia, MD, USA, had determined that the present study does not constitute human subject research and, therefore, does not require IRB oversight and it was deemed unnecessary to obtain written informed consent from patients described in this study.

### Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome with ultrasound: should we go more distal? [^113qnc3Q]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy and occurs when the median nerve (MN) gets compressed at the non-displaceable osteofibrous carpal tunnel. The disease affects up to 5% of the population and is more prevalent in women.CTS can be idiopathic or 'primary', when no underlying cause is identified, occurring mainly because of wrist overuse (repetitive occupational or recreational movements), or 'secondary' to an underlying condition, such as inflammatory joint diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), metabolic diseases (eg, thyroid disorders or diabetes), pregnancy or mechanical compression (eg, cysts or wrist fracture sequelae).

Clinical examination is crucial for diagnosing CTS, but nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and ultrasound (US) can be used for additional validation of the diagnosis, especially if invasive therapies are considered. When measured at the carpal tunnel by US, the MN cross-sectional area (CSA) is increased in CTS patients. There is no consensus on how and where to measure the MN when CTS is suspected. Different levels at the forearm and wrist have been proposed by different authors, with the distal forearm, carpal tunnel inlet (scaphoid/pisiform level) and outlet (trapezium/hook of the hamate level) being the most reported.

In entrapment neuropathies, nerve compression and traction lead to microvascular changes, which alter the biochemical environment of neural connective tissue. Anatomically, the MN gets compressed predominantly at the carpal tunnel inlet or outlet, the latter being the narrowest part of the carpal tunnel. It has been known for decades that the CSA of the MN measured by US is increased in CTS patients at these critical levels or proximal to them (ie, at the distal forearm). More recently, Ng et al demonstrated (using both US and MRI) that the MN is also enlarged after exiting the carpal tunnel. We hypothesise that this 'ultradistal' (UD) level of the MN, as we call it, the place where the MN has already exited the carpal tunnel but has not yet divided into its digital branches (online supplemental figure 1), should be considered when investigating CTS by US.

Our aim is to further test whether the MN is enlarged at the UD level in patients with CTS and also to evaluate the impact of adding the UD level to other more comprehensively studied levels (carpal tunnel inlet and outlet) in the performance of US for diagnosing CTS.

### Outcome of endoscopic carpal tunnel release in patients with chronic nonhand pain compared with those without chronic pain [^114FqJHr]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

This prospective observational study compared the outcomes of single-port endoscopic carpal tunnel release in patients taking narcotic pain medication chronically for back, neck, leg, or other bodily pain for more than 3 months, with patients not taking chronic narcotic pain medication (control group).

Methods

Patients undergoing endoscopic carpal tunnel release completed the Levine-Katz carpal tunnel questionnaire (primary outcome) and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire preoperatively, at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks, and at 1 year after surgery. We measured subjective satisfaction with surgery at each postoperative time point as well.

Results

There were 14 patients in the chronic narcotic pain group and 68 in the control group. Both groups showed significant improvement in the Levine-Katz symptom and functional scores and in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (compared with preoperative) at nearly all times. The control group showed better scores at the early time points, but by 6 weeks, there was no difference between groups. Patient satisfaction was excellent in both groups.

Conclusions

Patients who had carpal tunnel syndrome and who were receiving narcotic pain medication chronically for nonhand pain benefited from endoscopic carpal tunnel release. These patients experienced a longer recovery period but ultimately achieved the same outcomes as patients without chronic pain, as measured by the Levine-Katz scores and the DASH score.

3 Results

3.1 Participants

We excluded two patients in the CTS group who had only clinical symptoms of CTS but negative nerve conduction study results. We also excluded one participant in the control group who had a history of wrist trauma. There were no CTS patients with polyneuropathy or cervical radiculopathy in this study. Therefore, the final study cohort comprised 95 patients in the CTS group and 26 healthy volunteers in the control group. Table 1 presents the clinical characteristics of the study cohort. There were no patients classified as "mild" in our cohort. There were significant differences in BMI between the control and moderate groups (p = 0.04), as well as between the control and severe groups (p = 0.01).

### Local corticosteroid injection versus surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115b34S3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated costs of two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States alone. Local corticosteroid injection has been used as a non-surgical treatment for CTS for many years, but its effectiveness is still debated.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) compared to surgery.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. The latest search was 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised trials of adults with CTS that included at least one comparison group of local corticosteroid injection (LCI) into the wrist and one group of any surgical intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Our secondary outcomes were 2. functional improvement, 3. improvement in symptoms at greater than three months of follow-up, 4. improvement in neurophysiological parameters, 5. improvement in imaging parameters, 6. improvement in quality of life and 7.

Adverse Events

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included seven studies involving 569 'hands' (although two studies had unusable data for quantitative analyses). All studies used a one-time LCI as a comparator, using several different types and doses of corticosteroids. In every study, for both surgery and LCI groups, all our primary and secondary outcomes showed improvement from pre- to post-treatment. However, evidence from the combined analysis was too uncertain for us to draw reliable conclusions for the comparison of surgical treatment versus LCI with respect to our primary outcome of symptom relief at up to three months' follow-up (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61 to 1.88; I² = 95%; 5 trials, 305 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Findings with respect to secondary outcome measures of symptom relief at greater than three months' follow-up (SMD 0.94, 95% CI -0.31 to 2.19; I² = 93%; 4 trials, 235 participants), functional improvement at up to three months' follow-up (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.72; I² = 84%; 3 trials, 215 participants) and functional improvement at greater than three months' follow-up (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -1.22 to 1.59; I² = 93%; 3 trials, 185 participants) were also uncertain (very low-certainty evidence) and showed no clear advantage for surgery or LCI. Surgery may improve neurophysiology (median nerve distal motor latency) more than LCI (mean difference (MD) 0.87 ms, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.42; I² = 72%; 3 trials, 162 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence for quality of life and adverse events was also uncertain; quality of life (EuroQol-5D-3L) may be slightly improved after LCI than after surgery (the difference may not be clinically important) (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12; 1 trial, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and there may be fewer adverse events with LCI than with surgery (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.26; 3 trials, 112 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence comparing LCI to surgery for CTS, either in the short term or up to 12 months' follow-up, is too uncertain for any reliable conclusions to be drawn.

### Concurrent musculoskeletal and soft tissue pain in the upper extremity can affect the treatment and prognosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: redefining a common condition [^11358iXQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

One of the authors (RPL), a board-certified neurologist and electroneuromyographer, had received referrals from various surgical specialists for electrodiagnostic study (using Cadwell Sierra 11 Wedge EMG NCV System), including referrals from the co-author (TSE), a board-certified orthopedic and hand surgeon who performed carpal tunnel release surgery on 20 of 80 patients studied, and from other orthopedic and plastic surgeons who performed surgery in the remaining 60 patients. The study period extended from 2007 to 2017.

Various cases of work-related sensory symptoms in the upper extremity, particularly in the wrist, were included in the study: patients were engaged in various occupations that require repetitive hand motion. Some cases included in the study with classic signs of CTS had no clear identifiable risk factors. Patients with diabetes without overt signs of poly-neuropathy including those with hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and those with previous history of wrist fractures were also included. These conditions were included because the presenting and disabling symptoms were referable to the upper extremities, particularly in the hands. Those with clear signs and symptoms of cervical radiculopathy due to herniated discs and/or significant degenerative changes in the cervical spine, brachial plexopathy, concurrent mono-neuropathies, active arthropathies in the elbow and shoulder, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, malignancy, musculoskeletal pain related to vehicular accidents, peripheral neuromuscular and central nervous system disorders, and thoracic outlet syndrome were excluded from the study. We felt it was necessary to exclude these conditions since the prominent and predominant symptoms in these patients were related to the primary conditions and not to the CTS. Those with persistent signs of median nerve dysfunction following surgery and considered as treatment failure, along with those who developed postoperative infection, were also excluded. A total of 80 cases, 60 unilateral and 20 bilateral, were studied and were followed for 6 months to 2 years, postoperatively.

### A survey of musculoskeletal disorders in the orthopaedic surgeon: identifying injuries, exacerbating workplace factors, and treatment patterns in the orthopaedic community [^1158fKaR]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 3% of respondents pursued surgical treatment across all conditions, with highest rates of operation for lumbar radiculopathy and carpal tunnel. Respondents with lumbar radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome diagnoses had the greatest rates of surgical treatment; for each of these conditions, 6% of survey respondents in each group pursued surgical treatment. Farjado et alreported an incidence in the United States of one to three cases of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) per 1,000 patients (0.1% to 0.4%), with an incidence of carpal tunnel release (CTR) of 2/1,000 in men and 4/1,000 in women, indicating that this series of orthopaedic surgeons demonstrated an increased rate of CTS diagnosis and surgical treatment compared with the general population. Because multiple causes of lumbar radiculopathy exist, and thus various surgical treatment options are used based on individual diagnoses, a reliable comparison of specific surgical treatments for this condition could not be performed based on existing survey results of this population. Surgeons were most likely to require leaves of absence because of rotator cuff tendinitis (n = 10) and carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 10).

Patients and methods

During the first 6 months of 2017 from January to June, 112 patients referred to the Electrodiagnosis Unit of Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital with complaints related to one of the main symptoms of CTS were consecutively recruited. Sampling continued until 80 electrodiagnostically confirmed CTS cases of mild or moderate stages were included. A written informed consent was obtained from all the eligible patients in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Then, they were assigned to four groups of 20 members each using block randomization method (block size = 4 members): 20 mg triamcinolone (T20), 40 mg triamcinolone (T40), 20 mg methylprednisolone (M20), and 40 mg methylprednisolone (M40).

All the included patients were symptomatic, as they had at least one of the major symptoms of CTS (pain, numbness, paresthesia in the palm or fingers, and subjective weakness in grip). The symptoms should have been lasting for 3–12 months and not been relieved by other conservative treatments such as night splinting and physical agent modalities such as laser therapy, ultrasonography (US), and manual therapy. The exclusion criteria were severe stage of CTS; current pregnancy; any history of diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroid disorders; previous history of relevant surgery or hand trauma; any local injection in wrist within the last 6 months; thenar atrophy in physical examination; and active cervical radiculopathy or other peripheral neuropathies in the upper extremity.

Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of rare lysosomal storage diseases with multisystem manifestations, including carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This study comprised a systematic review of literature and hospital guidelines addressing the method and frequency of screening for carpal tunnel syndrome in mucopolysaccharidosis patients and a review of carpal tunnel syndrome in patients seen in the multidisciplinary mucopolysaccharidosis clinic of a pediatric hospital, in order to develop screening recommendations. The literature reported the importance of routine carpal tunnel syndrome screening from early childhood in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, IV, and VI. Screening methods included physical examination, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and ultrasonography. Ten of 20 mucopolysaccharidosis patients in our series underwent carpal tunnel syndrome surgery. Given the high incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome at a young age in mucopolysaccharidosis, the authors recommend performing physical examination and obtaining patient and caregiver history for carpal tunnel syndrome every 6 months from the time of mucopolysaccharidosis diagnosis, supplemented by annual nerve conduction studies in cases with poor history or equivocal examination.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^1158i9hu]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — diagnostic accuracy of provocative clinical tests relative to electromyography (EMG) is reported from a Level IV comparative diagnostic study including Number of patients: 82; consecutive patients were referred for EMG for cervical radiculopathy (CR) or carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). A standardized clinical exam was performed by two of nine physical therapists and contained 34 items, the history contained six questions, and provocative tests included Spurling's test, shoulder abduction test, Valsalva maneuver, neck distraction test and the upper limb tension test. Fifteen patients had an EMG diagnosis of CR, five had CR with concomitant ulnar neuropathy and CTS, and one patient with combined findings dropped out; of the 19 patients reported, 13 had mild symptoms and six had moderate symptoms. Conclusions state that these provocative tests have a low sensitivity and high specificity for cervical radiculopathy as diagnosed by EMG, are not useful as a screening test but may be useful to confirm the diagnosis, and the work group conclusions classify the evidence as Potential level: III with Downgraded level: IV.

### False-positive rates for nerve conduction studies and ultrasound in patients without clinical signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome [^115ysHE5]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of the study was to determine the rate of false positives for nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and ultrasound (US) in a population without signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using a CTS-6 score of 0 as the reference standard.

Methods

Patients were included in this study if they were referred for NCSs for a reason other than CTS (cubital tunnel syndrome and/or cervical radiculopathy) and they had a CTS-6 score of 0. An US measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel inlet was performed by a certified ultrasound technician. An a priori CSA cutoff of 10 mm² or greater measured using US at the carpal tunnel inlet qualified as a positive diagnosis. The NCSs were performed and interpreted according to national standards by a certified electrodiagnostician. All patients in this study were considered to not have a diagnosis of CTS based on the CTS-6 of 0.

Results

Forty hands with a CTS-6 of 0 were included in this study. The US was positive in 9 of 40(23%) and NCS was positive in 17 of 40 (43%). There were only 2 patients with a false-positive US that did not also have a positive NCS. However, there were 11 patients who had a false-positive NCS that did not have a positive US.

Conclusions

This prospective cohort series has demonstrated that US has a lower false-positive rate than NCSs in asymptomatic patients as measured by the CTS-6 diagnostic tool. Studies with a low false-positive rate are preferred when ordering a confirmatory diagnostic test. Therefore, if a confirmatory diagnostic test is desired, we recommend that US be used rather than NCSs.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — osteoarthritis and prior musculoskeletal disorders: One theory for how osteoarthritis (OA) may predispose people to CTS is that hypertrophy of carpal bones narrows the tunnel and thereby produces compression of the median nerve, while the reason for previous musculoskeletal disorders leading to CTS is less clear. Werner et al suggests (1) that individuals with pain in other parts of the upper extremity may develop compensatory strategies that place higher loads and awkward positioning of the hand and wrist or (2) because CTS can refer pain to the elbow or shoulder, patients with CTS may be misdiagnosed as having various tendinopathies.

Diagnoses

Among the 444 patients with NSUEP, 106 (23.9%) were diagnosed with cervical spondylosis, 67 (15.1%) with cervical radiculopathy, and 66 (14.9%) with thoracic outlet syndrome. Among the 352 patients with a single diagnosis, spinal surgical, hand surgical, and neurological diseases accounted for a relatively high proportion (Figure 6). Fifty-one patients (14.5%) presented with thoracic outlet syndrome, 49 (13.9%) with cervical radiculopathy, 16 (4.5%) with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 16 (4.5%) with brachial plexus injury. The remaining 92 patients received a compound diagnosis: 18 (19.6%) diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy (Table 3) and 15 (16.3%) with thoracic outlet syndrome.

Among the 106 patients with cervical spondylosis, 67 (63.2%) were diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy, 22 (20.8%) diagnosed with cervical myelopathy, and 1 (0.9%) diagnosed with mixed cervical spondylosis and sympathetic cervical spondylosis. Additionally, 15 (14.2%) patients with cervical spondylosis experienced muscle weakness and atrophy without hypoesthesia (Figure 7).

Treatments

Of the 444 patients with NSUEP, 170 (38.3%) were recommended for conservative therapy. A total of 164 cases (36.9%) were recommended for surgical treatment, including 84 requiring hand surgery, 74 requiring spine surgery, 6 requiring neurosurgery, and 1 requiring vascular surgery. In addition, scalene block injection was recommended in 10 cases. Ninety-nine patients (22.3%) were recommended for medical treatment, including 24 for neurology treatments and 21 for rheumatology treatments. Moreover, 11 patients (2.5%) required combined treatment from multiple departments.

### Ulnar tunnel syndrome [^115bzJRw]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at or distal to the wrist, the so-called ulnar tunnel syndrome, is an uncommon but well-described condition. However, diagnosis of ulnar tunnel syndrome can be difficult. Paresthesias may be nonspecific or related to coexisting pathologies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8-T1 radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy, which makes accurate diagnosis challenging. The advances in electrodiagnosis, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have improved the diagnostic accuracy. This article offers an updated view of ulnar tunnel syndrome as well as its etiologies, diagnoses, and treatments.

### Biomechanical risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome: a pooled study of 2474 workers [^115ymfRP]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Of the initial 3214 workers, 364 were excluded due to CTS (N = 309) or possible polyneuropathy (N = 55) at enrolment. Of the remaining 2850 eligible workers, 376 were dropped due to lack of exposure data or loss to follow-up for a participation rate of 86.8% (figure 1). There were 179 (7.2%) incident CTS cases occurring over 5103 years of follow-up, for an incident rate of 3.51 per 100 person-years (table 1). The mean age at baseline was 40.8 years (SD = 11.1) and 88% had no reported medical condition. The median years worked at the same company at baseline was 6.1 years (IQR 2.3–12) and most participants (84%) worked the day shift. The median follow-up time was 2 years (IQR = 1–2.9) with 10% of participants having less than 6 months of follow-up time and 10% having more than 4.7 years.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome in children with mucopolysaccaridoses [^112KeTWQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome in children is uncommon. Mucopolysaccharidosis is the most common cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in this age group. With new treatment modalities available for mucopolysaccaridoses, the prognosis of the disease has greatly improved. The musculoskeletal manifestations including carpal tunnel syndrome now assume more importance. Early diagnosis and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in these children are important to achieve a good outcome. The authors present their experience in the management of children with mucopolysaccharidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

Clinical Features The classic symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are pain, numbness, and tingling in the distribution of the median nerve, although numbness in all fingers may be a more common presentation. 4 Symptoms are usually worse at night and can awaken patients from sleep. To relieve the symptoms, patients often "flick"their wrist as if shaking down a thermometer. In patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, pain and paresthesias may radiate to the forearm, elbow, and shoulder. Decreased grip strength may result in loss of dexterity, and thenar muscle atrophy may develop if the syndrome is severe. Although one hand typically has more severe symptoms, both hands often are affected. LOCAL INJECTION Combined injection of a corticosteroid and a local anesthetic into or proximal to the carpal tunnel can be used in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Such injections can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic.

While most studies evaluating local injection have been retrospective or uncontrolled, two recent systematic reviews of RCTs concluded that local corticosteroid injection provides greater clinical improvement at one month compared with placebo. Direct injection into the carpal tunnel by either method carries the potential for needle injury to the median nerve, intratendinous injection and tendon rupture, or dysesthesias that may persist for months. 26 An alternative approach is to place the injection proximal to the carpal tunnel, rather than directly in it. This approach lowers the risk of damage to the median nerve and theoretically treats concomitant swelling at the volar side of the forearm. With any method, injection of corticosteroid into the median nerve must be avoided.

SURGERY Carpal tunnel release surgery should be considered in patients with symptoms that do not respond to conservative measures and in patients with severe nerve entrapment as evidenced by nerve conduction studies, thenar atrophy, or motor weakness. It is important to note that surgery may be effective even if a patient has normal nerve conduction studies. Complications of surgery include injury to the palmar cutaneous or recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, hypertrophic scarring, laceration of the superficial palmar arch, and tendon adhesion. 25 Postoperative infection, hematoma, arterial injury, stiffness, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy are other possible complications. 21 If carpal tunnel release is incomplete, symptoms may recur.
