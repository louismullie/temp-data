## Question

Why orderCEA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and why to order CEA in colorectal cancer care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where CEA is appropriate. Then, I should verify the prognostic value of preoperative CEA. Next, I will examine the role of postoperative CEA in surveillance and how to interpret trends. After that, I need to check the evidence for CEA in metastatic disease monitoring. I should also review false positives and negatives, thresholds, and when to escalate to imaging. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, alternatives like ctDNA, and synthesize a practical decision framework with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which ordering CEA is appropriate, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending its use beyond evidence-based indications. CEA is recommended in four principal settings: preoperative baseline assessment, postoperative surveillance after curative-intent resection, monitoring response in metastatic disease, and as part of the workup for rising CEA during follow-up, with guideline support from ASCRS, NCCN, and ESMO, and with ASCO historical guidance informing surveillance cadence and scope [^117PSNNw] [^111ssa1N] [^112wmntG] [^111KJDVm].

> Now, I should verify the prognostic value of preoperative CEA, because that often drives baseline ordering. Preoperative CEA is an independent predictor of overall survival in stage I–III colon cancer, with elevated values associated with substantially higher hazard of death, and it establishes a reference for postoperative surveillance; ASCRS gives this a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, and SEER coding reinforces CEA as a pretreatment prognostic factor [^117PSNNw] [^112tLbcp]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk; yes, a large multivariable analysis cited by ASCRS shows about a 62% increase in hazard with elevated preoperative CEA, though the optimal cutoff remains uncertain, which is why I should be cautious about hard thresholds here [^117PSNNw].

> Next, I will examine the role of postoperative CEA in surveillance, and I need to ensure I get the timing and cadence right. NCCN recommends CEA every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for a total of 5 years for stage II–III disease, and ASCO-endorsed guidance similarly supports every 3–6 months for 5 years, with intensity tailored to risk and fitness for curative therapy. Importantly, routine CEA beyond 5 years is not recommended [^112B8mCB] [^117VXjvi] [^116qsKtx]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale. Surveillance aims to detect recurrence earlier when curative-intent resection is feasible, and CEA contributes to that goal when combined with imaging and endoscopy, though it should not be used in isolation [^114S5PGC].

> I will now examine how to interpret CEA trends and thresholds, because misinterpretation leads to overtesting or missed recurrences. A rising CEA, especially above 10 ng/mL, warrants prompt imaging workup, but I should double-check the false-positive profile; approximately half of elevations are false positives, mostly in the 5–15 ng/mL range, whereas levels above 35 ng/mL are almost always true positives, and pooled sensitivity/specificity at a 10 ng/mL cutoff are about 68% and 97%, respectively [^111ssa1N] [^1169KMiD]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic accuracy data; a JAMA review corroborates sensitivity around 68–82% and specificity 80–97% depending on the threshold, reinforcing that lower cutoffs increase sensitivity at the cost of more false alarms, which argues for trend-based interpretation and confirmatory imaging rather than reflexive action on a single modest elevation [^115y5T1x].

> Let me consider the evidence for CEA in metastatic disease monitoring, and I should confirm whether kinetics matter. In metastatic colorectal cancer, serial CEA is useful to track treatment response, and a CEA flare phenomenon early in effective chemotherapy correlates with improved outcomes compared with rising CEA, which should temper premature concern if a transient rise follows initiation of therapy; ESMO also supports CEA monitoring during active treatment of metastatic disease [^114QjBbf] [^112wmntG]. I need to ensure I don't overstate precision; CEA correlates with disease burden but is not a substitute for imaging, so I should integrate CEA with radiologic response assessment rather than rely on it alone [^112wmntG].

> Next, I should review the workup for rising CEA after resection, because this is where clinical judgment prevents both under- and over-investigation. For a confirmed rising CEA, guidelines recommend colonoscopy, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast, physical examination, and consideration of PET/CT if CT is negative but CEA continues to rise; importantly, blind CEA-directed surgery is not recommended when imaging is negative, and repeat CT at 3-month intervals is reasonable if CEA remains elevated without a source identified [^1169KMiD] [^115GPXwr] [^116qBfgJ]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PET/CT; NCCN notes divided panel opinion but acknowledges pooled sensitivity/specificity around 94%/77% in this setting, so PET/CT can be considered selectively when conventional imaging is unrevealing and CEA rises persistently [^116gSEUt].

> I should confirm how to handle false positives and negatives, because these drive inappropriate imaging and missed recurrences. False positives are common in the 5–15 ng/mL range and often reflect smoking, inflammation, or liver disease, so confirming a trend and correlating with clinical context is essential; conversely, a normal CEA does not exclude recurrence, with likelihood ratios showing that a negative CEA reduces but does not eliminate post-test probability of recurrence, which is why CEA must be paired with imaging and endoscopy in surveillance [^113VCGLX] [^115rQExd]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied CEA could rule out recurrence; that would be incorrect, and the data clearly show residual risk even with normal CEA, reinforcing multimodality surveillance rather than CEA-only strategies [^115rQExd].

> Let me think about special scenarios where CEA adds particular value, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. In rectal cancer, preoperative CEA is part of standard evaluation and helps prognostication and surveillance planning; in small bowel adenocarcinoma, CEA and CA 19–9 are included in initial workup; in medullary thyroid carcinoma, CEA is used alongside calcitonin to monitor disease and guide imaging; and in suspected mucinous ovarian tumors, CEA and CA 19–9 help distinguish metastatic GI primaries from primary ovarian mucinous neoplasms, which can alter surgical management [^113owKnE] [^113SbD7g] [^111C8Tir] [^116fLvbd]. Hold on, I should verify that these are guideline-supported rather than anecdotal; yes, NCCN and specialty society guidelines endorse these uses in the appropriate clinical contexts [^113SbD7g] [^116fLvbd] [^111C8Tir].

> But wait, what if CEA is normal preoperatively; does that negate its utility in surveillance? I should confirm that even within normal ranges, higher preoperative CEA portends worse outcomes, and that postoperative CEA dynamics remain informative. Studies show that high-normal preoperative CEA is independently associated with inferior disease-free survival, and that postoperative CEA elevation, not preoperative elevation per se, is the critical adverse prognostic signal; thus, establishing an individual baseline still matters for interpreting serial changes during follow-up [^112tyUE5] [^116HVHg2]. I need to ensure I communicate that normalization of an initially elevated CEA after resection is reassuring, whereas failure to normalize or a subsequent rise warrants intensified evaluation [^116HVHg2].

> Next, I should review alternatives and adjuncts to CEA, especially ctDNA, and I must be careful not to jump to conclusions based on early enthusiasm. Multiple cohort studies suggest ctDNA assays do not clearly outperform standard imaging plus CEA in detecting recurrence and may miss low-burden pulmonary disease, with combined imaging and CEA often detecting recurrence earlier than ctDNA; until prospective data show improved survival from ctDNA-driven interventions, CEA plus CT per NCCN remains the evidence-based standard, and routine PET/CT for surveillance remains discouraged outside trials [^114L3Zrs] [^116ngyqB] [^112Ff98i] [^113qbsiF]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions; NCCN and ESMO do not currently recommend ctDNA for routine surveillance, aligning with a conservative, cost-conscious approach pending stronger outcome data [^112B8mCB] [^112wmntG].

> I should double-check the practical decision framework to ensure it aligns with guidelines and the evidence summarized above. Order CEA preoperatively to establish a baseline and for prognostication, then continue postoperative surveillance every 3–6 months for 2 years and every 6 months for years 3–5 in stage II–III patients who are candidates for curative therapy, escalating evaluation for rising CEA with colonoscopy, CT, and selective PET/CT if CT is negative; avoid CEA for screening, interpret modest single elevations cautiously, and integrate CEA with imaging and endoscopy rather than relying on it in isolation [^112B8mCB] [^1169KMiD] [^116gSEUt] [^114S5PGC]. Let me reconsider whether any step contradicts high-quality evidence; no, this approach matches NCCN, ASCRS, and ESMO guidance and reflects the balance of sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility seen in randomized and observational data [^111ssa1N] [^117PSNNw] [^112wmntG].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit and evidence-based. CEA is most valuable as a baseline prognostic marker, a surveillance adjunct that can detect recurrence months before symptoms, and a treatment-response biomarker in metastatic disease; it is not a screening test, not a stand-alone diagnostic, and not a substitute for imaging or endoscopy, and its best use is within guideline-concordant, multimodality surveillance programs that match intensity to patient risk and fitness for curative interventions [^117PSNNw] [^111ssa1N] [^112wmntG] [^115y5T1x].

---

CEA is ordered to **monitor treatment response and detect recurrence** in colorectal cancer [^114ZaXS5], as it is the standard marker for postoperative surveillance and for tracking metastatic disease [^111ssa1N] [^112wmntG]. It is also used to establish a **baseline before surgery** for prognosis and to guide follow-up [^117PSNNw]. CEA is not recommended for screening or diagnosis because of false positives and low sensitivity [^113VCGLX] [^112DSYT7]; it should be interpreted with imaging and clinical context [^1169KMiD].

---

## Clinical indications for ordering CEA

### Preoperative assessment

For preoperative assessment, **baseline CEA** should be obtained before elective surgery for colon or rectal cancer to establish a reference for surveillance and because preoperative CEA is prognostic for recurrence and survival [^117PSNNw] [^113owKnE]. For **prognostic value**, elevated preoperative CEA independently predicts worse survival and is associated with higher recurrence risk [^117PSNNw] [^116HVHg2].

---

### Postoperative surveillance

For postoperative surveillance, **routine monitoring** with CEA every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 5 years, is recommended for stage II–III colorectal cancer to detect recurrence early [^111ssa1N] [^111TCduw]. For **early detection**, rising CEA can identify recurrence months before symptoms, enabling timely intervention [^115y5T1x] [^117Pizhn].

---

### Monitoring treatment response in metastatic disease

For monitoring treatment response in metastatic disease, **response assessment** uses serial CEA measurements to evaluate systemic therapy; decreases in CEA correlate with improved survival [^117PSNNw] [^112wmntG]. For **CEA flare**, a transient rise after chemotherapy initiation can indicate effective treatment and should not prompt premature changes [^114QjBbf].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives**: CEA can be elevated in smokers, liver disease, pancreatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, reducing specificity [^114H3K6y] [^113VCGLX].

- **False negatives**: Some tumors do not produce CEA, so normal levels do not exclude recurrence [^116ZKwC6] [^115rQExd].

- **Not for screening**: CEA is not recommended for colorectal cancer screening due to low sensitivity and specificity [^114H3K6y] [^112DSYT7].

- **Imaging correlation**: Always interpret CEA with imaging and clinical findings to avoid misdiagnosis [^1169KMiD] [^117QTsA7].

## Clinical utility of CEA

| **Clinical scenario** | **Role of cea** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Preoperative assessment | Baseline and prognosis | Once before surgery |
| Postoperative surveillance | Detect recurrence | Every 3–6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 5 years |
| Metastatic disease monitoring | Treatment response | Every 1–3 months during active treatment |
| Rising CEA | Investigate recurrence | Immediate imaging and clinical evaluation |

---

CEA is ordered to **guide prognosis, surveillance, and treatment monitoring** in colorectal cancer; it is most useful when interpreted in conjunction with imaging and clinical assessment [^111ssa1N] [^1169KMiD].

## References

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^113raZpY]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A surprising feature of all the above examples of targeted tumour delivery is that the choice of biomarker used is rarely justified in terms of its tumour sensitivity and specificity. The characteristics of suitable cancer biomarkers are that they must be highly expressed in a large majority of tumours and have low or no expression in normal tissue, encompassing the normal tissue from which the tumour is derived and – ideally – most or all normal adult tissues accessible to systemic delivery. Suitable molecules must also be located on the external facing surfaces of cancer cells so as to be accessible to systemically delivered recognition molecules. To our knowledge, expression of the most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer has never been rigorously evaluated in a well-defined cohort of cancer and normal tissue. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the four most commonly used markers for colorectal cancer, CEA, TAG-72, FR α, and EGFR, to define which is most suitable for in vivo tumour targeting.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^1146zTkv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a highly glycosylated antigen of 201 kDa, which is expressed on the apical surface of colon epithelial cells and excreted through the intestinal cavity. With the destruction of normal tissue structure in malignant tumors and the loss of polarization of neoplastic cells in the depth of tumor glandular tissue, CEA may be expressed on the entire cell surface and may eventually enter the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in its serum level. The serum level of CEA is a significant tumor marker used to aid in the management of CRC, notably in the preoperative and postoperative assessment of the patients. A higher preoperative CEA level has been identified as an independent and practical predictor of both overall and disease-free survival of CRC. Periodic measurement of CEA levels is important as it could not only reflect the remaining disease when measured postoperatively but also predict cancer recurrence when measured during the surveillance period. A recent study was performed to assess the positive role of CEA in the management of CRC. The data indicated that the 5-year OS and DFS rates for patients with CEA levels ≥ 2.5 ng/ml were 73% and 79% respectively, which were lower than those with CEA level < 2.5 ng/ml (85% and 86% respectively). Recent study has shown that CEA also has a great role in predicting metastatic CRC (mCRC). In mCRC patients with baseline CEA ≥ 10 ng/ml, CEA levels can predict disease progression after first-line induction therapy in mCRC patients with baseline CEA ≥ 10 ng/ml. A prospective study has noted that CEA kinetic measurements are clinically relevant to the early prediction of treatment outcome in patients with mCRC. When CEA is combined with CA19–9 and CA72–4 to form a joint prediction model, it is more effective in diagnosing and predicting prognosis of CRC patients. Under the circumstances of COVID-19, We believe that it is inconvenient for the elderly to go to the hospital for regular check-ups, especially for some CT and MRI examinations. In this circumstance, by using a liquid biopsy of tumor marker CEA, the prognosis of the elderly can be briefly estimated according to the CEA level. Obviously, as a classical tumor marker, we should spare no effort to explore more value of CEA in clinical diagnosis and treatment, and provide guidance and reference for various CRC patients.

### Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and sarcoidosis masquerading as metastatic colon cancer [^113R8xuK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

When patients with colorectal cancer are monitored after resection of primary or metastatic disease, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is usually an indicator of recurrent disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often used to locate the site of recurrences when computed tomography scans do not show the presence of disease. This case highlights an important cause of a falsely elevated CEA with abnormal PET imaging.

### Use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers: surgeon perceptions and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^111zUtvp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal cancers are the third most common cancers worldwide, with a prevalence of 1,281,539 in the US in 2013. Survival for gastrointestinal malignancies have been improving worldwide due to advances in multimodality treatments, diagnostic strategies and expanding the criteria for treatable disease. While these strategies commonly involve a combination of radiological and endoscopic techniques, some studies have shown serum tumor markers may have a diagnostic, as well as therapeutic, monitoring role.

A tumor marker is defined as a compound produced by the tumor or the host, in response to a malignancy. Traditionally, markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and, to a lesser extent, cancer antigen (CA) 19–9, have been used clinically to monitor disease response, whereby the efficacy of treatments can be assessed by noting a reduction in the level of a marker, which was previously high. In colorectal cancer, the use of tumor makers in postoperative surveillance has been recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology; however, their use in the identification of metastasis and diagnostic accuracy has not been establisheddespite some clinicians incorporating them into regular practice. In contrast, the use of tumor markers in esophagogastric malignancies in any capacity remains controversial. A number of studies have assessed the use of several tumor markers in prognosis and diagnosis, however they are of limited quality. As such, there is no clear consensus on the use of tumor markers, and current practice is dependent on the individual clinician's choice.

In both cancer types, there is hence a clear need for an objective evaluation of common tumor markers in several clinical scenarios. This appraisal requires a comparison of clinical utility and costs or negatives with the utilization of the marker; however the relative importance of these benefits and costs, or performance characteristics, as drivers to uptake has not yet been quantified by the literature and would be dependent on how clinicians perceive the use of tumor markers. This study aimed to critically assess the cost-benefit trade-off of three common tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancers by means of evaluating the perceptions of surgeons to common markers.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^111ePnuE]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to compare the sensitivity of a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified ctDNA assay for minimal residual disease (Signatera) with standard radiographic imaging and measurement of CEA levels in identifying early disease recurrence in patients with curatively resected stage I to IV colorectal cancer. This retrospective study was approved by and conducted under the institutional review board of the City of Hope National Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, which did not require informed consent for this retrospective outcome study. This study was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

All patients with colorectal cancer undergoing surveillance with the Signatera ctDNA assay during a 2-year period (September 1, 2019, to November 30, 2021) were identified. Patients were separated into groups with resected stage II to III disease and resected stage IV disease. All patients undergoing minimal residual disease surveillance had undergone definitive surgical treatment and completed adjuvant therapy, if indicated. Patients followed a standard surveillance strategy that included ctDNA every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years. Measurement of CEA levels was performed at the same interval as the ctDNA assay. Imaging studies were performed within NCCN guidelines and included yearly CT scans for 5 years for low-risk stage II disease and every 6 months for 2 years and then every year for 3 years for high-risk stage II and III disease. Imaging studies were performed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years for resected stage IV disease.

### Tumor marker ordering: Do not lose control: a prospective clinical trial [^115obbW4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we evaluated the extent of inappropriate tumor marker (TM) ordering in a secondary care setting, approximately 6 years after the introduction of local guidelines, and we identified the main factors potentially influencing clinicians when performing an inappropriate TM request.

Methods

For this purpose, we regularly checked all requests containing more than two TMs. During the 21-month audit, the rate of rejected requests amounted to 3.6%. Several of those were performed for diagnostic purposes. The most frequent and inappropriately requested TMs were carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19.9.

Results

The inappropriateness of requests appeared to be linked to the need for more education and knowledge on their clinical applicability and limitations. The clinical motivation was generally associated with patients displaying nonspecific signs/symptoms (ie, weight loss with worsening general conditions), having an incidentally positive result to some recently performed TM tests, or being tested by a TM to avoid more expensive diagnostic imaging procedures.

Conclusions

Our data show that real-time control and management of inappropriate requests by laboratory professionals may be relevant to increase the clinical efficacy of TM testing and useful in perspective to drive the introduction of new validated biomarkers.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^114L3Zrs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) associated with improved sensitivity and earlier detection of recurrence compared with standard imaging and evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in patients with resected colorectal cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study of 48 patients with resected colorectal cancer, 15 had confirmed disease recurrence by imaging, of whom only 8 had a concurrent positive ctDNA finding. The combination of imaging and CEA measurement had better sensitivity compared with ctDNA in identifying disease recurrence (73.3% vs 53.3%).

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay provides no definitive advantage compared with standard imaging and CEA measurement in the surveillance of patients with resected colorectal cancer.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^112B8mCB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Surveillance strategies in the management of resected locoregional and metastatic colorectal cancer have been investigated thoroughly during the last several decades. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and intensive imaging have been investigated as sole or combination strategies in the surveillance of resected stage I to III disease, considerable disagreement remains regarding the impact of these assays on colorectal cancer outcome. Despite the limited benefits of measuring CEA levels and imaging on the overall survival among patients with colorectal cancer, these tests are still believed to have value in the early detection of metastatic disease recurrence, which can lead to curative surgery. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) currently recommends the surveillance of stage II and III colorectal cancer with measurement of CEA levels every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 3 years. In addition, patients with stage II to III colorectal cancer are to undergo computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 2 years followed by yearly imaging for 3 years. For resected stage IV disease, the NCCN recommends a similar CEA surveillance strategy and intensive imaging, with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3 to 6 months for 2 years followed by every 6 to 12 months for another 3 years. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) has largely endorsed a similar surveillance strategy. Neither the NCCN nor the ESMO recommend the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays for surveillance of colorectal cancer.

### Clinical significance of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen within the normal range in colorectal cancer patients undergoing curative resection [^112tyUE5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a widely used tumor marker in colorectal cancer (CRC), but within normal range of preoperative CEA levels the clinical significance of CEA is unknown.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of CEA within the normal range as a prognosticator of non-metastatic CRC.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 2021 CRC patients with normal preoperative CEA who underwent elective curative surgery (discovery group). We determined the optimal cut-off value for disease-free survival (DFS) discrimination using the Contal and O'Quigley method. We also assessed the prognostic significance of the cut-off value in a prospective cohort of 171 stage III colon cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy (validation group).

Results

The optimal cut-off CEA value was 2.1 ng/mL in the discovery group. The DFS rates were significantly poorer in patients with high-normal preoperative CEA levels (2.1–5.0 ng/mL) than in those with low-normal CEA levels (< 2.1 ng/mL) in both groups. A high-normal CEA level was an independent risk factor for DFS in both groups, and was associated with inferior DFS in patients with stage II and III disease and in never or former smokers. The correlation between DFS and CEA levels was more distinct in left-sided colon and rectal cancer.

Conclusions

A high-normal preoperative CEA level (≥ 2.1 ng/mL), even within the normal range, was an independent prognosticator for poor DFS in CRC. The usefulness of CEA was influenced by smoking status and tumor location in addition to tumor stage.

### Individual cutoff levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 indicate recurrence of colorectal cancer with high sensitivity [^114LDCer]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to identify the sensitivity and specificity associated with recurrent colorectal cancer, principally hepatic metastases, with individual cutoff levels of carcinoembryonic antigen; identify the corresponding data for CA 50 and CA 242; compare these findings with standard cutoff levels, clinical examinations, and patients' personal health assessments; and identify the time between increasing serum levels and detection of actual relapses, particularly hepatic metastases.

Methods

A prospective study was performed that included 132 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent and who were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. Serum samples were obtained the first two years after surgery. Marker serum levels were analyzed with the commercial Delfia test kit.

Results

During the sampling period, carcinoembryonic antigen levels were very high or above the individual cutoff level in 21 of 24 cases with recurrent disease. All eight hepatic metastases detected during the sampling period were indicated by carcinoembryonic antigen 0 to 19 months earlier. In the 3rd postoperative year, nine patients with recurrence were identified, and in eight of them, carcinoembryonic antigen rose above the individual cutoff level 23 months before diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity associated with recurrent disease with individual cutoff levels were 79 and 64 percent for carcinoembryonic antigen, 46 and 77 percent for CA 50, and 63 and 76 percent for CA 242, respectively, which was higher than for any other method compared.

Conclusions

With individual cutoff levels, both carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 had high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for indicating recurrent colorectal cancer. Because most (29/33) patients with recurrent disease identified within 3 years after surgery and all 8 with hepatic metastases identified during the sampling period were indicated by carcinoembryonic antigen with the individual cutoff, that method was established as the best for postoperative surveillance.

### Negative serum carcinoembryonic antigen has insufficient accuracy for excluding recurrence from patients with dukes C colorectal cancer: analysis with likelihood ratio and posttest probability in a follow-up study [^115rQExd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring for screening patients with colorectal cancer by using posttest probability of recurrence.

Methods

For this study, 348 (preoperative serum CEA level elevated: CEA+, n = 119; or normal: CEA-, n = 229) patients who had undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer were enrolled. After five-year follow-up with measurements of serum CEA levels and imaging workup, posttest probabilities of recurrence were calculated.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 39 percent of CEA+ patients and 30 percent in CEA- patients, and CEA levels were elevated in 33.3 percent of CEA+ patients and 17.5 percent of CEA- patients. With obtained sensitivity (68.4 percent, CEA+; 41 percent, CEA-), specificity (83 percent, CEA+; 91 percent, CEA-) and likelihood ratio (test positive: 4.0, CEA+; 4.4, CEA-; and test negative: 0.38, CEA+; 0.66, CEA-), posttest probability given the presence of CEA elevation in the CEA+ and CEA- was 72.2 and 65.5 percent, respectively, and that given the absence of CEA elevation was 20 and 22.2 percent, respectively.

Conclusions

Whereas postoperative CEA elevation indicates recurrence with high probability, a normal postoperative CEA is not useful for excluding the probability of recurrence.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^116qBfgJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)–directed exploration and imaging — The Panel does not recommend a so-called blind or CEA-directed laparotomy/laparoscopy when the workup for an increased CEA level is negative, and they do not recommend use of anti–CEA– radiolabeled scintigraphy.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of rectal cancer [^113owKnE]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and other tumor markers in preoperative evaluation — key points are that routine laboratory bloodwork and a CEA level are part of the preoperative evaluation. The baseline CEA level before initiating elective treatment is prognostic of long-term survival and is used as a reference during posttherapy surveillance. Although CEA levels assessed at different time points during multimodality treatment can correlate with treatment response, CEA does not reliably predict pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of other tumor markers such as CA19–9 in the evaluation of patients with rectal cancer.

### Tumour marker requesting in primary care and the role of the laboratory [^115aMKgk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the incidence of multiple tumour marker (TM) requesting in the primary care setting and determine whether the rationale for requesting a TM panel is in agreement with evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

Data-mining software was used to retrospectively identify multiple TM requests and requesting practices of GP surgeries over a 34-month period for α-fetoprotein, CA125, CA15–3, CA19–9, carcinoembryonic antigen and prostate-specific antigen. The appropriateness of each test was reviewed by a clinical biochemist in accordance with National Association of Clinical Biochemistry best-practice guidelines.

Results

505 multiple TM requests were identified which corresponded to 1304 TM tests. Comparison with best-practice guidelines suggested that 68% of request cards contained no appropriate TM request, and 84% of the tests requested were inappropriate.

Conclusion

A review of requesting practices in primary care for TMs highlights the need for laboratories to be more proactive in educating their users on their clinical utility and limitations.

### Association between intensity of posttreatment surveillance testing and detection of recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer [^112oRFBn]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Surveillance testing is performed after primary treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), but it is unclear if the intensity of testing decreases time to detection of recurrence or affects patient survival.

Objective

To determine if intensity of posttreatment surveillance is associated with time to detection of CRC recurrence, rate of recurrence, resection for recurrence, or overall survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study of patient data abstracted from the medical record as part of a Commission on Cancer Special Study merged with records from the National Cancer Database. A random sample of patients (n = 8529) diagnosed with stage I, II, or III CRC treated at a Commission on Cancer-accredited facilities (2006–2007) with follow-up through December 31, 2014.

Exposures

Intensity of imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance testing derived empirically at the facility level using the observed to expected ratio for surveillance testing during a 3-year observation period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to detection of CRC recurrence; secondary outcomes included rates of resection for recurrent disease and overall survival.

Results

A total of 8529 patients (49% men; median age, 67 years) at 1175 facilities underwent surveillance imaging and CEA testing within 3 years after their initial CRC treatment. The cohort was distributed by stage as follows: stage I, 25.0%; stage II, 35.2%; and stage III, 39.8%. Patients treated at high-intensity facilities-4188 patients (49.1%) for imaging and 4136 (48.5%) for CEA testing-underwent a mean of 2.9 (95% CI, 2.8–2.9) imaging scans and a mean of 4.3 (95% CI, 4.2–4.4) CEA tests. Patients treated at low-intensity facilities-4341 patients (50.8%) for imaging and 4393 (51.5%) for CEA testing-underwent a mean of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.6–1.7) imaging scans and a mean of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.6–1.7) CEA tests. Imaging and CEA surveillance intensity were not associated with a significant difference in time to detection of cancer recurrence. The median time to detection of recurrence was 15.1 months (IQR, 8.2–26.3) for patients treated at facilities with high-intensity imaging surveillance and 16.0 months (IQR, 7.9–27.2) with low-intensity imaging surveillance (difference, -0.95 months; 95% CI, -2.59 to 0.68; HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90–1.09) and was 15.9 months (IQR, 8.5–27.5) for patients treated at facilities with high-intensity CEA testing and 15.3 months (IQR, 7.9–25.7) with low-intensity CEA testing (difference, 0.59 months; 95% CI, -1.33 to 2.51; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90–1.11). No significant difference existed in rates of resection for cancer recurrence (HR for imaging, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99–1.51 and HR for CEA testing, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.91–1.39) or overall survival (HR for imaging, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.94–1.08 and HR for CEA testing, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.89–1.03) among patients treated at facilities with high- vs low-intensity imaging or CEA testing surveillance.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients treated for stage I, II, or III CRC, there was no significant association between surveillance intensity and detection of recurrence.

### The impact of carcinoembryonic antigen flare in patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy [^114QjBbf]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) flare may have a favourable response to chemotherapy, but its impact on survival is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of CEA flare and its impact on objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients and Methods

Patients with histologically proven advanced colorectal cancer undergoing first-line chemotherapy with three or more serial CEA measurements (one at baseline and two or more during treatment) were included. Patients were grouped according to CEA kinetic as flare (F), decreasing CEA, normal baseline CEA, stable CEA and increasing CEA (I).

Results

From January 2000 to February 2008, 837 patients were screened of whom 670 were eligible. CEA flare occurred in 78 (11.6%) patients. On multivariate analysis, compared with patients with increasing CEA, patients with CEA flare had a significantly better ORR [I versus F: 11% versus 73%; risk ratio (RR): 27.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.55–81.88; P < 0.001], PFS (median 3.1 versus 8.3 months; RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.26–0.56; P < 0.001) and OS (median 10.9 versus 17.7 months; RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34–0.82; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with patients with rising CEA, flare was an independent favourable predictive and prognostic factor for tumour response and survival.

Colorectal cancer surveillance intensity — risk-adapted intensive follow-up had better 5-year survival than minimal surveillance (50% vs 32%; p < 0.01). Intensive follow-up was defined as office visits and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months in year 3, and every 6 months in years 4 and 5, with abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds every 6 months for 3 years then yearly in years 4 and 5, and chest x-rays were performed yearly. Since this study, minimal follow-up groups have not been included in trials evaluating surveillance strategies for CRC.

Preoperative assessment — evaluation includes a graded directive for history and labs. A cancer-specific history should be obtained eliciting disease-specific symptoms, associated symptoms, family history, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including CEA level, should also be evaluated, as indicated; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence (1B). A cancer-specific history remains a cornerstone of the preoperative evaluation.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^115pxS8H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this prospective cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide definitive advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with measurement of CEA levels when performed per NCCN guidelines. The correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings should be investigated further in larger prospective studies.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen as an independent prognostic factor of recurrence and survival in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases: a systematic review [^11335ety]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We attempted to answer the question of whether serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen provide prognostic information, in terms of survival, in patients resected for colorectal liver metastases, independently of that provided by other commonly used radioclinical and pathologic factors.

Method

We performed a systematic review, without meta-analysis, of the biomedical literature using the methodology recommended by the Committee on Evidence-Based Laboratory Medicine of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine.

Results

Despite the absence of sufficient details about the methods used to measure serum carcinoembryonic antigen in the 14 studies reviewed, strong arguments exist to include preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen measurements in future trials on the subject. In particular, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to be significant in the two studies with the greatest number of patients having a preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen assay, in the four studies with the most recent series of patients, in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used as a continuous variable, and in the study in which preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was used in terms of doubling time. Postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was found to have a prognostic significance in the only two studies that evaluated this variable.

Conclusion

Taking into account the possible reasons for disagreements regarding carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value between the 14 studies reviewed, we propose some recommendations to improve the reproducibility and the quality of future studies in this field. In particular, we stress the need for a higher degree of multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical trials.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^1138KBi6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### CA 19–9 as a marker in addition to CEA to monitor colorectal cancer [^115wLMnK]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the commonly used tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer, and CA 19–9 might be an additional marker. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether CA 19–9 levels can be used to monitor the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer who had no elevated CEA levels. The secondary aim was to determine if preoperative increased levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were associated with mortality.

Materials and Methods

Two sets of data from patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer, were included in a single-center study. First, patients with a minimum of 3 serial measurements of CA 19–9 and CEA tumor markers were related to the clinical course of their disease. Second, patients with preoperative levels of CEA and CA 19–9 were related to survival.

Results

In patients with colorectal cancer and 3 serial measurements of tumor markers, 7.3% had only increased CA 19–9 levels without increased CEA levels, and 55.4% of the patients had an increase of CA 19–9 and CEA levels. In the patients with available preoperative markers, patients with only an increase of CA 19–9 had a significantly decreased 5-year survival compared with patients with an increase of only CEA (P = .013).

Conclusion

CA 19–9 can be used as additional marker to follow the disease process in patients with colorectal cancer without an increase in CEA level. Patients with preoperative increased CA 19–9 level had a poorer 5-year survival than patients with preoperative increased CEA levels.

### Assessing the prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen-specific T-cell responses in colorectal cancer [^114BiRhQ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

CEA-specific T-cell responsiveness could also reflect more advanced tumor stages, ie, presence of micrometastases that are not demonstrated by conventional staging techniques. Whilst further studies are required to uncover why CEA-specific T-cells confer harm, it is clear that measuring these responses could offer crucial prognostic information independent of tumor stage and help identify patients at risk for tumor recurrence. Although this particular study was limited by the relatively small sample size without a validation cohort and by the fact that immunological data were not available for all patients, the conclusions from this study raise the possibility that targeting adjuvant treatments at CEA + T-cell responders may improve treatment outcome.

### Validation of combined carcinoembryonic antigen and glucose testing in pancreatic cyst fluid to differentiate mucinous from non-mucinous cysts [^117S59F2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are increasingly detected incidentally on radiological imaging, with a reported weighted incidence of up to 49% in the general population, increasing with age. PCN compromise a heterogeneous group of lesions, ranging from benign to (pre)malignant entities. Mucinous PCN are considered (pre)malignant and thus require follow-up or surgical resection according to current international guidelines. On the other hand, non-mucinous PCN do not require surveillance or intervention. Thus, in order to prevent unnecessary surgery with associated mortality, morbidity, and costs, it is essential to accurately distinguish mucinous from non-mucinous PCN. However, differentiating different types of PCN remains challenging in daily clinical patient care. Even if best practice according to the clinical guidelines is applied, only 72% of PCN are diagnosed correctly and adequate differentiation between mucinous and non-mucinous PCN is made in 86%. Thus, improving accurate distinction between mucinous and non-mucinous PCN is essential in order to: (1) prevent lifelong futile follow-up of non-mucinous cysts, (2) allow for timely intervention in (pre)malignant PCN, and (3) avoid futile major abdominal surgery in wrongly diagnosed mucinous PCN.

Biochemical testing of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) obtained by endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is often used during diagnostic workup as it improves diagnostic accuracy in differentiating mucinous from non-mucinous PCN. From a clinical perspective, easily accessible biochemical markers to accurately analyze PCF are a crucial necessity in daily patient care. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is frequently used for this purpose and has the ability to distinguish mucinous from non-mucinous PCN with a sensitivity of 52–73% and a specificity of 77–89% using a cut-off value of 192 ng/mL. Nevertheless, the optimal cut-off value of CEA is still under debate, as underlined by data from a recently performed individual patient meta-analysis in 365 patients showing that a lower cut-off value of 20 ng/mL achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy [sensitivity 91% (95%CI 88–94%); specificity 85% (95%CI 72–93%)].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^11496pu1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Less common ovarian cancers (LCOC) — workup for a pelvic mass mirrors that for other ovarian cancers but includes targeted tumor markers and assessments. Tumor markers may include CA-125, inhibin, beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Individuals younger than 35 years with a pelvic mass should have AFP levels measured to assess for germ cell tumors and to rule out pregnancy. A GI tract evaluation is recommended for mucinous histology to determine whether an occult GI primary has metastasized to the ovaries. An intraoperative frozen section evaluation is recommended for those who would like to maintain their fertility.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen directed PET-CECT scanning for postoperative surveillance of colorectal cancer [^115KcswS]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

During the follow-up of surgically resected colorectal cancer (CRC), positron emission tomography-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (PET-CECT) is indicated for asymptomatic elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) > 5 ng/ml and no obvious site of recurrence on clinical examination and basic imaging. As an institutional policy, a PET-CECT scan was performed at our institute whenever (1) CEA levels rose above 5 ng/ml and (2) CEA values were doubled (even if the CEA level was < 5 ng/ml). Our aim was to correlate the range of CEA elevation with recurrence rates and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of PET-CECT scanning in this setting.

Method

We retrospectively analysed all cases where a PET-CECT scan was performed for elevated CEA levels during surveillance visits after complete resection of the primary tumour followed by adjuvant therapy. This study was conducted from 1 January 2013 to 31 July 2015.

Results

In all, 104 patients underwent a PET-CECT scan for rising CEA values, and 62 patients (59.6%) were found to have recurrent disease. At CEA levels < 5, 5.1–10, 10.1–15, 15.1–50 and > 50 ng/ml, disease recurred in 10%, 45%, 70%, 94% and 100% patients, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the PET-CECT scan were 92.7%, 95.2%, 96.2% and 90.9%, respectively. Elevation of CEA levels during follow-up was indicative of recurrence in 68% of the secretors and 45% of the non-secretors (based on baseline CEA status).

Conclusion

In the setting of rising CEA levels during follow-up of patients with CRC, a PET-CECT scan is a valuable tool to detect recurrence, irrespective of the baseline CEA secretor status. The likelihood of recurrence of disease was directly proportional to the value of the raised CEA level.

### Risk prediction models for colorectal cancer in people with symptoms: a systematic review [^116JTKFC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of a two-step process into the recently updated NICE referral guidelines, in which the referral decision for individuals at intermediate risk is made based on the result of testing for occult blood in faeces, also provides an opportunity for research into incorporating other pre-referral tests into risk models. These include faecal immunochemical tests and potentially more specialised tests, such as exfoliated DNA and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which were of predictive value in secondary care developed models.

From work in other disease areas we know that uncertainty about how to account for risk factors perceived to be important but not included in the tools, and the perception that clinical judgement is as good as or better than risk tools, contribute to the low uptake of risk models. Practical issues such as lack of time, poor knowledge or understanding of the tools, and poor computer software also restrict model use. Additionally, a recent study using simulated consultations with risk prediction tools for cancer has shown that clinicians may interpret symptoms inconsistently, leading to inaccurate and unreliable cancer risk assessment, and GPs were reluctant to use the tools for fear of alarming their patients if the risk information is presented too explicitly. Research is therefore also needed to understand how best to incorporate risk prediction models into routine practice, including communication of risk information to patients, and to address the barriers to their use.

### Choosing wisely in oncology: are guidelines effective at preventing unnecessary diagnostics? The example of surveillance positron emission tomography for patients with localised colorectal cancer [^113qbsiF]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In all healthcare systems around the world, using appropriate diagnostic approaches is important for both patients and payers. For patients, it is important to balance the need to diagnose serious disease, against the risk of overdiagnosis. For payers, the costs of using diagnostic testing must be balanced against the clinical benefit that the testing provides. For healthcare systems with finite availability of certain tests, the appropriate policy must ensure that such tests are available for those that need them. It has been well recognised that sometimes, there is overuse of certain diagnostic techniques. In order to provide a framework to consider such overuse, the 'Choosing Wisely' campaign was developed by the American Board of Internal Medicine, and its recommendations have been adopted by many professional organisations around the world. The recommendations have been considered to be only for advisory purposes to guide clinician decision-making.

In the field of oncology, many 'Choosing Wisely' recommendations focus on the appropriate use of advanced imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PETCT). One such recommendation specifically stated in 2013 ' Avoid using PET or PET-CT scanning as part of routine follow-up care to monitor for a cancer recurrence in asymptomatic patients who have finished initial treatment to eliminate the cancer unless there is high-level evidence that such imaging will change the outcome'. In the field of colorectal cancer (CRC), it is recommended that patients treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy should not undergo surveillance with PETCT imaging. This recommendation against surveillance PETCT is supported by guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, The European Society of Medical Oncology, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, The Society of Surgical Oncologyand The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland. The recommendations are underpinned by randomised controlled clinical trial data reported in 2018 by Sobhani et al. In this study, 239 patients undergoing surveillance with physical examination, liver ultrasound, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CT were randomised to groups with or without PETCT every 6 months. There was no difference in rates of unresectable recurrence or death from any cause.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^116ngyqB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay (Signatera; Natera) has been marketed for use in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer despite limited data supporting such practice.

Objective

To compare a ctDNA assay with standard radiographic imaging and measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluated surveillance strategies of ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer from September 1, 2019, to November 30, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA, imaging, measurement of CEA levels, and combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels in detecting a confirmed recurrence of colorectal disease. A confirmed recurrence was defined asa positivectDNA finding or a finding on imaging confirmed by biopsy, CEA level elevation, or subsequent tumor radiographic dynamics.

Results

A total of 48 patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study (28 men [58.3%]; median age, 60 [IQR, 34–85] years) and underwent surveillance by ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels. Fifteen patients had disease recurrence during surveillance. Positive ctDNA findings confirmed disease recurrence in 8 patients; imaging, in 9 patients; CEA levels, in 3 patients; and combined imaging plus CEA levels, in 11 patients. Numerically, ctDNA did not perform better than imaging in detecting recurrence, with sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), respectively (P > .99). The combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (sensitivity, 73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]) had a numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in identifying recurrence (P = .55). In addition, no significant difference was noted among ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging (median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (median, 15.0 months) in the time to identify disease recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide advantages as a surveillance strategy compared with standard imaging combined with CEA levels when performed per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

### Follow-up care, surveillance protocol, and secondary prevention measures for survivors of colorectal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline endorsement [^117VXjvi]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing recent clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations.

Methods

The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Guideline on Follow-up Care, Surveillance Protocol, and Secondary Prevention Measures for Survivors of Colorectal Cancer was reviewed by ASCO for methodologic rigor and considered for endorsement.

Results

The ASCO Panel concurred with the CCO recommendations and recommended endorsement, with the addition of several qualifying statements.

Conclusion

Surveillance should be guided by presumed risk of recurrence and functional status of the patient (important within the first 2 to 4 years). Medical history, physical examination, and carcinoembryonic antigen testing should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence should be considered for testing in the more frequent end of the range. A computed tomography scan (abdominal and chest) is recommended annually for 3 years, in most cases. Positron emission tomography scans should not be used for surveillance outside of a clinical trial. A surveillance colonoscopy should be performed 1 year after the initial surgery and then every 5 years, dictated by the findings of the previous one. If a colonoscopy was not preformed before diagnosis, it should be done after completion of adjuvant therapy (before 1 year). Secondary prevention (maintaining a healthy body weight and active lifestyle) is recommended. If a patient is not a candidate for surgery or systemic therapy because of severe comorbid conditions, surveillance tests should not be performed. A treatment plan from the specialist should have clear directions on appropriate follow-up by a nonspecialist.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^117JLWf2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Ovarian cancer — serum tumor markers in preoperative workup and monitoring: CA-125 testing is included as a possible element of preoperative workup when clinically indicated, supported by its correlation with extent of disease, potential prognostic value, and usefulness for monitoring response and surveillance. For HE4, evidence suggests prognostic value and potential earlier detection of recurrence, and panel members sometimes test it for future monitoring in patients without elevated CA-125; however, the guidelines currently do not recommend routine HE4 as part of preoperative workup. In addition to CA-125, other markers may be used preoperatively if clinically indicated — namely inhibin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA19–9 — to help assess for less common ovarian cancers and facilitate future surveillance, especially when CA-125 is not elevated or is less informative.

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring after curative resection for colorectal cancer: clinical significance of the preoperative level [^114J6trZ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

We evaluated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer and determined when surveillance of this marker was useful.

Methods

Serum CEA was measured preoperatively in 1,263 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer at 3-month intervals for the first 2 postoperative years and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 1–156 months).

Results

The 5-year disease-free survival was less in patients with a high preoperative serum CEA level (P < 0.0001). Among patients with a tumor recurrence, 38.5% had high follow-up serum CEA levels. The number of patients with high postoperative serum CEA levels exceeded the number of patients with high preoperative levels. High preoperative and follow-up serum CEA levels were independent prognostic factors for tumor recurrence (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). In patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels, CEA surveillance had a 92.3% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV). The mean interval between postoperative serum CEA elevation and the diagnosis of a tumor recurrence [diagnostic interval (DI)] was 2.5 months (range 5–17 months). The DI was 0 in 18.8% of patients with a tumor recurrence.

Conclusion

High serum CEA levels preoperatively and at follow-up are prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. Postoperative serum CEA surveillance is used most effectively when patients have high preoperative serum CEA levels. Considering the DI of 0 in 18.8% of the patients, the current CEA surveillance schedule might be changed.

### Pulmonary metastasectomy: what is the practice and where is the evidence for effectiveness? [^1118mtsG]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Role of tumour markers in the selection of patients

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and α fetoprotein are used in non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT) in order to detect persistent or recurrent tumour.

An elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of more than 5 μg/L is characteristic of CRC but may also occur in mesothelioma and a number of other tumours. It is raised in 3%, 25%, 45% and 65% of Dukes' A, B, C and D, respectively.CEA falls after curative resection, and its subsequent elevation is particularly associated with liver metastases. An elevated CEA is associated with poor outcome after pulmonary metastasectomy for patients with CRC, which has led to the paradoxical situation where CEA elevation may trigger investigations that lead to referral for pulmonary metastasectomy while the same blood test is later a reason to decide against metastasectomy. Investigation and surgery triggered by CEA elevation have been shown to not improve survival.

Very large numbers of tumour marker assays are ordered, many inappropriately, at high cost in themselves, and leading to further investigations that may be of no benefit.

### Colorectal cancer surveillance: 2005 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline [^111KJDVm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2000 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on colorectal cancer surveillance.

Recommendations

Based on results from three independently reported meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that compared low-intensity and high-intensity programs of colorectal cancer surveillance, and on recent analyses of data from major clinical trials in colon and rectal cancer, the Panel recommends annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen for 3 years after primary therapy for patients who are at higher risk of recurrence and who could be candidates for curative-intent surgery; pelvic CT scan for rectal cancer surveillance, especially for patients with several poor prognostic factors, including those who have not been treated with radiation; colonoscopy at 3 years after operative treatment, and, if results are normal, every 5 years thereafter; flexible proctosigmoidoscopy every 6 months for 5 years for rectal cancer patients who have not been treated with pelvic radiation; history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, every 6 months during years 4 and 5, and subsequently at the discretion of the physician; and carcinoembryonic antigen every 3 months postoperatively for at least 3 years after diagnosis, if the patient is a candidate for surgery or systemic therapy. Chest x-rays, CBCs, and liver function tests are not recommended, and molecular or cellular markers should not influence the surveillance strategy based on available evidence.

### Association of preoperative and postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen and colon cancer outcome [^116HVHg2]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend measuring preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with colon cancer. Although persistently elevated CEA after surgery has been associated with increased risk for metastatic disease, prognostic significance of elevated preoperative CEA that normalized after resection is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether patients with elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after colon cancer resection have a higher risk of recurrence than patients with normal preoperative CEA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma at the center from January 2007 to December 2014 were identified.

Exposures

Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: normal preoperative CEA, elevated preoperative but normalized postoperative CEA, and elevated preoperative and postoperative CEA.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and hazard function curves over time were analyzed.

Results

A total of 1027 patients (461 [50.4%] male; median [IQR] age, 64 [53–75] years) were identified. Patients with normal preoperative CEA had 7.4% higher 3-year RFS (n = 715 [89.7%]) than the combined cohorts with elevated preoperative CEA (n = 312 [82.3%]) (P = .01) but had RFS similar to that of patients with normalized postoperative CEA (n = 142 [87.9%]) (P = .86). Patients with elevated postoperative CEA had 14.9% lower RFS (n = 57 [74.5%]) than the combined cohorts with normal postoperative CEA (n = 857 [89.4%]) (P = .001). The hazard function of recurrence for elevated postoperative CEA peaked earlier than for the other cohorts. Multivariate analyses confirmed that elevated postoperative CEA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.5), but not normalized postoperative CEA (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45–1.30), was independently associated with shorter RFS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated preoperative CEA that normalizes after resection is not an indicator of poor prognosis. Routine measurement of postoperative, rather than preoperative, CEA is warranted. Patients with elevated postoperative CEA are at increased risk for recurrence, especially within the first 12 months after surgery.

### A small rise in CEA is sensitive for recurrence after surgery for colorectal cancer [^113YMzMj]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Rise in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above normal limits can indicate recurrent colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a small rise in CEA, even within normal limits was a sensitive indicator of recurrence.

Method

150 patients aged 22–87 years were followed up for a mean of 27 months after colorectal surgery with CEA 3 and 6 monthly computerized tomography. We analysed whether a rise in CEA > 1 ng/ml correlated with recurrence of metastases.

Results

Forty-six of 139 patients in final analysis had recurrent disease. A rise in CEA > 1 had a predictive value of 74% for recurrence or metastases (sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%). These findings were similar whether or not the CEA was normal preoperatively.

Conclusion

If CEA is measured after surgery for colorectal cancer, a rise of > 1 in the patient's postoperative value is predictive for recurrence or metastases with an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 86%. Previous studies have recognized the role of large rises in CEA in predicting recurrence but this study shows that small changes in CEA may be significant even if these levels would be traditionally within 'normal' limits.

### Prognostic significance of postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with completely resected pathological-stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^116Pn2ge]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In many clinical practices, serum tumor markers are easily and reproducibly evaluated. Measurement of tumor markers in patients with malignancies enables us to diagnose, quantitatively assess cancer cells, predict survival, and monitor the effects of treatment.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most commonly used tumor markers in gastrointestinal and lung cancers. Many reports have already described the significant correlation of preoperative CEA levels with prognosis in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, serum CEA levels are known to be affected by the rate of CEA elimination from circulating blood determined by renal function and smoking status.

From this perspective, postoperative CEA levels might be a more accurate prognostic factor than preoperative CEA levels, because the former is less affected by preoperative smoking status. Dent et al. initially reported high values of postoperative CEA levels. Subsequent reports demonstrated that high postoperative CEA levels predicted recurrence and prognosis in NSCLC patients. Until date, however, there are no clear recommendations for regular perioperative measurements of serum CEA levels for lung cancer in any guidelines.

We conducted a retrospective study based on a single institution to evaluate the prognostic importance of perioperative serum CEA levels in patients with completely resected pathological-stage I NSCLC.

### Prediagnostic levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 in colorectal cancer: a matched case-control study [^112DSYT7]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Carcinoembryonic antigen is the classical tumor marker for colorectal cancer. The main clinical utility is in monitoring patients with colorectal cancer. Like carcinoembryonic antigen, the plasma level of CA 242 is elevated in patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and/or CA 242 were elevated before clinical diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

Methods

The Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort was linked to the Swedish National and Regional Cancer registries, and 124 prospective cases with colorectal cancer were identified. Two referents for each case were randomly selected and matched for gender, age, date of sampling, and fasting time. Plasma from the included patients was analyzed for carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 using specific immunoassays.

Results

An elevated level of carcinoembryonic antigen before diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of developing manifest colorectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1–29.1; P = 0.002). An elevated level of CA 242 was not significantly related to colorectal cancer risk. Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels were only seen in samples collected in the two-year time interval immediately before diagnosis. In this group, 30.4 percent of all plasma samples from cases were carcinoembryonic antigen-positive and 71.4 percent were future Dukes A or B cases. The specificity of the carcinoembryonic antigen test for identifying future colorectal cancer patients was 0.99 with a sensitivity of 0.12. For CA 242 the specificity was 0.92 and the sensitivity was 0.1.

Conclusions

Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels strongly indicate occult colorectal cancer. Although the specificity of the carcinoembryonic antigen test in its present form is high, the sensitivity is disappointingly low, prohibiting the use of the carcinoembryonic antigen test for mass screening.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^113Vc55q]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study is limited by its small size, small number of recurrences, and short follow-up. We defined ctDNA-detected recurrence as a true recurrence despite the lack of a mandate of a radiographic progression; however, our decision to proceed with such a definition was based on supporting evidence that persistent ctDNA positivity has been associated with recurrence in all patients in 2 studies. In addition, delayed recurrences have been seen in patients with colorectal cancer, although infrequently. Hence, the lack of radiographic recurrence, even at 5 years, in a patient with persistent ctDNA positivity does not preclude the presence of minimal residual disease or later recurrences. Nonetheless, all our patients with ctDNA-detected relapses did eventually experience radiographic recurrence and hence represent true-positive findings by radiographic criteria, adding further strength to our findings. Our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between measurement of CEA levels and ctDNA, as well as combined measurement of CEA levels and imaging, probably reflecting that our analysis is underpowered by the small sample size. Additional limitations include the heterogenous patient population by stage and treatment, which may limit the generalization of our data within different populations with colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, the correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings is striking and calls for larger prospective studies to assess the sensitivity of ctDNA vs standard of care surveillance. Such studies should be standardized to include intensive surveillance approaches as supported by NCCN and ESMO guidelines.

### Diagnostic accuracy of serum-carcinoembryonic antigen in recurrent colorectal cancer: a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [^117TvWGm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Serial measurements of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are frequently used in the follow-up after colorectal cancer (CRC), but its usefulness remains debatable. Choosing the appropriate cut-off point is crucial to the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of continuous test variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis is the appropriate statistical method for this purpose, but has not been applied in previous studies.

Methods

One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients surgically treated with curative intent for CRC between July 1996 and June 1999 had systematic follow-up for five years. Follow-up included imaging, coloscopy and serial CEA measurements. Complete data including CEA measurements were available from 153 patients. ROC analysis of CEA was done with regard to detection of recurrent disease.

Results

Depending on the chosen cut-off value of CEA, DA varied widely within the normal range (CEA ≤ 10 U/ml). CEA > 4 U/ml provided the highest sensitivity (0.78) and specificity (0.91), compared to a sensitivity and specificity at the upper normal range (CEA = 10 U/ml) of 0.51 and 0.99, respectively. Thirty-three patients (24%) developed recurrence. Among 11 (5%) asymptomatic patients diagnosed by elevated CEA levels, only two patients (1.5%) were amenable to secondary curative surgery. A threefold increase of CEA in an individual patient had the same DA as the best cut-off value (> 4 U/ml).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy of CEA in follow-up after curative surgery for CRC is influenced by the chosen cut-off value. A threefold increase of CEA may indicate recurrent disease. The value of serial measurement of CEA was limited.

### Conditional survival and the prognostic value of serum carcinoembryonic antigen level in oldest old with colorectal cancer [^113yLArD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide. As the average lifespan increases, the number of elderly patients (≥ 85 years old) with CRC has also increased. Patients aged 85 and above are often considered the oldest-old.

In the United States, the median age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer is 67 years, and 11.2% of new cases occur in individuals over the age of 84. The oldest-old category comprises 20.6% of the total deaths caused by CRC. The oldest-old is a specific population in CRC, characterized by multiple comorbidities with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is inadequate for accurately assessing the prognosis of CRC Therefore, there is a need for improvement of the current staging system.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a highly glycosylated 201 kDa antigen expressed on the apical surface of colon epithelial cells and excreted through the intestinal cavity. CEA is the most widely used blood-based molecular marker for CRC and has been shown to play an important role in monitoring disease progression and predicting disease prognosis. The AJCC Colorectal Working Group recommended the inclusion of serum CEA levels (C stage) to complement and modify the anatomic TNM staging of CRC in early 2000.

The present study was a large population-based study designed to evaluate the clinical value of serum CEA levels and their impact on the diagnostic value of the conventional TNM staging system in the oldest-old patients with CRC.

### Blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen level for detecting recurrence of colorectal cancer [^115y5T1x]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at specific carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) thresholds for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer?

Bottom Line

To detect colorectal cancer recurrence, the sensitivity of CEA ranges from 68% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 82% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L and the specificity ranges from 97% for a threshold of 10 µg/L to 80% for a threshold of 2.5 µg/L.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^111F5wf8]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

A large body of investigational data demonstrates that the prognosis of patients undergoing bowel resection for colorectal cancer is mainly determined by factors related to local tumour growth and the presence or absence of nodal and/or distant metastases. Many classification systems have been devised to categorise these anatomical factors for clinical use but an increasing number of new pathological and nonanatomical elements show interesting correlations with survival and would be worth testing systematically for selective integration into the available staging classifications. Improvement of the prognostic accuracy of these classifications might allow a more flexible use of the increasing number of new drugs and therapeutic options now available for postsurgical management of patients with colorectal cancer. However, since this malignancy is a disease of the elderly and the populations of developed countries are ageing rapidly, overall survival, as currently investigated, may not be the most suitable outcome parameter for evaluating the real prognostic impact of tumour-linked factors. Because about one-half of all colorectal carcinomas in our series occur in people aged 65 years or older, and a considerable number of these subjects die of other causes with no evidence of cancer, a fraction of these deaths should not be related to the tumour.

There are two main purposes of the present work: (1) to verify the prognostic significance of the current clinicopathological factors through a study of both overall and relative survival, this latter being a selective estimate of the chance of surviving the effects of cancer; (2) to include – among the factors to be tested – the linear dimensions of the resected tumour as an estimate of its preoperative volume. Tumour size has never shown a clear prognostic value, but its potential effect has always been evaluated through overall survival analyses, in which it has shown a satisfying correlation with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) levels. Since these markers are commonly considered of prognostic value, but are inconstantly expressed, a re-evaluation of the predictive value of tumour size through an analysis of relative survival might yield definitive results on this matter.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen is the preferred biomarker for in vivo colorectal cancer targeting [^111eC45L]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

In practical imaging situations, the threshold, or cutoff, used to differentiate between normal and tumour would be determined by the user, by adjusting the signal gain. This could be altered to favour either sensitivity (lowering the cutoff to detect tumours more easily at the risk of detecting normal tissue erroneously) or specificity (raising the cutoff to avoid detection of normal tissue at the risk of missing tumour cells). We quantified the abilities of the markers to be used in tumour cell detection using their optimal cutoffs, as determined using ROC analyses, in terms of sensitivity (proportion of tumours correctly detected) and specificity (proportion of normal tissues correctly not detected). Carcinoembryonic antigen was the most sensitive marker by a considerable margin (93.7%, as compared with the nearest alternative TAG-72 at 70.3%), and was also highly specific (96.1%). Folate receptor- α was the most specific marker (99.2%); however, its utility is limited by the fact that it was not detectable in the majority of tumours, as previously reported, resulting in a poor sensitivity (39.3%). In addition, the magnitude of differential expression between normal and tumour was relatively narrow, providing less security in determining tumour or normal identities. Most notably, EGFR was a surprisingly poor marker, being detected in less than half the tumours and being commonly more highly expressed in normal tissues than in tumours. For applications aiming at targeted delivery of therapeutics, similar considerations apply. Markers must allow a balance between ensuring tumour cells receive the cytotoxic insult while minimising collateral damage in normal cells that may express the antigen. In this context, FR α may be an appropriate target in the tumours that express it, with very high specificity allowing minimal damage to normal cells. However, CEA is more suitable in a much larger proportion of tumours, accepting that normal tissues may suffer some dose of drug, albeit a much lower dose than the tumour cells.

We therefore conclude that of the four biomarkers tested, CEA alone is the most suitable for tumour targeting, and this should be reflected in future strategies for in vivo tumour diagnosis and therapeutic delivery.

### Is it reasonable to add preoperative serum level of CEA and CA19–9 to staging for colorectal cancer? [^114XYyUY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) are the most common tumor markers for colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of adding them into the current staging system by analyzing their prognostic significance.

Materials and Methods

The study population was patients (n = 574, 67.1 ± 11.3 years old, 397 males) who received potentially curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma (stage I-III) between January 1994 and August 2002, including preoperative measurements of CEA and CA19–9. Clinicopathological characteristics and associated follow-up data were retrospectively collected by reviewing available medical charts. CEA higher or equal to 5 ng/ml was defined as abnormal (CEA+). The CA19–9 level was set at 37 U/ml (CA19–9+). Patients were further divided into four groups (1, 2, 3, 4) according to the results of these two markers (CEA/CA19–9: -/-, -/+, ±, and +/+). Survival was analyzed for AJCC staging, CEA (+) versus (-), CA19–9 (+) versus (-), and four groups.

Results

CEA and CA19–9 survival curves were not significantly different. However, the combined use of the two markers revealed a significant survival benefit (P = 0.035) of group 1 ("-" for both markers) over 4 ("+" for both) in stage II.

Conclusions

Patients with an elevated level of both CEA and CA19–9 in stage II of colorectal cancer have a significantly poorer prognosis than those with normal levels of these markers. We recommend adding both CEA and CA19–9 to the current staging system.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111ssa1N]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) surveillance after R0 resection: CEA follow-up is described as every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. Approximately half of elevations were false positives, mostly 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results > 15 ng/mL were rare, and all results > 35 ng/mL represented true positives. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CEA at a cutoff of 10 ng/mL were 68% (95% CI, 53–79) and 97% (95% CI, 90–99), respectively. In the first 2 years post-resection, a CEA cutoff of 10 ng/mL is estimated to detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives.

### Community compliance with carcinoembryonic antigen: follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer [^116Kzz5h]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine whether recommendations for surveillance carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing in stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) are adhered to upon discharge from our cancer center, patterns of care after CEA elevation, and whether differences in outcomes exist between patients who did and did not receive recommended CEA monitoring.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective, single-institution chart review was completed at the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) in Edmonton, Alberta. The Alberta Cancer Registry (ACR) identified patients with CRC diagnosed between January 1 and December 31, 2001. Patients with stage II/III CRC seen and/or treated at the CCI and later discharged to the community with follow-up recommendations based on American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines were included. Carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring ≥ every 4 months for ≥ 2 years was deemed acceptable for study purposes.

Results

The ACR identified 152 stage II/III CRC cases meeting inclusion criteria. Eleven patients (7.2%) received the minimum predefined CEA follow-up. Eighty-seven CEA follow-up tests were elevated; only 20 (23%) elevated CEAs were investigated with predefined timely intervention. Twenty-six patients (17.1%) had documentable tumor recurrence. There was no difference in overall survival or time to recurrence between the groups who received and did not receive appropriate follow-up, although small numbers limit the effectiveness of statistical analysis.

Conclusion

Post-therapy surveillance is important in CRC management. Our study reveals follow-up recommendations based on best available evidence for interval CEA testing are not followed in the community. These findings suggest the need for review of recommendations and change in management for monitoring discharged patients with stage II/III CRC.

### Effect of 3 to 5 years of scheduled CEA and CT follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer: the FACS randomized clinical trial [^117Pizhn]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intensive follow-up after surgery for colorectal cancer is common practice but is based on limited evidence.

Objective

To assess the effect of scheduled blood measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and computed tomography (CT) as follow-up to detect recurrent colorectal cancer treatable with curative intent.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: CEA only (n = 300), CT only (n = 299), CEA+CT (n = 302), or minimum follow-up (n = 301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent.

Results

After a mean 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to Dukes staging (stage A, 5.1% [13/254]; stage B, 6.1% [34/553]; stage C, 6.2% [22/354]). Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the CEA group, 8% (24/299) in the CT group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the CEA+CT group. Compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the CEA group was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23–7.33), in the CT group was 5.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.51–8.69), and in the CEA+CT group was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10–8.71). The number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (CEA, CT, and CEA+CT; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 7.1%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or CEA screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining CEA and CT. If there is a survival advantage to any strategy, it is likely to be small.

### Characterizing surveillance recommendations from National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines [^115vAQHf]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Forty-three guidelines provided 483 recommendations across 99 cancer types (Table 1). Four hundred fifty recommendations (93%) of recommendations were assigned category 2A evidence (ie, lower-level evidence with uniform consensus). Although 327 recommendations (68%) were stratified by stage, treatment, or a combination of factors, only 116 (24%) called for individualizing surveillance testing to patient-specific factors (eg, measuring a tumor marker only when initially elevated).

Table 1.
Frequency and Duration Characteristics of Surveillance Recommendations With Select Examples

Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood count; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen; CT, computed tomography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PSA, prostate specific antigen.

Two hundred twenty-two recommendations (46%) were for imaging, mostly using cross-sectional modalities. Laboratory tests were advised in 109 recommendations (23%), with near-equal distribution across routine (eg, chemistry panel), specialty (eg, hormone panel), and tumor marker laboratory tests. A history and physical or focused clinical examination was recommended in 106 cases (22%), followed by endoscopy in 31 (6%), and pathology testing in 15 cases (3%).

Most recommendations (337 of 483 [70%]) provided guidance on evaluation frequency. Of these, 215 (64%) suggested frequency as a range, and 216 (64%) advised lengthening the interval over time. Regarding duration, 234 (48%) defined an end point and 15 (3%) recommended surveillance testing indefinitely or until cancer progression. An equal number (234 of 483 [48%]) deferred surveillance duration to clinical judgment (ie, "as clinically indicated") or did not specify further.

### Circulating biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring of anti-cancer agents [^114H3K6y]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Tumor Markers

Extensive efforts have been invested into identifying tumor markers with greater specificity in evaluating tumor burden and response to therapy. Biomarkers with variable clinical utility have been proposed, including those that attempt to recapitulate the tumor burden of cancers with certain histopathological origins.

Cancer Antigen 125

Bast et al first suggested CA 125 (MUC16) as a diagnostic marker of epithelial ovarian cancer in 1983. At present, CA 125 maintains a role in monitoring disease response and is recommended alongside imaging criteria for response assessment in relapsed ovarian cancer by the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup. Despite this, the use of CA 125 elevation as a threshold for initiating treatment before radiological disease recurrence has not been linked to an improvement in OS. Moreover, the sensitivity of CA 125 declines in heavily treated ovarian cancer that is resistant to platinum chemotherapy, reflecting a potential concerning dynamic change in test performance as cancer biology evolves.

Prostate-Specific Antigen

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease which is exclusively produced by prostatic epithelium and escapes into circulation in the setting of malignancy. Blood PSA levels are highly specific for disease recurrence and are also directly linked with survival outcomes in advanced disease. Serum PSA is routinely used to assess disease response in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with either chemotherapy or androgen receptor axis-targeted treatment. Indeed, PSA is included in standard response assessment criteria in castrate-resistant prostate cancer put forth by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3. A notable exception to this would be prostate tumors with neuroendocrine features without significant PSA production.

Carcinoembryonic Antigen

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is an adhesion molecule involved in signal transduction within adenocarcinomas. Increased serum CEA levels have been described in breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian malignancies but can also be observed in benign conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, cigarette smoking, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, liver disease, and alcohol consumption. Although CEA has a weak role as a screening tool for colorectal cancer (CRC), it has been validated as a prognostic biomarker and surrogate of disease burden pre-operatively for patients undergoing CRC resection, as well as a predictor of disease recurrence during follow-up. Stable CEA levels are associated with significantly improved PFS in patients with unresectable metastatic CRC.

### Concordance of carcinoembryonic antigen ratio and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors as prognostic surrogate indicators of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy [^115HbY5r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is widely used as a tumor marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate the role of the degree of change in CEA levels during the treatment period and found that the degree of change highly correlated with disease survival and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in evaluating therapy response.

Methods

A total of 447 metastatic CRC patients treated with surgery of the primary tumor followed by systemic therapy at a single center from the year 2000 through 2011 were reviewed. The degree of change in CEA levels was expressed as the CEA ratio (post-CEA/pre-CEA) and classified into four groups during the treatment period for further evaluation. The imaging change of the same population was also compared with the CEA ratio during the treatment period.

Results

The CEA ratio was significantly correlated with different chemotherapy regimens (p < 0.001), pre-treatment CEA level (p < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.006), and tumor differentiation (p = 0.018). CEA ratio and imaging change according to RECIST criteria were both correlated with overall survival (p < 0.001). These two methods for evaluating treatment response were highly correlated (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

CEA ratio was found to be a reliable prognostic factor in stage IV CRC, and was highly correlated with the imaging survey according to RECIST criteria. Further prospective studies are essential to validate these findings.

Managing an increasing CEA level — after resection should include colonoscopy; chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans; physical examination; and consideration of a PET/CT scan, and if imaging is normal in the face of a rising CEA, repeat CT scans are recommended every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. In a retrospective review, approximately half of elevations were false positives, with most in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results > 15 ng/mL were rare, and all results > 35 ng/mL represented true positives. For CEA at a cutoff of 10 ng/mL, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 68% (95% CI, 53%–79%) and 97% (95% CI, 90%–99%), and in the first 2 years post-resection this cutoff is estimated to detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^112s4RBa]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

More recently, several studies have evaluated ctDNA as a surveillance strategy for resected colorectal cancer. Signatera (Natera) is a personalized, tumor-informed, multiplex polymerase chain reaction–based next-generation sequencing assay for ctDNA detection. Reveal (Guardant Health, Inc) is a tumor agnostic assay that simultaneously evaluates genomic mutations and methylations to detect residual disease and colorectal disease recurrence. Both assays are commercially available in the US. Many clinicians have elected to incorporate these ctDNA-based assays in the surveillance of resected colorectal cancer, despite limited supportive clinical data. The enthusiasm around these assays, particularly Signatera, was generated by a large observational surveillance trialthat evaluated CEA levels, CT imaging, and ctDNA in patients with stage I to III colorectal cancer. In that study, patients underwent postoperative surveillance by ctDNA assay (Signatera) after adjuvant therapy and every 3 months for 36 months (along with measurement of CEA levels) and by radiographic imaging at 1 and 3 years as per the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group guidelines. This study showed that ctDNA assay identified disease recurrence at a median of 8.7 months before radiographic recurrence. The relevance of such clinical findings should be taken in the context of the surveillance frequency of imaging studies. The Danish Colorectal Cancer Group guidelines for CT surveillance frequency are considered substandard in the US by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and NCCN guidelines and are considered substandard in many European countries according to ESMO guidelines. In this report, we compare the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA surveillance with imaging, measurement of CEA levels, and imaging plus measurement of CEA levels as recommended by the NCCN guidelines.

### EOD data v3.2 NAACCR 2025… [^112tLbcp]. staging.seer.cancer.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

CEA Pretreatment Interpretation DescriptionCEA Pretreatment Interpretation refers to the interpretation of the CEA value prior to treatment. CEA is a nonspecific tumor marker that has prognostic significance for colon and rectum cancer. CEA is 1). A protein molecule found in many different cells of the body but associated with certain tumors and with the developing fetus. 2). CEA is used as a tumor marker especially for gastrointestinal cancers, as colorectal cancer is the most frequent cause for an increased/elevated CEA. 3). CEA is also elevated by biliary obstruction, alcoholic hepatitis, and heavy smoking. 4). CEA level is most frequently tested on blood serum, but it may be tested in body fluids and/or biopsy tissue. 5). An abnormally high CEA level prior to tumor resection is expected to fall following successful removal of the cancer. 6). An increasing value indicates possible recurrence.

### Clinical validity of tissue carcinoembryonic antigen expression as ancillary to serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration in patients curatively resected for colorectal cancer [^113vHzCd]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Although serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is prognostic in colorectal cancer, the prognostic role of tumour CEA expression is unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic and surveillance roles of tissue CEA expression along with serum CEA concentration in patients curatively resected for colorectal cancer.

Method

Between January and December 2003, 294 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer were included in the study. Correlation of tissue CEA expression with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and elevated serum CEA concentration at tumour recurrence were analysed.

Results

Tissue CEA expression was positive in 215 patients (73.1%). CEA expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.537, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.065–6.042, P = 0.035] and DFS (HR = 3.090, 95% CI = 1.405–6.795, P = 0.005). Elevation of serum CEA at tumour recurrence was significantly lower in patients without than with tissue CEA expression (14.3 vs 57.6%, P = 0.045). Moreover, when patients were grouped according to a combination of serum CEA elevation and tissue CEA expression, those with tissue CEA expression and elevated serum CEA (group 3) had significantly poorer OS and DFS (P < 0.001 each) than those without CEA expression and elevated serum CEA (group 1) and those with either tissue CEA expression or elevated serum CEA (group 2). OS (P = 0.006) and DFS (P = 0.027) were both significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2.

Conclusion

Tissue CEA expression is a prognostic factor in patients with colorectal cancer. Analysis of tissue CEA expression may be helpful in determining the clinical utility of serial measurements of serum CEA as surveillance in patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer.

### Does serum CA19–9 play a practical role in the management of patients with colorectal cancer? [^111mEt6h]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

CA19–9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19–9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19–9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen.

Methods

A retrospective investigation was done for a consecutive series of 155 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery between 1995 and 1999. Excluded were patients with postoperative assays performed less than three times for either carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19–9 and those who had developed secondary cancers. Data from 118 patients were analyzed in terms of prediction of prognosis and detection of recurrences.

Results

The sensitivities of preoperative CA19–9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were 29.8 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively. In the univariate analysis of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19–9 assays in 114 patients, high carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.0090) by log-rank test). We could not find a significant association between preoperative CA19–9 abnormality and survival (P = 0.12). Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors indicated significance in TNM stage (P = 0.0094) and tumor location (P = 0.036) but in neither carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.061) nor CA19–9 (P = 0.22). Among 40 patients with recurrences, postoperative elevations of tumor markers were seen in 19 cases for CA19–9 and in 37 for carcinoembryonic antigen throughout the follow-up periods. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.48, 0.88, 0.68, and 0.77, respectively, for CA19–9, and 0.93, 0.88, 0.80, and 0.96, respectively, for carcinoembryonic antigen. In patients with recurrences, the initial postoperative elevation of tumor markers was seen earlier than the detection of recurrence in 68.4 percent of those with CA19–9 elevation and in 67.6 percent of those with carcinoembryonic antigen elevation. There was only one patient with recurrence who had CA19–9 elevation without carcinoembryonic antigen elevation, while 19 recurrent patients had carcinoembryonic antigen elevation without CA19–9 elevation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant risk of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation against recurrence with an odds ratio of 32.0 (P < 0.0001), in contrast to an insignificant association of CA19–9 elevation (P = 0.23).

Conclusion

We could not find clinical significance to support the use of CA19–9 to predict the prognosis and detect recurrence of colorectal cancer. Because of this, we do not recommend routine use of CA19–9 in staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer patients.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116gSEUt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — PET/CT for elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with negative, good-quality CT scans: Panel opinion was divided on the usefulness of PET/CT in this scenario. A systematic review and meta-analysis found 11 studies (510 patients), with pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting tumor recurrence of 94.1% (95% CI, 89.4–97.1) and 77.2% (95% CI, 66.4–85.9), respectively; an analysis of 88 patients under surveillance with elevated CEA and normal or equivocal conventional imaging reported PET/CT sensitivity 88% and specificity 88% for detecting recurrences. Use of PET/CT scans in this scenario is permissible within these guidelines, and the Panel does not recommend a so-called blind or CEA-directed laparotomy or laparoscopy when the workup for an increased CEA level is negative, nor does it recommend use of anti-CEA-radiolabeled scintigraphy.

### Adherence to surveillance guidelines after curative resection for stage II / III colorectal cancer [^1165sXN2]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our aims were to determine adherence to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines on colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance and to evaluate differences in practice patterns and clinical outcomes between an academic institution (Princess Margaret Hospital [PMH]) and a community cancer hospital (Credit Valley Hospital [CVH]).

Patients and Methods

Patients with stage II/III CRC who were diagnosed between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001, were identified, and their records were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

A total of 244 and 97 patients were eligible at PMH and CVH, respectively. Surveillance patterns, including blood tests, imaging studies, and colonoscopies, were inconsistent with ASCO recommendations in a significant proportion of patients. Clinic visits occurred more frequently and imaging studies were more commonly ordered at PMH than at CVH (P < .001). In contrast, CVH performed a higher median number of blood count and liver function tests (P = .001) per patient than PMH. The rates of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring and surveillance colonoscopies were not statistically different between centers (P = .67 and P = .43, respectively). There were a total of 70 CRC recurrences: 53 (75.7%) were detected by surveillance (44 at PMH and 9 at CVH) and 17 (24.3%) by patient symptoms (9 at PMH and 8 at CVH). For recurrences detected by surveillance, 38% were resectable, whereas only 18% of those detected by symptoms were resectable.

Conclusion

Colorectal cancer surveillance revealed noticeable departures from ASCO guidelines, with the academic institution using a more intensive surveillance strategy with imaging studies than the community cancer center. Surveillance was associated with a higher proportion of resectable tumor recurrences than was detection by patient symptoms.

### A general cutoff level combined with personalized dynamic change of serum carcinoembryonic antigen can suggest timely use of FDG PET for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer [^1114uqmn]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

FDG PET that has been used is good for diagnosing asymptomatic colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence in patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. However, there is no reference level of CEA rise that would universally suggest the necessity of a PET study. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the high-risk group of CRC recurrence through an examination of the dynamics of the CEA level rise as a recurrence indicator.

Patients and Methods

Between July 2002 and May 2010, 112 patients (59 men, 53 women; age, 18–87 years) had FDG PET for suspicious CRC recurrence indicated by elevated CEA level. We reviewed the PET results and the medical records for recurrence verification and calculated the ratio of increase and the velocity of change in CEA levels for risk stratification.

Results

The patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET are 96.6%, 91.3%, and 95.5%, respectively. The probability of recurrence positively correlated with the CEA level rise and the newly diagnosed disease stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 13 ng/mL indicated significantly higher risks of recurrence. In patients with CEA level rise of 13 ng/mL or less, an increase over 3.34 times the individualized baseline also indicated high risks of recurrence.

Conclusions

A posttreatment CEA level rise to greater than 13 ng/mL is suggestive of the optimal use of FDG PET, and so is a mild increase below 13 ng/mL at an increase rate over 3.34.

### Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection: recommendations of the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111uFTN1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) postoperative surveillance — Epidemiology and rationale are outlined: In the United States, CRC is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women combined; of the estimated 132,700 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2015, 70%–80% will undergo surgical resection with curative intent and up to 40% of patients with locoregional disease will develop recurrent cancer, of which 90% will occur within 5 years. The postoperative surveillance of patients treated for CRC is intended to prolong survival by diagnosing recurrent and metachronous cancers at a curable stage, and to prevent metachronous cancer by detection and removal of precancerous polyps. Surveillance strategies employ a combination of modalities, including history and physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and endoscopic evaluation, including colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and CT colonography (CTC).

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in medullary thyroid carcinoma — CEA is not a specific biomarker and measurement is not useful in the early diagnosis of MTC, but determination of serum CEA levels is useful for evaluating disease progression in patients with clinically evident MTC and for monitoring patients following thyroidectomy. In patients with MTC, simultaneous elevations of serum CEA and Cn indicate disease progression, and some patients with progressive disease have increasing CEA with stable or declining Cn; rarely, patients with advanced MTC have normal or low serum levels of both markers, including seven (0.83%) of 839 sporadic MTC patients, with prognosis ranging from intermediate-term survival (12.5 years) to death within 1.75 years after diagnosis.

### Prognostic value of the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level in colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis [^111jbo5F]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the commonly used preoperative biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), but no meta-analysis has evaluated the findings of all recently published studies to determine whether its postoperative level can serve as a prognostic indicator.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search for eligible literature from the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases in October 2023. Studies that investigated the relationship between postoperative serum CEA levels and prognosis in CRC patients were included. Outcome indicators, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS), were analyzed using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effective values.

Results

This meta-analysis included 20 eligible studies involving 10,114 CRC patients from the East Asian and Western countries. A comprehensive analysis revealed that elevated postoperative CEA levels were associated with low OS (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.36–3.62, and p < 0.000), DFS (HR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.01–3.94, and p < 0.000), and RFS/PFS (HR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.75–3.62, p < 0.000). A subgroup analysis by region, analysis type, distant metastasis, HR obtain method, sample size, postoperative measurement date, and study design demonstrated that the negative correlation observed between high serum CEA levels after surgery and poor prognosis was not significantly different between the subgroups.

Conclusion

When CEA levels are found to be elevated during postoperative follow-up, more active intervention measures should be implemented to further improve the patient's survival outcomes.

### Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection: recommendations of the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^114S5PGC]. Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer (CRC) resection — epidemiology and surveillance purpose are outlined: In the United States, CRC is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women combined, with an estimated 132,700 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2015; among these, 70–80% will undergo surgical resection with curative intent, and up to 40% of patients with locoregional disease will develop recurrent cancer, of which 90% will occur within 5 years. Postoperative surveillance is intended to improve survival by diagnosing recurrent and metachronous cancers at a curable stage and to prevent metachronous cancer by detection and removal of precancerous polyps, using modalities including history and physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and endoluminal imaging such as colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and CT colonography (CTC); the role of colonoscopy is primarily to clear the colon of synchronous cancers and polyps and prevent metachronous neoplasms.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^1123F6Rn]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The third main result of this study is the independent predictive value of postsurgery CEA levels. In our multivariate analysis the postoperative level of CEA replaced that of postoperative CA19–9 as the major determinant (with a statistically relevant weight for relative survival), although the two had apparently similar prognostic roles at univariate analysis. In most of the previous studies aimed at evaluating the implications of CEA levels for staging and prognosis, the serum concentration of CEA was evaluated preoperatively and, despite some conflicting results, the majority of them showed a direct prognostic value (a nice review on this topic is available in a recent paper by). Since the CEA level seems to roughly reflect the tumour burden and/or diffusion, its preoperative evaluation might offer a crude estimate of neoplastic spread and, thus, of the probable difficulty of achieving successful radical resection. A drop in CEA levels after the resection is considered a favourable indicator of the completeness of the surgical excision, although CEA concentration is generally regarded as more sensitive for hepatic and retroperitoneal metastases than for local recurrence or peritoneal and pulmonary metastases. According to, the measurement of the CEA level in the blood intraoperatively taken from the mesenteric vein offers some advantage, as both indicator of hepatic metastases and predictor of 5-year survival. The same investigators also found a higher recurrence rate in patients with both high CEA levels and positive citology in peritoneal washings taken at the beginning of surgery. Several patients in the present series were referred to our unit from a neighbouring hospital with preoperative CEA often not technically comparable or even not assessed. However, we know that apart from cases with documented distant metastases (stage IV), some patients have CEA levels higher than normal after putatively radical operations, without any instrumental macroscopic evidence of persisting local residual disease or distant spread. Since the half-life of CEA serum level has been calculated to be a few days – from 3.0 to 4.3 or 6.2 – our evaluation at a mean interval of 42 days after surgery – and rarely after less than 4 weeks – seems able to reliably reflect the presence of occult spread of the disease. In such cases, the clinical problem is whether to plan adjuvant therapy according to the TNM stage only or whether to consider also the altered marker value as an important worsening factor.

### ASCO 2006 update of recommendations for the use of tumor markers in gastrointestinal cancer [^114ZaXS5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the recommendations for the use of tumor marker tests in the prevention, screening, treatment, and surveillance of gastrointestinal cancers.

Methods

For the 2006 update, an update committee composed of members from the full Panel was formed to complete the review and analysis of data published since 1999. Computerized literature searches of Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The Update Committee's literature review focused attention on available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published tumor marker studies.

Recommendations and Conclusion

For colorectal cancer, it is recommended that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) be ordered preoperatively, if it would assist in staging and surgical planning. Postoperative CEA levels should be performed every 3 months for stage II and III disease for at least 3 years if the patient is a potential candidate for surgery or chemotherapy of metastatic disease. CEA is the marker of choice for monitoring the response of metastatic disease to systemic therapy. Data are insufficient to recommend the routine use of p53, ras, thymidine synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, thymidine phosphorylase, microsatellite instability, 18q loss of heterozygosity, or deleted in colon cancer (DCC) protein in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. For pancreatic cancer, CA 19–9 can be measured every 1 to 3 months for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease receiving active therapy. Elevations in serial CA 19–9 determinations suggest progressive disease but confirmation with other studies should be sought. New markers and new evidence to support the use of the currently reviewed markers will be evaluated in future updates of these guidelines.

### The value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography in asymptomatic examinees with unexplained elevated blood carcinoembryonic antigen levels [^112g2kPe]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cancer is still a clinical challenge, with many efforts invested in order to achieve timely detection. Unexplained elevated blood carcinoembryonic antigen levels are occasionally observed in an asymptomatic population and considered as a risk factor of cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG-PET/CT) for detecting cancer in an asymptomatic population with an unexplained elevation in blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels.

Methods

This retrospective study included a total of 1920 asymptomatic examinees conducted from August 2011 through September 2013. The participants underwent CEA assay and conventional medical imaging (CEA-conventional), or CEA assay and F-18 FDG-PET/CT (CEA-PET/CT). The validity of conventional medical imaging and CEA-PET/CT scanning for detecting cancer and early-stage cancer in an asymptomatic population with an unexplained elevation in blood CEA levels were evaluated.

Results

Sensitivity, specificity, cancer detection rate, missed cancer detection rate, early-stage cancer detection rate, and early-stage cancer ratio using the CEA-PET/CT scanning were 96.6%, 100%, 10.4%, 0.4%, 3.7%, and 34.5%, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding values obtained using the conventional medical imaging were 50.6% (P < 0.0001), 100% (P > 0.9999), 50.6% (P < 0.0001), 99.9% (P = 0.055), 2.6% (P < 0.0001), 2.5% (P = 0.04), 0.7% (P = 0.0004), and 14.5% (P = 0.002), respectively.

Conclusion

The F-18 FDG-PET/CT scanning significantly improved the validity of the cancer detection program in the asymptomatic population with an unexplained elevation in CEA levels.

### New insights into the role of age and carcinoembryonic antigen in the prognosis of colorectal cancer [^115VvXoM]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical importance of CEA is clear at whatever time it is assessed along the clinical course of patients with colorectal cancer, but the demonstration of it having a prognostic role also postoperatively would be interesting for deciding treatment strategies. Besides providing a serologic indication of how radical the resection has been, in addition to the mandatory microscopic inspections by the histopathologists – it could offer further information to guide the choice of subsequent treatment. This decisional step is becoming ever more critical given the large number of available adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with selective indications and different intensities and toxicities. Since the ultimate fate of the patients with colorectal cancer is related to three main factors (initial tumour stage, radicality of the surgical resection and effectiveness of adjuvant therapy – when necessary), the postoperative evaluation of the CEA level (after 5–6 weeks), in that it allows a reliable check of the last two factors, can be at least as important as the preoperative one. Thus, we fully agree with the proposal of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, which recommends the inclusion of CEA into the TNM classification (with the following suggested notations for any stage: CX, CEA not assessed; C0, CEA not elevated; and C1, CEA elevated). We only wonder whether the measurements of CEA for such a categorisation should be more properly performed at a suitable interval after surgery (we suggest 5–6 weeks) – instead of or in addition to before surgery.

In conclusion, our study of the relative survival in a population of patients who had undergone radical resection of colorectal cancer fully confirms the adequacy of the individual clinicopathological factors, which are the basis of the current Dukes', modified Astler–Coller and TNM staging classifications. The results presented offer a possible explanation for the conflicting reports on the prognostic role of age and, finally, show the true prognostic value – strictly related to cancer – of the CEA level, with particular emphasis on its postoperative assessment.

Surveillance for metastatic disease after curative-intent therapy: Patients who had resection of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) can undergo subsequent curative-intent resection of recurrent disease; in a retrospective analysis of 952 patients, 27% of patients with recurrent disease underwent curative-intent resection and 25% of those patients (6% of recurrences; 4% of the initial population) were free of disease for ≥ 36 months. For patients with stage IV CRC with no evidence of disease (NED) after curative-intent surgery and adjuvant treatment, the Panel recommends contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3 to 6 months in the first 2 years after adjuvant treatment (category 2B for frequency < 6 months) and then every 6 to 12 months for up to a total of 5 years; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for a total of 5 years, and use of PET/CT scans for surveillance is not recommended. An analysis of patients with resected or ablated colorectal liver metastases found that the frequency of surveillance imaging did not correlate with time to second procedure or median survival duration; those scanned once per year survived a median of 54 versus 43 months for those scanned 3 to 4 times per year (P = .08), suggesting that annual scans may be sufficient in this population.

Surgical treatment

Preoperative laboratory assessment

Background

A complete blood count is necessary to determine levels of hemoglobin. If hemoglobin is less than 8 g/100 mL increased postoperative morbidity is expected. A hemoglobin level of above 10 g/100 mL prior to surgery is desirable. This can be achieved either with blood transfusion at least 2–3 days prior to surgery or with the administration of erythropoietin and iron intravenous infusion at least two weeks preoperatively. There is evidence that blood transfusion impairs immune response of the patient to malignant process of the disease, which may translate to worse long-term oncological outcomes. For this reason, erythropoietin and iron infusion is recommended as the safest choice in oncological terms, although relative evidence is not sound and recommendation level is low. Defective clotting mechanisms should be corrected accordingly before surgery.

A baseline determination of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is necessary for the indirect detection of completeness of surgery, namely increased preoperative CEA levels should be normalized after curative surgery. Also according to a recent review, postoperative increase of serum CEA is a highly specific but insufficiently sensitive factor for the detection of local or distant recurrent colorectal cancer. A cut-off value of 2.2 ng/mL may provide the ideal balance of sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, serial serum CEA determination is highly recommended as a first-line surveillance test.

RECOMMENDATIONS

15 Hemoglobin blood level should ideally be > 10 g/100 mL and clotting mechanisms corrected if impaired prior to surgery (LOE II, SOR A) (ROVC: 97%)
16 Preoperative baseline determination of serum CEA levels is recommended as a first-line surveillance test (LOE III, SOR A) (ROVC: 95%)

Bowel preparation

Background

There is substantial evidence that mechanical bowel preparation prior to elective colectomy does not offer any advantage over surgery without bowel preparation. As a matter of fact and according to a recent meta-analysis, mechanical bowel preparation may be associated with increased rate of anastomotic leak and wound infection.

RECOMMENDATION

17 Mechanical bowel preparation is not generally indicated (LOE I, SOR A) (ROVC: 86%)

### Blood CEA levels for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer [^116ZKwC6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Testing for carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in the blood is a recommended part of follow-up to detect recurrence of colorectal cancer following primary curative treatment. There is substantial clinical variation in the cut-off level applied to trigger further investigation.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic performance of different blood CEA levels in identifying people with colorectal cancer recurrence in order to inform clinical practice.

Search Methods

We conducted all searches to January 29 2014. We applied no language limits to the searches, and translated non-English manuscripts. We searched for relevant reviews in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION and DARE databases. We searched for primary studies (including conference abstracts) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Science Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We identified ongoing studies by searching WHO ICTRP and the ASCO meeting library.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of post-resection colorectal cancer follow-up that compared CEA to a reference standard. We included studies only if we could extract 2 x 2 accuracy data. We excluded case-control studies, as the ratio of cases to controls is determined by the study design, making the data unsuitable for assessing test accuracy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (BDN, IP) assessed the quality of all articles independently, discussing any disagreements. Where we could not reach consensus, a third author (BS) acted as moderator. We assessed methodological quality against QUADAS-2 criteria. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data from all included studies as 2 x 2 tables. We conducted a bivariate meta-analysis. We used the xtmelogit command in Stata to produce the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and we also produced hierarchical summary ROC plots.

Main Results

In the 52 included studies, sensitivity ranged from 41% to 97% and specificity from 52% to 100%. In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 2.5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78% to 86%) and pooled specificity 80% (95% CI 59% to 92%). In the 23 studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 5 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 71% (95% CI 64% to 76%) and pooled specificity 88% (95% CI 84% to 92%). In the seven studies reporting the impact of applying a threshold of 10 µg/L, pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 53% to 79%) and pooled specificity 97% (95% CI 90% to 99%).

Authors' Conclusions

CEA is insufficiently sensitive to be used alone, even with a low threshold. It is therefore essential to augment CEA monitoring with another diagnostic modality in order to avoid missed cases. Trying to improve sensitivity by adopting a low threshold is a poor strategy because of the high numbers of false alarms generated. We therefore recommend monitoring for colorectal cancer recurrence with more than one diagnostic modality but applying the highest CEA cut-off assessed (10 µg/L).

### Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 plus carcinoembryonic antigen for prognosis in colorectal cancer: an observational study [^116KzPQS]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a primary prognostic marker and can detect colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence; however, it has low sensitivity. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) can be used as a supplemental tumour marker along with CEA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative CA 19–9 added to CEA helped predict long-term prognosis and whether follow-up CA 19–9 added to CEA had additional benefits in diagnosing the recurrence of CRC.

Method

We retrospectively assessed patients who underwent surgery for primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015 at Seoul National University Hospital. Data on demographics, preoperative and follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 levels, recurrence and survival were obtained and analysed with respect to tumour marker levels to ascertain their prognostic and diagnostic values.

Results

A total of 4972 and 1530 patients were included to analyse preoperative and follow-up tumour marker levels, respectively. The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 72.2% ± 0.8%, 52.5% ± 2.2%, 55.5% ± 3.2% and 32.1% ± 2.3% in the normal CEA and CA 19–9, high CEA, high CA 19–9, and high CEA and high CA 19–9 groups, respectively (all P < 0.001). Patients whose elevated CEA or CA 19–9 levels reduced to normal levels had better survival outcomes than those with postoperatively elevated levels. Elevated follow-up CA 19–9 and CEA levels were related to higher incidences of distant metastasis (CA 19–9, 14.0% vs. 23.1%, P = 0.004; CEA, 12.6% vs. 30.1%, P < 0.001) but not to local recurrence. Combined follow-up CEA and CA 19–9 increased the sensitivity for recurrence to 31.4%, with a 5% difference from the sensitivity of CEA alone. In the subgroup with high preoperative CA 19–9 levels, sensitivity increased by 18.2% overall.

Conclusion

CA 19–9 is a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker for CRC when used adjunctively with CEA and can be a supplementary marker with CEA to improve sensitivity, especially with elevated preoperative CA 19–9.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^116oaUik]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV

The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of ctDNA, imaging, and measurement of CEA levels were calculated based on the performance of each of the surveillance modalities in comparison with the confirmed recurrence as defined by the study (Table 3). Surveillance with CEA measurement appeared to perform poorly in detecting a first recurrence, with a sensitivity of only 20.0% (95% CI, 5.3%-48.6%). Circulating tumor DNA did not appear to perform numerically better than imaging, with sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), (P > .99), respectively. The specificity was the highest for ctDNA at 100% (95% CI, 87.0%-100%), which is expected because we defined any ctDNA-detected recurrence as a confirmed recurrence irrespective of subsequent imaging confirmation. The specificity of imaging was high at 96.9% (95% CI, 82.5%-99.8%), with 1 patient with low-risk stage III disease developing several suspicious lung nodules that were biopsied and confirmed to be benign (granulomatous) and therefore ruling out recurrence. When combining imaging and measurement of CEA levels, as recommended by NCCN guidelines, the combination modality had a numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in identifying a recurrence (sensitivity, 73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]; p = 0.55) and performed well on both the PPV (73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%] vs 100% [95% CI, 59.8%-100%]) and NPV (87.9% [95% CI, 70.9%-96.0%] vs 82.5% [95% CI, 66.6%-92.1%]). Our statistical analysis showed that the sensitivity of CEA surveillance was significantly worse than that of combined imaging and measurement of CEA levels (20.0% [95% CI, 5.3%-48.6%]; p = 0.01). No other statistical difference in sensitivity and specificity was observed among surveillance modalities (Table 4).

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) prognostic value after colorectal cancer resection — postoperative CEA levels ≥ 5.0 ng/mL were associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), with a median of 4.3 weeks between surgery and postoperative CEA measurement; elevated preoperative CEA predicted worse survival at a median follow-up of 35 months, and in stage II CRC a preoperative CEA level > 3.0 ng/mL was associated with reduced DFS (HR = 4.6 (95% CI, 2.0–10.4)) and reduced OS (HR = 3.9 (95% CI, 1.1–13.8)).

### Serum carcinoembryonic antigen trends for diagnosing colorectal cancer recurrence in the FACS randomized clinical trial [^113ee2Kt]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most guidelines recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection for primary colorectal cancer are followed up for 5 years with regular blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tests to trigger further investigation for recurrence. However, CEA may miss recurrences, or patients may have false alarms and undergo unnecessary investigation.

Methods

The diagnostic accuracy of trends in CEA measurements for recurrent colorectal cancer, taken as part of the FACS (Follow-up After Colorectal Surgery) trial (2003–2014), were analysed. Investigation to detect recurrence was triggered by clinical symptoms, scheduled CT or colonoscopy, or a CEA level of at least 7 μg/l above baseline. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CEA trends with single measurements. CEA trends were estimated using linear regression.

Results

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CEA trend was at least 0·820 across all 5 years of follow-up. In comparison, the AUCs for single measurements ranged from 0·623 to 0·749. Improvement was most marked at the end of the first year of follow-up, with the AUC increasing from 0·623 (95 per cent c.i. 0·509 to 0·736) to 0·880 (0·814 to 0·947). However, no individual trend threshold achieved a sensitivity above 70 per cent (30 per cent missed recurrences).

Conclusion

Interpreting trends in CEA measurements instead of single CEA test results improves diagnostic accuracy for recurrence, but not sufficiently to warrant it being used as a single surveillance strategy to trigger further investigation. In the absence of a more accurate biomarker, monitoring trends in CEA should be combined with clinical, endoscopic and imaging surveillance for improved accuracy.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^117PSNNw]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative assessment and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer — A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level should be obtained before elective surgery for colon cancer to establish a baseline value that is prognostic for recurrence and survival and to provide a reference value for use during surveillance; routine labs should include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a chemistry panel, and physical examination should include assessment for an abdominal mass or surgical scars. A multivariate analysis of more than 130,000 patients indicated that preoperative CEA is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I to III colon cancer, and patients with an elevated CEA had a 62% increase in the hazard of death compared with patients with a normal preoperative CEA, although the optimal cutoff value is not clear. In stage IV colorectal cancer, a decrease in CEA in response to treatment with chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival.

### Carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictor of pathologic response and a prognostic factor in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery [^112Pic6E]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the role of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a predictor of response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and prognostic factor for rectal cancer.

Materials and Methods

The study retrospectively evaluated 352 locally advanced rectal cancer patients who underwent preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Serum CEA levels were determined before CRT administration (pre-CRT CEA) and before surgery (post-CRT CEA). Correlations between pre-CRT CEA levels and rates of good response (Tumor regression grade 3/4) were explored. Patients were categorized into three CEA groups according to their pre-/post-CRT CEA levels (ng/mL) (Group A: pre-CRT CEA ≤ 3; B: pre-CRT CEA > 3, post-CRT CEA ≤ 3; C: pre- and post-CRT CEA > 3 ng/mL), and their oncologic outcomes were compared.

Results

Of 352 patients, good responses were achieved in 94 patients (26.7%). The rates of good response decreased significantly as the pre-CRT CEA levels became more elevated (CEA [ng/mL]: ≤ 3, 36.4%; 3–6, 23.6%; 6–9, 15.6%; > 9, 7.8%; p < 0.001). The rates of good response were significantly higher in Group A than in Groups B and C (36.4% vs. 17.3% and 14.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly better in Groups A and B than in Group C (82% and 79% vs. 57%, respectively; p = 0.005); the CEA grouping was identified as an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.025).

Conclusions

In locally advanced rectal cancer patients, CEA levels could be of clinical value as a predictor of response to preoperative CRT and as an independent prognostic factor after preoperative CRT and curative surgery.

### Follow-up and surveillance of the patient with lung cancer after curative-intent therapy: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Dc8os]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for risk-stratified surveillance after curative therapy are discussed, noting uncertainty about testing intervals and that several biomarkers predict a higher risk for recurrence. In one study, postoperative serum levels of CEA ≤ 2.5 ng/mL and absence of vascular invasion predicted no recurrence of stage I lung adenocarcinoma; using a cutoff of 2.5 ng/mL, nine of 16 cases (56%) showed disease recurrence, whereas six of 120 cases (5%) showed recurrence at levels ≤ 2.5 ng/mL, suggesting less-intense surveillance for the low-CEA group. If results are replicated in additional studies, such a strategy might be recommended for selecting patients for more-intense follow-up as well as for selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Circulating tumor DNA testing in curatively resected colorectal cancer and salvage resection [^112Ff98i]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Even if ctDNA assays can detect earlier recurrences compared with conventional imaging, limited data suggest that further intensifying surveillance and pushing for earlier detection of recurrence is directly correlated with improvements in survival. Studies done with older surveillance strategies do suggest that patients with disease recurrence picked up on routine testing are more likely to undergo successful curative-intent resection compared with those who are found to have recurrence after presenting with symptoms. Although a few studies have shown a modest survival benefit of more frequent follow-up during surveillance, several other randomized trials have failed to demonstrate that more-intensive surveillance regimens lead to a substantial survival benefit compared with less-intensive regimens. Indeed, these mixed results suggest that the clinical benefit of early detection of recurrence may plateau after a certain threshold, and further improvements to the timing of detection may not be worth the added cost of more frequent or, in the case of ctDNA assays, more novel testing.

In addition, the value of adding a blood-based marker for recurrence in combination with CT imaging has been extensively explored with the introduction of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing. CEA by itself is not highly sensitive or specific for CRC, but when measured serially in the setting of surveillance for recurrent CRC, it has been shown to detect recurrence several months before other modalities, including CT imaging alone. Although CEA has been shown to be potentially cost-effective, there remain no prospective data demonstrating that a clear survival benefit can be attributed to the addition of serial serum CEA measurements. Thus, it is difficult to justify the value of adding ctDNA assays, which are much more costly than CEA assays, to the current NCCN-recommended surveillance strategy of serial CEA testing and CT imaging. In addition, there is no definitive evidence to date that the implementation of systemic chemotherapy will have a curative outcome in patients with ctDNA recurrence and negative imaging in a surveillance setting. Hence, no treatment strategies can be recommended at this time for patients with ctDNA recurrent, imaging-negative CRC. Until novel treatment strategies are developed and validated for these patients who harbor microscopic disease, further intensifying surveillance is unlikely to translate into improvements in key clinical outcomes.

### Comparison of carcinoembryonic antigen prognostic value in serum and tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer [^114BmLSk]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumour types in the world, with about 400 000 deaths annually. In the United States, despite a slight decrease in its incidence and mortality during the past two decades, CRC remains the third most common cancer, affecting about 140 000 people and accounting for 50 000 cancer-related deaths per year. In China, where the incidence rate was initially low, due to the changes in lifestyle and nutritional habits, the CRC rate is increasing by 4.2% annually.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most commonly used tumour marker for the diagnosis of CRC and evaluation of prognosis or recurrence after treatment. The guideline of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) indicated that for T2 or greater lesions, a CEA test is recommended at baseline and every 3 months for 2 years. CEA can be detected and quantitatively measured in the serum and the tumour tissue of CRC patients, but their role in the prognosis of CRC remains controversial. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA both in tumour tissue and in serum of the patients with CRC.

### Evaluation of comparative surveillance strategies of circulating tumor DNA, imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with resected colorectal cancer [^111VwVfd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The sensitivity of personalized ctDNA assays has drawn significant interest among medical communities. Many oncologists have opted to use ctDNA in the surveillance of early-stage and resected stage IV colorectal cancer. Much of the supporting evidence comes from a prospective clinical trial that showed a strong prognostic role for ctDNA in the follow-up of stage I to III colorectal cancer in a large Danish trial. However, this study was limited by the inadequate radiographic surveillance, which may have biased the overall outcomes to support the superiority of ctDNA over imaging in monitoring for recurrence. Another studysuggested improved sensitivity of a more limited ctDNA platform over imaging, but again used infrequent imaging (yearly for 3 years) in a high-risk population.

In this study of 48 patients with stage II to IV colorectal cancer who were in a clinical remission after surgical intervention, we reported on the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA, measurement of CEA levels, imaging, or imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (eTable in the Supplement). We were not able to confirm any advantages of the ctDNA assay over imaging in detecting disease recurrence. In fact, imaging plus measurement of CEA levels identified the recurrence before ctDNA in 7 of 15 cases and concurrently with ctDNA in 4 of 15 cases. Therefore, the sensitivity of the current NCCN guidelines in identifying disease recurrence appeared numerically superior to that of ctDNA. Computed tomographic imaging was particularly more sensitive in identifying pulmonary recurrence than ctDNA, with 5 of 8 patients with lung recurrences identified by CT before ctDNA or with persistently negative ctDNA findings. None of our patients with recurrent disease had peritoneal recurrence only. Therefore, the merits of ctDNA in patients with peritoneal recurrence could not be assessed in our study. However, prior studies have reported that patients with peritoneal disease have the lowest rate of detectable ctDNA, especially when compared with patients with liver and lung disease, raising concerns regarding the dependence on ctDNA in identifying such recurrences.

### False-positive elevations of carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with a history of resected colorectal cancer [^113VCGLX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Routine monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is standard in patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC). The incidence of false-positives and the upper limits of false-positive elevations have not been previously well characterized. A search of medical records at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 728 patients who underwent an R0 resection of locoregional CRC between January 2003 and December 2012 and who had an increase in CEA level above the normal range after a normal perioperative CEA level. Of these, 358 had a false-positive elevation of CEA level, 335 had a true-positive elevation indicative of recurrent CRC, and 35 had a true-positive elevation indicative of the development of a new, non-CRC malignancy. Of those with false elevations, 111 had a single isolated CEA level elevation (median highest CEA level of 5.5 ng/mL) with no further abnormal measurements, whereas 247 had elevations on 2 or more readings, with a median highest level of 6.7 ng/mL. Of these 247 patients with confirmed false-positive CEA level elevations, only 5 (2%) had measurements greater than 15 ng/mL, and no confirmed elevation greater than 35 ng/mL was a false-positive. False-positive CEA test results in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL are common. Confirmation of CEA elevation in this range before initiating imaging studies may be appropriate. False-positive results greater than 15 ng/mL are rare, and all confirmed CEA levels greater than 35 ng/mL were associated with cancer recurrence.

### Molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of colorectal cancer: guideline from the American Society for Clinical Pathology, college of American pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology [^115oyVRr]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2017). Medium credibility.

ASCP/CAP/AMP/ASCO CRC biomarker guideline — Expert Consensus Opinion 13: Molecular and immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarker testing in colorectal carcinoma should be initiated in a timely fashion based on the clinical scenario and in accordance with institutionally accepted practices. Test ordering can occur on a case-by-case basis or by policies established by the medical staff, and delays in initiation of therapy have been associated with worse outcomes. Predictive biomarkers, such as those for EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy, should be initiated in a timely fashion to guide chemotherapy options and long-term treatment planning, and institutional policies and practices that encourage the rapid initiation of appropriate molecular and IHC marker testing should be encouraged; such policies may include reflexive ordering of molecular and IHC markers as guided by the clinical scenario and incorporation of testing initiation by multiple members of the multidisciplinary team.
