## Question

What ultrasound setting is best for patient safety?
Low transmitter output
High transmitter output
Low receiver gain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ultrasound setting — low transmitter output, high transmitter output, or low receiver gain — is best for patient safety, and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core safety principle in diagnostic ultrasound. Then, I should verify which controls directly affect acoustic output and which do not. Next, I will examine the risks associated with high transmitter output versus the safety implications of low transmitter output. After that, I need to check whether low receiver gain meaningfully changes acoustic exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation and note any exceptions or caveats that might modify practice in special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the foundational safety principle. Diagnostic ultrasound safety hinges on ALARA: As Low As Reasonably Achievable, which directs clinicians to minimize acoustic output and exposure time while preserving diagnostic quality, and this principle is explicitly embedded in AIUM practice parameters across modalities including POCUS, abdominal, head and neck, and urologic ultrasound [^111QBCAB] [^114p9DGE] [^113Y8uDh] [^113wXH4q].

> Wait, let me verify which knob actually changes the energy delivered to the patient. Transmitter output directly governs the acoustic power sent into tissue and thus the mechanical index and thermal index, the two displayed safety metrics tied to potential bioeffects; receiver gain, in contrast, amplifies returning echoes electronically and does not increase transmitted power or tissue exposure, so it does not violate ALARA when adjusted for image brightness [^117D17rh] [^111QBCAB].

> I will now examine the safety implications of high transmitter output. Increasing output raises MI and TI, which correlate with mechanical and thermal bioeffects; in lung ultrasound, for example, higher MI has been associated with pulmonary capillary hemorrhage in animal models, prompting guidance to keep MI low and limit exposure time, and in obstetrics and other sensitive applications, regulators and societies advise using the lowest output consistent with diagnostic need to mitigate theoretical risks even though human harm has not been definitively proven at diagnostic levels [^114vQVea] [^1167LB6V] [^114qWk2J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the practical consequence of choosing low transmitter output. Selecting low transmitter output aligns with ALARA by reducing MI and TI, and when image quality is suboptimal at low output, the appropriate next step is to optimize other non–output-related controls such as receiver gain, depth, focus, and transducer selection rather than reflexively increasing power, thereby maintaining diagnostic quality without excess exposure [^111QBCAB] [^114p9DGE] [^114gpM17] [^1115Hf98].

> But wait, what if someone argues that low receiver gain could indirectly improve safety by shortening scan time because images are cleaner faster? I need to check whether that's a valid mechanism. While optimizing gain can improve workflow, the causal pathway to safety is indirect and speculative compared with the direct, dose-related benefit of reducing transmitter output; moreover, receiver gain adjustments do not alter the acoustic dose metrics displayed on the screen, so they should not be framed as a primary safety control, even if they might facilitate quicker exams in practice [^111QBCAB].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing an exception. The safest primary choice is low transmitter output, applied within ALARA alongside judicious use of receiver gain and other image-optimization settings; exceptions include scenarios where diagnostic necessity compels transient higher output, such as brief high-MI "flash" frames in low-MI contrast echocardiography, but even then, best practice is to return promptly to low-output presets and minimize total exposure time, which reinforces rather than contradicts the low-output principle [^116zeVYF] [^111QBCAB].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: low transmitter output is the best ultrasound setting for patient safety because it directly reduces acoustic power and the indices associated with thermal and mechanical bioeffects, whereas low receiver gain improves image brightness without changing transmitted energy. Adhere to ALARA by using the lowest output that yields diagnostic images and compensating with gain, focus, depth, and transducer selection rather than increasing power, especially in sensitive populations and lung ultrasound where MI thresholds are emphasized [^111QBCAB] [^114p9DGE] [^114vQVea] [^1165DpiN] [^1115Hf98].

---

The safest ultrasound setting for patients is **low transmitter output** [^1115Hf98], because it minimizes acoustic energy and reduces the risk of thermal and mechanical bioeffects [^114nQ8QP] [^1115Hf98]. High transmitter output increases tissue heating and cavitation risk, especially in sensitive tissues like the eye, lung, and fetus [^1115Hf98]. Low receiver gain does not reduce acoustic exposure and is not a safety control. Always apply the **ALARA principle** [^114p9DGE] — use the lowest output that still yields diagnostic images — and keep scan time short [^1115Hf98].

---

## Acoustic output and patient safety

Ultrasound safety depends on two **bioeffects**: thermal (tissue heating) and mechanical (cavitation and microstreaming) [^117D17rh]. These risks rise with higher acoustic output and longer exposure [^114qWk2J] [^114vQVea].

---

### Thermal effects

Thermal effects arise when **tissue temperature rises**, potentially causing protein denaturation and cell damage. Risk increases with higher transmitter output and prolonged exposure [^1115Hf98]. Sensitive tissues — such as the eye, lung, and fetus — are particularly vulnerable to thermal injury [^1115Hf98] [^1167LB6V].

---

### Mechanical effects

Mechanical effects include **cavitation** (microbubble formation and collapse) and **microstreaming** (fluid motion), which can damage cell membranes and vessels [^117D17rh]. Higher transmitter output increases these risks, especially in gas-containing tissues like the lung [^114vQVea].

---

## Transmitter output settings and patient safety

Transmitter output directly controls **acoustic energy**. Lower output reduces thermal and mechanical risks; higher output increases them [^114vQVea].

---

### Low transmitter output

Low transmitter output reduces acoustic energy, lowering the risk of thermal and mechanical effects [^114qWk2J]. It is especially important in sensitive tissues — such as the eye, lung, and fetus — and aligns with **ALARA** [^1115Hf98] [^1167LB6V].

---

### High transmitter output

High transmitter output increases acoustic energy, raising the risk of thermal and mechanical effects [^114nQ8QP]. It should be avoided unless absolutely necessary to obtain diagnostic images, and even then, **use the minimum effective output**.

---

## Receiver gain settings and patient safety

Receiver gain amplifies returning echoes and **does not change transmitted acoustic energy** or tissue exposure; thus, it is not a safety control and has no meaningful effect on thermal or mechanical risk [^114gpM17].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Professional societies emphasize **ALARA** and **prudent use** to minimize risk:

- **ALARA principle**: Use the lowest output and shortest scan time consistent with diagnostic quality [^114p9DGE] [^111QBCAB].
- **Prudent use**: Minimize exposure, especially in sensitive tissues and during prolonged exams [^1115Hf98] [^113wXH4q].
- **Manufacturer guidelines**: Stay within recommended output limits and monitor thermal (TI) and mechanical (MI) indices [^114nQ8QP].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Recommended setting** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Transmitter output | Low | Reduces thermal and mechanical risks [^1115Hf98] |
| Receiver gain | Adjust as needed | Does not affect acoustic exposure [^notfound] |
| Scan time | Short | Reduces cumulative exposure [^114p9DGE] |
| ALARA principle | Apply | Ensures minimal exposure [^111QBCAB] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Low transmitter output is the safest setting because it **minimizes acoustic energy** and the risks of thermal and mechanical effects [^114qWk2J]. High transmitter output should be avoided unless necessary, and low receiver gain does not improve safety. Always apply **ALARA** — use the lowest output and shortest scan time that still yields diagnostic images — especially in sensitive tissues [^114p9DGE].

### Improving the safety of thoracentesis [^116qdGDF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracentesis is a common bedside procedure associated with iatrogenic complications including pneumothorax. Experienced clinicians using optimal procedural techniques within a supportive system can achieve improvements in safety. However, clinicians have been relatively slow to adopt these changes. This review examines the available literature regarding procedural safety of thoracentesis with emphasis on best practice models to reduce iatrogenic complications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have identified procedure-specific variables that are independently associated with iatrogenic pneumothorax including inexperienced operators, lack of ultrasound imaging, and large-volume aspiration of fluid. Development of a best practice model including procedural training within a focused procedural group that utilizes ultrasound imaging further improves thoracentesis procedural safety.

Summary

Several procedural modifications have led to improvements in thoracentesis procedural safety in reducing iatrogenic complications. Herein, we review the known risks associated with thoracentesis and identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. On the basis of recent studies, we make recommendations and encourage incorporation of 'best practice' techniques for thoracentesis procedures.

### Overview of therapeutic ultrasound applications and safety considerations [^111BnP3N]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Applications of ultrasound in medicine for therapeutic purposes have been accepted and beneficial uses of ultrasonic biological effects for many years. Low-power ultrasound of about 1 MHz has been widely applied since the 1950s for physical therapy in conditions such as tendinitis and bursitis. In the 1980s, high-pressure-amplitude shock waves came into use for mechanically resolving kidney stones, and "lithotripsy" rapidly replaced surgery as the most frequent treatment choice. The use of ultrasonic energy for therapy continues to expand, and approved applications now include uterine fibroid ablation, cataract removal (phacoemulsification), surgical tissue cutting and hemostasis, transdermal drug delivery, and bone fracture healing, among others. Undesirable bioeffects can occur, including burns from thermal-based therapies and severe hemorrhage from mechanical-based therapies (eg, lithotripsy). In all of these therapeutic applications of ultrasound bioeffects, standardization, ultrasound dosimetry, benefits assurance, and side-effect risk minimization must be carefully considered to ensure an optimal benefit to risk ratio for the patient. Therapeutic ultrasound typically has well-defined benefits and risks and therefore presents a manageable safety problem to the clinician. However, safety information can be scattered, confusing, or subject to commercial conflicts of interest. Of paramount importance for managing this problem is the communication of practical safety information by authoritative groups, such as the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, to the medical ultrasound community. In this overview, the Bioeffects Committee of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine outlines the wide range of therapeutic ultrasound methods, which are in clinical use or under study, and provides general guidance for ensuring therapeutic ultrasound safety.

### Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116VcZcd]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Education, justification, and optimization are the cornerstones to enhancing the radiation safety of medical imaging. Education regarding the benefits and risks of imaging and the principles of radiation safety is required for all clinicians in order for them to be able to use imaging optimally. Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of imaging will facilitate their meaningful participation in decisions related to their health care, which is necessary to achieve patient-centered care. Limiting the use of imaging to appropriate clinical indications can ensure that the benefits of imaging outweigh any potential risks. Finally, the continually expanding repertoire of techniques that allow high-quality imaging with lower radiation exposure should be used when available to achieve safer imaging. The implementation of these strategies in practice is necessary to achieve high-quality, patient-centered imaging and will require a shared effort and investment by all stakeholders, including physicians, patients, national scientific and educational organizations, politicians, and industry.

### Potential adverse ultrasound-related biological effects: a critical review [^114kXN7c]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Ultrasound energy exerts important cellular, genetic, thermal, and mechanical effects. Concern about the safety of ultrasound prompted several agencies to devise regulatory limits on the machine output intensities. The visual display of thermal and mechanical indices during ultrasound imaging provides an aid to limit the output of the machine. Despite many animal studies, no human investigations conducted to date have documented major physiologic consequences of ultrasound exposed during imaging. To date, ultrasound imaging appears to be safe for use in regional anesthesia and pain medicine interventions, and adherence to limiting the output of ultrasound machines as outlined by the Food and Drug Administration may avoid complications in the future. This article reviews ultrasound-related biologic effects, the role of the regulatory agencies in ensuring safety with the use of ultrasound, and the limitations and implications of ultrasound use in humans.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^113e8giT]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

General specifications — facility and personnel — The procedure should be performed in a facility with adequate space and the necessary supplies and personnel, and examples of appropriate facilities include a medical office, surgical center, or hospital. Most procedures are considered low risk and may be performed as point-of-care procedures in an office or surgical center setting, and for higher-risk procedures it would be appropriate to perform them in a location that has the ability to respond to a medical emergency.

### Imaging-based screening: maximizing benefits and minimizing harms [^111QAGDw]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Advanced imaging technologies play a central role in screening asymptomatic patients. However, the balance between imaging-based screening's potential benefits versus risks is sometimes unclear. Radiologists will have to address ongoing concerns, including high false-positive rates, incidental findings outside the organ of interest, overdiagnosis, and potential risks from radiation exposure. In this article, we provide a brief overview of these recurring controversies and suggest the following as areas that radiologists should focus on in order to tip the balance toward more benefits and less harms for patients undergoing imaging-based screening: interpretive variability, abnormal finding thresholds, and personalized, risk-based screening.

### Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116bUCst]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Optimization — cardiac imaging with ionizing radiation emphasizes that once a cardiac imaging study is deemed appropriate and clinically necessary, the study should be performed in a manner that minimizes radiation exposure while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy, and patients should be exposed to the amount of radiation necessary to produce images adequate for the clinical purpose, but not substantially more or less. Justification is highlighted, as a determination of the appropriateness of imaging is the first, cardinal step, and even if cardiac imaging with ionizing radiation is appropriate, there may be comparable diagnostic tests without radiation, and in some patients, this may be the preferred approach, especially in younger patients in whom the projected lifetime attributable risk of radiogenic cancer is higher. Appropriate use criteria (AUC) can only serve as a tool for promoting appropriate use and limiting inappropriate use of procedures if they are meaningfully integrated into clinical decision making.

Hygiene and infection prevention

In every clinical setting, particularly with high patient turnover and a large clinical team involved, it is important to establish and implement strict local hygiene and decontamination protocols. Standards need to be maintained to ensure patient safety for all ultrasound examinations and ultrasound guided interventions. Evidence of such protocols may need to be produced in litigation cases.

Contamination of ultrasound transducers is undeniably omnipresent. The risk of cross infection secondary to ultrasound equipment has never been assessed by systematic research and the estimated actual risk is debated. Only a very limited number of adverse events have been published, but this should not be reassuring

National guidance and legislation regulating decontamination procedures vary throughout Europe. The European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee (former ultrasound working group) found a great variance of practice throughout Europe and as a result has attempted to offer best practice recommendations to aspire to, which are briefly summarised below.

Hygiene and decontamination protocols should be adapted to the local environment and clinical setting. They must include rules on hand hygiene (hands still being the primary source of infection transmission), decontamination of all parts of ultrasound machines, regular deep cleaning of the entire ultrasound room surfaces, as well as appropriate sharps and other waste disposal.

With the increasing use of smart phones by all members of staff, and marketing of the new "smart" ultrasound transducers that can be plugged into "phones", no longer needing an independent ultrasound machine, it is essential to include decontamination of mobile phones or guidance on use restriction. Publications confirm worrying levels of phone contamination. According to Martina et al. > 99% of touchscreens showed partly multi-resistant bacteria and Simmonds et al. documented that despite high levels of contamination and staff awareness, only a minority (13%) disinfects their phones regularly.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^114vQVea]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Future Developments

Detailed and extensive studies are needed to define an international consensus on the safety limits for LUS in patients.

As shown in animal model research, LUS in the diagnostic regime can affect the alveolar epithelium–gas interface. Therefore, a potential exists for microvascular PCH injury with clinical LUS and for confounding of LUS diagnosis by introduction of extraneous occurrence of the B‐line sign. The clinical significance in humans remains uncertain, because it has not been investigated on a pathological level as in animal studies. Therefore, the application of mitigating guidance based on animal models is prudently recommended during human LUS.

Clinician and LUS providers should be aware that LUS is not absolutely without risk of harm from the diagnostic US exposure. The high diagnostic value of a non‐ionizing sonographic lung imaging modality correctly applied in clinical practice provides substantial patient benefit. However, non‐clinical research in animal models has demonstrated that LUS in the diagnostic regime can induce pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH). The likelihood and magnitude of this bioeffect, above an acoustic output threshold dependent on the specific details of the case, increases with increasing exposure duration and output indicated by the MI, or output power (pDoppler, SWE). There is negligible risk of PCH for outputs below a worst‐case threshold of MI = 0.4. The sonography induced PCH was shown to be limited to subpleural tissue to a maximum depth of a few mm and is related to the size of the transducer. Any diagnostic LUS induced PCH is expected to be asymptomatic, does not represent alveolar rupture and does not require interventions. Diagnostic concerns arise due to the fact that PCH can mimic LUS signs (B lines and white lung) and therefore may influence the diagnostic outcome.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound: what is the evidence and what are the obstacles? [^116XCwu3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Although ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are popular and widely used in Europe and Asia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved a microbubble agent for radiology imaging in the United States. Herein, we discuss the evidence for and the obstacles to using UCAs for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).

Conclusion

Despite the obstacles to the use of UCAs for CEUS including regulatory and practice patterns, the evidence indicates that radiologists and patients will be missing an effectual imaging option if we do not encourage the use of CEUS and strongly support the approval of UCAs by the FDA. The evidence outweighs the obstacles: CEUS is cost-effective; can be performed at the bedside; uses no ionizing radiation; has no nephrotoxicity; and, most importantly, can provide accurate diagnostic information comparable to CT and MRI.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^111QBCAB]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

AIUM practice parameter — quality control and ALARA for point-of-care ultrasound state that policies and procedures related to quality control, patient education, infection control, and safety, including equipment performance monitoring, should be developed and implemented in accordance with the AIUM Standards and Guidelines for the Accreditation of Ultrasound Practices. The potential benefits and risks of each examination should be considered, and the ALARA principle should be observed when adjusting controls that affect the acoustic output and by considering transducer dwell times.

### AIUM practice parameter for the use of ultrasound to guide vascular access procedures [^115yWKby]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) ultrasound guidance — PICC use is typically appropriate when intravenous therapy will exceed 14 days, but PICCs should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease to preserve future dialysis access. PICCs are frequently placed by nurses, with approximately 70% of the 3 million PICCs placed annually in the United States by nurses, and the availability of ultrasound equipment and appropriate training for nurses who perform PICC placement is recommended. The use of ultrasound guidance for PICC placement enhances vein assessment, provides a better selection of optimal veins for access, enhances success while decreasing complications, and has been shown to substantially increase overall success rates while minimizing the risk of thrombosis; based on this evidence and evolving best practices, it is the recommendation of this group that ultrasound equipment and training should be provided to practitioners who place PICCs and that ultrasound guidance should be used routinely to aid in PICC placement.

### Cost-effectiveness of a precision hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance strategy in patients with cirrhosis [^113pURSL]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we note that risk-stratified and precision surveillance strategies can miss early-stage HCC in low-risk patients compared to universal ultrasound plus AFP. Although this shortcoming is offset by increased early-stage detection in intermediate- and high-risk subgroups, these data highlight a need for improved risk stratification in the future. Although providers are generally accepting of risk-based surveillance strategies, large numbers of missed cancers may reduce adoption of a no-surveillance strategy in low-risk patients.

There are several strengths and limitations of this manuscript that warrant further attention. One limitation is that our model assumes stable HCC risk over time, but HCC risk can be dynamic as patients age and patients could transition to a higher or lower risk state with aging or disease modifying interventions such as treatment of viral hepatitis, weight loss, or alcohol cessation. Similarly, the optimal surveillance strategy for an individual patient may also change over time. Second, as noted, some surveillance methods (i.e. abbreviated MRI and GALAD) have emerging data on test performance in a surveillance setting and the estimates used for this analysis may not reflect real world performance. Third, we developed the precision surveillance strategy based on preferred strategies for each patient profile, although a more cost-effective overall combination may be possible in the future. Fourth, our precision surveillance strategy included ∼50 different patient profiles, although a more nuanced precision surveillance strategy may be possible by differentiating factors further (e.g. ALD vs. MASLD). However, optimizing performance of a surveillance strategy must be balanced with feasibility of implementation in clinical practice. Although decision support tools in the electronic medical record would have minimal impact on costs, other interventions for implementation and adherence could impact cost-effectiveness of the precision surveillance strategy. Finally, there are several emerging modalities for HCC surveillance, e.g. cell free DNA methods; however, these strategies are in early-phase validation and thus not included. These limitations are outweighed by the strengths of the novelty of our analysis, nuanced modeling methodology, and high clinical implications of our findings.

In conclusion, we showed that a precision surveillance strategy is the most cost-effective method for HCC surveillance. This approach could maximize surveillance benefits, while minimizing harms associated with surveillance, although further studies evaluating the impact on downstream outcomes would be necessary. While implementation of such a surveillance paradigm may be challenging, there could be marked improvements of the effectiveness of existing HCC surveillance programs.

### Best practice recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound in patients with suspected COVID-19 [^115U7ZWQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a critical tool for evaluating patients with dyspnea in the emergency department (ED), including patients with suspected coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. However, given the threat of nosocomial disease spread, the use of ultrasound is no longer risk free.

Objective

Here, we review the lung POCUS findings in patients with COVID-19. In doing so we present a scanning protocol for lung POCUS in COVID-19 that maximizes clinical utility and provider safety.

Discussion

In COVID-19 lung, POCUS findings are predominantly located in the posterior and lateral lung zones bilaterally. A six-zone scanning protocol that prioritizes obtaining images in these locations optimizes provider positioning, and minimizes time spent scanning, which can reduce risk to health care workers performing POCUS.

Conclusions

Lung POCUS can offer valuable clinical data when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Scanning protocols such as that presented here, which target clinical utility and decreased nosocomial disease spread, must be prioritized.

### Benefits and risks of ultrasound in pregnancy [^113CEDK4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is, arguably, the most commonly used diagnostic procedure in obstetrics. It is convenient, painless, yields immediate, extensive results, and is widely considered to be safe. Some (but not all) benefits described in the literature have been validated by evidence-based analysis, such as pregnancy dating. Others are considered clinically useful, although objective evidence may be less strong. As is the case with almost any medical procedure, however, its performance carries some risks: misdiagnosis on the one hand and possible undesired effects on the other. The general belief exists that diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) does not pose any risk to the pregnant patient nor to her fetus. Nonetheless, ultrasound is a form of energy and, as such, demonstrates effects in biological tissues it traverses (bioeffects). The physical mechanisms responsible for these effects are thermal or non-thermal (mechanical). It is the role of science to show whether any of these bioeffects may be harmful. A risk-benefit analysis may also be important, as well as education of the end users to assure patients' safety.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^115Zrtzm]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Viral phone contamination is more difficult to evaluate but studies also prove a contamination risk with viral pathogens. Pillet demonstrated viral contamination of almost 40% of examined mobile phones, predominantly from staff on paediatric wards. Pathogens can survive a long time on inert surfaces, resulting in touch screens and other surfaces becoming a source of infection transmission for a prolonged period of time.

Summarised infection prevention recommendations include:
Practitioner's hands and ultrasound transducers used must be cleaned and disinfected before the first and after every subsequent patient contact. Should ultrasound gel or other dirt remain on the transducers, any disinfection agent is unable to penetrate and decontamination is incomplete; viable pathogens can persist in these circumstances.
It is no longer acceptable to simply wipe off ultrasound gel between patients; practitioners cannot determine which "normal" microscopic flora patients may carry, which may pose a threat to the subsequent patient or which more virulent pathogens may be present on the patient's skin. Accurate risk assessment of patients is difficult.
Ultrasound transducer cables and keyboards/touchscreens of ultrasound machines (as well as all other clinical surfaces) should be very regularly fully decontaminated.
Ultrasound gel bottles should not be kept open and upside down, in particular not in ultrasound bottle warmers. Pathogens may be present once the tip accidently touches the patient or other surfaces, and warmers may act as incubators. Single use bottles are preferable to refillable bottles.
Should routine patients present with wounds or other skin pathology (any non-intact skin surface), ultrasound transducer covers are to be used with sterile gel inside and outside the cover as sheath micro-perforations cannot be excluded. This reduces potential infection transmission to the patient scanned as well as reducing transducer contamination, facilitating successful disinfection. Evidently, all ultrasound transducers need to be fully decontaminated after every patient contact, whether or not a transducer cover is used, due to micro-perforations and because of high contamination rates during cover removal.
Low risk setting: After a routine ultrasound examination on intact skin, ultrasound transducer cleaning with subsequent low-level disinfection is sufficient.
Intermediate to high risk setting: Following endo-cavity ultrasound examinations as well as after any interventional procedures (including ultrasound guided injections), high level disinfection is mandatory.
All biopsy needles should be strictly single-use and re-usable needle guides should be avoided, as the thin bore is often not fully decontaminated.
Single-use dedicated certified transducer covers must be used for endo-cavity ultrasound and all interventions.
Sterile gel inside and outside transducer covers should be used for endo-cavity examinations and all interventions.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^1164onhm]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided procedures — infection control and postprocedure care specify that in the setting of suspected infection, the performing clinician should choose a needle path that avoids or minimizes contamination risk, and if there is any question of infection, fluid should be sent for analysis and/or culture because the ultrasound appearance of fluid is an unreliable indicator of infection. After completing the procedure, the needle or catheter should be withdrawn from the patient's skin and dressings applied based on the procedure, and postprocedure instructions should be reviewed with the patient. Any drains left in place should be managed in accordance with facility guidelines.

### Diagnostic ultrasound safety review for point-of-care ultrasound practitioners [^1115Hf98]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential ultrasound exposure safety issues are reviewed, with guidance for prudent use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Safety assurance begins with the training of POCUS practitioners in the generation and interpretation of diagnostically valid and clinically relevant images. Sonographers themselves should minimize patient exposure in accordance with the as-low-as-reasonably-achievable principle, particularly for the safety of the eye, lung, and fetus. This practice entails the reduction of output indices or the exposure duration, consistent with the acquisition of diagnostically definitive images. Informed adoption of POCUS worldwide promises a reduction of ionizing radiation risks, enhanced cost-effectiveness, and prompt diagnoses for optimal patient care.

### Current clinical investigations of focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier disruption: a review [^116zRmC1]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a formidable challenge in delivering therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Ultrasound-mediated BBB disruption has emerged as a promising non-invasive technique to enhance drug delivery to the brain. This manuscript reviews fundamental principles of ultrasound-based techniques and their mechanisms of action in temporarily permeabilizing the BBB. Clinical trials employing ultrasound for BBB disruption are discussed, summarizing diverse applications ranging from the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases to targeted drug delivery for brain tumors. The review also addresses safety considerations, outlining the current understanding of potential risks and mitigation strategies associated with ultrasound exposure, including real-time monitoring and assessment of treatment efficacy. Among the large number of studies, significant successes are highlighted thus providing perspective on the future direction of the field.

### The optimal rebiopsy prostatic scheme depends on patient clinical characteristics: results of a recursive partitioning analysis based on a 24-core systematic scheme [^113TFNS3]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The most beneficial number and the location of prostate biopsies remain matters of debate, especially after an initial negative biopsy.

Objective

To identify the optimal combination of sampling sites (number and location) to detect prostate cancer (PCa) in patients previously submitted to an initial negative prostatic biopsy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic 24-core prostate biopsy (24PBx) was performed prospectively in 340 consecutive patients after a first negative biopsy (at least 12 cores).

Measurements

We relied on a classification and regression tree analysis to identify three clinically different subgroups of patients at dissimilar risk of harboring PCa at second biopsy. Subsequently, we set the cancer-positive rate of the 24PBx at 100% and calculated PCa detection rates for 255 possible combinations of sampling sites. We selected the optimal biopsy scheme (defined as the combination of sampling sites that detected 95% of all the cancers with the minimal number of biopsy cores) for each patient subgroup.

Results and Limitations

After an initial negative biopsy, cancer was detected at rebiopsy in 95 men (27.9%). At a given number of cores, the cancer detection rates varied significantly according to the different combination of sites considered. Three different PCa risk groups were identified: (1) previous report of atypical small acinar proliferation of the prostate (ASAP), (2) no previous ASAP and ratio of free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA) to total PSA (%fPSA) ≤ 10%, and (3) no previous ASAP and %fPSA > 10%. For patients with previous ASAP or patients with no previous ASAP and %fPSA ≤ 10%, two schemes with different combinations of 14 cores were most favorable. The optimal sampling in patients with no previous ASAP and %fPSA > 10% was a scheme with a combination of 20 cores.

Conclusions

Both the number and the location of biopsy cores taken affect cancer detection rates in a repeated biopsy setting. We developed an internally validated flowchart to identify the most advantageous set of sampling sites according to patient characteristics.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^117D17rh]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety

Ultrasound applications are considered safe for patients, according to the guidelines of the British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS) and European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB). However, depending on the application and device, thermal effects could theoretically occur in the tissues being scanned, particularly in the case of Doppler ultrasound.

Ultrasound education should include discussion of possible effects of ultrasound on human tissue, mainly through thermal and non-thermal (or mechanical) mechanisms. These relate to tissue heating, cavitation and mechanical overload. The "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principle of potential thermal effect, as described by the thermal index (TI), and mechanical effect, described by the mechanical index (MI), should be included in ultrasound education, under the heading of safety.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^1165DpiN]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several sonographic societies such as AIUM, BMUs, and recently EFSUMB recommend the use of lung sonography depending on exposure time not to exceed a MI > 0.4–0.7. In obese patients, PCH is much less likely to occur during LUS due to high attenuation of intercostal tissue. The use of the ALARA principal is strongly recommended whenever LUS is performed above the recommended MI. Reducing exposure output and scan duration, independent of mode, significantly decreases the likelihood of PCH induction and its extent. A LUS specific Pre‐Set should be used when provided by the scanner. Such Pre‐Sets are optimized for imaging aspects and vary over a wide acoustic output range. Therefore, before examination, the lung settings should be setup and stored with an initial MI < 0.4 and this should only be increased in case of imaging needs.

The poorly defined guidelines for LUS based on the output power settings (eg, MI) and scan duration require further investigation for development of specific safety limits for US technologies when applied to the monitoring and diagnosis of lung diseases. To this end a specific Lung Safety Index including TI, MI and other pertinent parameters should be investigated in future studies.

Statement 7 (Clinical Statement)

There is a need for high quality studies (randomized, prospective) to achieve acceptance for the diagnostic value of LUS as performed for other screening tests (breast, heart).

Guidelines

Perform LUS on the largest possible area of the chest that is available during a LUS examination.

Limitation of the area (field, region) examined may be justified by the patient's clinical condition (trauma), limited accessibility, other practical aspects such as the capability to cooperate, and chest condition (scars, obesity).

### Quality initiatives* radiation risk: what you should know to tell your patient [^116X5dJb]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

The steady increase in the number of radiologic procedures being performed is undeniably having a beneficial impact on healthcare. However, it is also becoming common practice to quantify the health detriment from radiation exposure by calculating the number of cancer-related deaths inferred from the effective dose delivered to a given patient population. The inference of a certain number of expected deaths from the effective dose is to be discouraged, but it remains important as a means of raising professional awareness of the danger associated with ionizing radiation. The risk associated with a radiologic examination appears to be rather low compared with the natural risk. However, any added risk, no matter how small, is unacceptable if it does not benefit the patient. The concept of diagnostic reference levels should be used to reduce variations in practice among institutions and to promote optimal dose indicator ranges for specific imaging protocols. In general, the basic principles of radiation protection (eg, justification and optimization of a procedure) need to be respected to help counteract the unjustified explosion in the number of procedures being performed.

### Multimodal AI model for preoperative prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer using whole slide images [^113LcV3k]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current clinical practice frequently incorporates preoperative ultrasound and intraoperative SLNB to refine patient selection for ALND. While these methods offer valuable information, they are subject to limitations in both sensitivity and specificity, and their effectiveness is dependent on the experience and expertise of the clinicians involved. Preoperative ultrasound, though non-invasive and rapid, can yield false negatives. SLNB, while highly sensitive in detecting metastasis, exhibits lower specificity and adds complexity and time to the surgical procedure.

METACANS offers a unique approach by providing an objective, experience-independent assessment of ALNM risk based on the analysis of primary tumor biopsy WSIs. This approach aims to complement existing clinical methods, mitigating their individual limitations. The model's high NPV suggests its potential to reduce the number of patients undergoing unnecessary ALNDs. However, the lower specificity necessitates a strategy that incorporates METACANS within a broader clinical decision-making framework, potentially using it in conjunction with preoperative ultrasound or SLNB to improve overall accuracy and minimize the risk of false positives. Future research will focus on improving the model's specificity through various strategies, including model refinement, data augmentation, and feature selection, to enhance its clinical utility and reliability. Ultimately, the goal is to optimize the balance between sensitivity and specificity to provide a more robust and clinically valuable tool for breast cancer management.

In summary, our study introduced the METACANS model, an approach for predicting ALN metastasis from primary tumor biopsy samples in patients with breast cancer. Although efficient diagnostic methods such as SLNB are being developed to prevent invasive surgeries in patients, the significance of our research lies in diagnosing images from primary tumor biopsy samples and analyzing them in relation to metastasis using pathobiological knowledge. This study aligns with the growing trend toward patient-friendly diagnostic methods, potentially preventing unnecessary ALND and reducing invasive procedures. Although the current performance may not be optimal for immediate clinical application, the insights gained from this research set the stage for further innovation in this field.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Dose minimization strategies in X-ray fluoroscopy, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and cardiovascular nuclear scintigraphy emphasize appropriate study selection, proper equipment status, protocol optimization, and personnel protection. For X-ray fluoroscopy, the page states to 'Use alternative nonionization-based imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, electromagnetic mapping) when appropriate', and advises 'Optimal system positioning, minimal imaging field size, minimal exposure time', to use the 'Slowest frame rate and the smallest dose per frame consistent with diagnostic quality imaging and appropriate procedure guidance', and ensure 'Optimal use of protective aprons and shields, maximize distance from the x-ray source, and minimize patient exposure (which, in turn, minimizes medical personnel exposure)'. For X-ray CT, it instructs to 'Ensure that an x-ray CT examination is the optimal imaging technique to answer the clinical question', use equipment 'current state of the art, in good working order, and calibrated for minimal dose exposures', 'Select the lowest-dose scan protocol that will provide images of diagnostic quality to answer the clinical question', and 'Confine the imaged body region to the smallest area needed to answer the clinical question'. For nuclear cardiology, it states to 'Ensure that nuclear cardiology study is the optimal imaging technique to answer the clinical question. Consider PET rather than SPECT imaging, if feasible and appropriate', to 'Select a stress-rest protocol when appropriate (according to ASNC guidelines)', and that for radiopharmaceuticals 'Tc-99m is preferred for SPECT. Avoid Tl-201 except for studies focused particularly on myocardial viability issues', with dosing to 'Use the smallest injected dose that will provide sufficient counts for imaging in a practical time period'.

### Pragmatic recommendations for identification and triage of patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^111Xo8g4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Availability of radiologic diagnostic modalities to augment triage will be impacted by material resources (e.g. whether the machines are available at a given center), status of the machines (e.g. ability to repair and maintain them, and ability to properly clean them after use on potentially infectious patients), and availability of clinical staff who are skilled in performing and interpreting the studies. Although each of these elements will be largely influenced by the resources available before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that they will potentially be negatively impacted in the setting of the pandemic. This means that imaging modalities that may usually be available at a center may be temporarily unavailable (or less available) during the COVID-19 pandemic because of human and material resource strains.

Feasibility of these studies will likewise largely be determined by the pre-pandemic resources of individual clinical sites, as increasing capacity to perform diagnostic imaging in the setting of the pandemic will be challenging.

Affordability must be considered in the context of affordability to the healthcare system and affordability to the patient. Some imaging modalities, such as CT and radiographs, are more likely to be billed directly to the patient or their insurer, whereas modalities such as point-of-care lung ultrasound may be more "affordable" to the patient if they are not billed for. However, point-of-care ultrasound may require time from the primary bedside clinician, whereas radiographs and CT scans typically are performed by ancillary teams. In situations where the providers performing initial triage have increased clinical load (such as during a pandemic), it may be less feasible to perform point-of-care ultrasound because of limited time. In addition, in resource-limited settings, point-of-care lung ultrasound is less frequently performed without appropriate quality assurance programs and skill building programs, also challenging feasibility.

Although radiation exposure is always a safety consideration, this exposure is relatively benign when considering the use of one or a few additional imaging tests per patient. However, transportation of potentially severely ill patients to radiology departments to perform radiographs or CT scans introduces additional risk of clinical decompensation. In addition, use of radiologic equipment (e.g. CT or ultrasound machines) or spaces (e.g. imaging suites) for highly infectious patients introduces the risk of viral transmission to other patients or staff. This risk, and the time and resources required to mitigate it through cleaning, must be considered.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^1113h2x6]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Closing Remarks and Outcomes

In most European countries, there is no legislative provision for limiting the performance of ultrasound to any specific group of medical doctors, or even to doctors in general. It is not likely that this position will change in the near future. As radiologists, our concerns should be patient welfare, and safe, competent use of all imaging modalities for the benefit of patients. Our focus must be on standards, of education, training, performance of studies, and the other elements of ultrasound practice outlined in this article.

The standards applied to imaging use of ultrasound should be the same for all users of the modality. As imaging professionals, radiologists have integrated knowledge of different imaging modalities and techniques which positions us well to act as arbiters of good ultrasound practice. Adoption of legislation and best practice guidelines for carrying out ultrasound examinations must be common for both radiologists and non-radiologist physicians. Success in harmonising ultrasound standards and practices will require cooperation among all interested parties, including UEMS, ESR, EFSUMB, and other specialty societies; consensus positions can then be proposed and advocated in a united manner, for future legal implementation.

For further information on regulatory acoustic output comparisons, see. Because some laboratory studies have shown the potential for both thermal and mechanical bioeffects at diagnostic acoustic output levels, and because of the particular concern for fetal exposures), prudent use has been advocated by national and international. bodies concerned with medical ultrasound use and safety.

For example, an impedance check of each transducer element may provide a preliminary evaluation of the element integrity and function. Device manufacturers implement methods to communicate the results of the transducer performance tests to the operators, and identify regions of the image that have been compromised by transducer.

### Focused ultrasound: noninvasive image-guided therapy [^114zQNHs]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Invasive open surgery used to be compulsory to access tumor mass to perform excision or resection. Development of minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures followed, as well as catheter-based approaches, such as stenting, endovascular surgery, chemoembolization, brachytherapy, which minimize side effects and reduce the risks to patients. Completely noninvasive procedures bring further benefits in terms of reducing risk, procedure time, recovery time, potential of infection, or other side effects. Focusing ultrasound waves from the outside of the body specifically at the disease site has proven to be a safe noninvasive approach to localized ablative hyperthermia, mechanical ablation, and targeted drug delivery. Focused ultrasound as a medical intervention was proposed decades ago, but it only became feasible to plan, guide, monitor, and control the treatment procedures with advanced radiological imaging capabilities. The purpose of this review is to describe the imaging capabilities and approaches to perform these tasks, with the emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. Some procedures already are in clinical practice, with more at the clinical trial stage. Imaging is fully integrated in the workflow and includes the following: (1) planning, with definition of the target regions and adjacent organs at risk; (2) real-time treatment monitoring via thermometry imaging, cavitation feedback, and motion control, to assure targeting and safety to adjacent normal tissues; and (3) evaluation of treatment efficacy, via assessment of ablation and physiological parameters, such as blood supply. This review also focuses on sonosensitive microparticles and nanoparticles, such as microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. They enable ultrasound energy deposition down to the microvascular level, induce vascular inflammation and shutdown, accelerate clot dissolution, and perform targeted drug delivery interventions, including focal gene delivery. Especially exciting is the ability to perform noninvasive drug delivery via opening of the blood-brain barrier at the desired areas within the brain. Overall, focused ultrasound under image guidance is rapidly developing, to become a choice noninvasive interventional radiology tool to treat disease and cure patients.

### The ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block: volume-dependent injectate distribution [^111i6ePp]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optimal pain management is a priority in patients with multiple rib fractures as it prevents pulmonary complications associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly population. Thus far, both thoracic epidural and paravertebral (PV) analgesia have been used, demonstrating comparably effective pain relief. However, the PV blockade (PVB) is associated with greater hemodynamic stability, particularly important in potentially unstable trauma patients where a mild to moderate degree of impaired hemostasis may not amount to a regional block contraindication. Nevertheless, anticipated major bleeding and subsequent major coagulation disorders still limit the wide PVB utility in these settings. Though very small, the risks of pneumothorax and inadvertent epidural and intrathecal drug administration also remain serious considerations.

Ultrasound guidance offers a potential benefit of reducing these complications and increasing the success rate because of the real-time visualization of the PV space, surrounding structures, the tip of the approaching needle, and the spread of local anesthetic. So far, however, there has been no study conclusively supporting such claims. The sonographic window is typically rather limited, often precluding optimal PV space image acquisition while the block needle is advanced in the immediate proximity to both pleura and intervertebral foramina. Therefore, the risk of pleural puncture and even the possibility of epidural or intrathecal spread of local anesthetics are still present.

Ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block is one of the newer and technically simpler alternatives to the traditional PV block. The first case report by Pfeiffer et alof a landmark lamina technique was followed by a study in mastectomy patientswhere this "blind" technique was used to inject local anesthetic between the thoracic laminae and the deep paraspinous muscles. This technique would logically decrease the chances of pleural injury, while the risk of inadvertent neuraxial injection remains. In 2013, Zeballos et alsuggested improving the lamina technique by mandating ultrasound guidance, defining the site of injection as "retrolaminar" by real-time sonographic identification of the lamina and the needle tip–lamina contact, thus minimizing the risk of epidural injection associated with the blind technique. This was immediately followed by a report by the same group describing their first experiences with the retrolaminar technique in patients with multiple rib fractures.

### Diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound: recommendations from an expert panel [^117H9Ahr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has emerged as a powerful tool to help anesthesiologists guide patient care in both the perioperative setting and the subspecialty arenas. Although anesthesiologists can turn to guideline statements pertaining to other aspects of ultrasound use, to date there remains little in the way of published guidance regarding diagnostic PoCUS. To this end, in 2018, the American Society of Anesthesiologists chartered an ad hoc committee consisting of 23 American Society of Anesthesiologists members to provide recommendations on this topic. The ad hoc committee convened and developed a committee work product. This work product was updated in 2021 by an expert panel of the ad hoc committee to produce the document presented herein. The document, which represents the consensus opinion of a group of practicing anesthesiologists with established expertise in diagnostic ultrasound, addresses the following issues: (1) affirms the practice of diagnostic PoCUS by adequately trained anesthesiologists, (2) identifies the scope of practice of diagnostic PoCUS relevant to anesthesiologists, (3) suggests the minimum level of training needed to achieve competence, (4) provides recommendations for how diagnostic PoCUS can be used safely and ethically, and (5) provides broad guidance about diagnostic ultrasound billing.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114JPQUR]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Radiation exposure — radiation exposure remains a factor in determining the best utilization of MDCT imaging, and MDCT technology dose-adjusting software based on body region, patient body habitus, and iterative reconstruction methodologies has reduced radiation exposure significantly on modern scanners. The potential deleterious impact of radiation exposure is of greatest concern for pediatric and pregnant patient populations, and close cooperation with the radiologist for proper technique adjustment is encouraged. Expert consensus currently does not specify a definitive lifetime risk for malignancy, though it is likely to be exceedingly small, and providers need to understand this issue and balance the diminutive risk of exposure against the risk from potential missed or delayed diagnosis. Bedside ultrasound is a portable non-ionizing imaging modality with limited utility in the stable trauma patient but may be helpful in the unstable patient, and alternative non-ionizing modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carry significant inherent risks including remote transport for imaging, frequent requirement for sedation, limited availability for patient monitoring and resuscitation, and longer acquisition times.

### American Society of Echocardiography COVID-19 statement update: lessons learned and preparation for future pandemics [^116ZDVNY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Echocardiography laboratory triage and performance during COVID-19 emphasize risk–benefit assessment, equitable access, and maintained timeliness benchmarks. Decisions about performance of echocardiographic studies should incorporate benefit and risk assessment for the patient, as well as risk for the staff, within the overall context of conventional, contingency, or crisis standards of care, and each facility should develop screening and triaging protocols based on the nature of the test, the risk of disease transmission, available resources, standards of care, and availability of clinician-performed cardiac ultrasound and/or alternative imaging modalities. Echocardiography laboratories should avoid denying an appropriate echocardiogram solely based on a patient's COVID status, and if the test is appropriate, it should be performed in a manner that would minimize the risk of exposure without compromising management or delaying therapeutic interventions (unless in crisis standards of care). To maintain access while minimizing exposure, echocardiography laboratories may choose to perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at the bedside or set aside a specific room for patients who have tested positive. Inpatient echocardiography laboratories are required to have benchmarks for timeliness of performance and interpretation of studies based on the acuity of the patient and the indication, and the patient's COVID status should not affect these benchmarks.

### Risk reduction in pleural procedures: sonography, simulation and supervision [^1129Qmni]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Complications from pleural drainage procedures are common, but their incidence is often underrecognized. Significant morbidity and mortality can arise, particularly as a result of poor procedural technique, lack of training and inadequate supervision. This review discusses safety considerations of common pleural procedures, methods for risk minimization and training issues.

Recent Findings

Recent data have identified deaths and significant adverse events associated with pleural drainage procedures. Evidence suggests that significant risk reduction might be achieved by restricting the number of physicians authorized to perform a pleural aspiration to a smaller expert group who have had specific training and regularly perform the procedure. Pleural ultrasound has been shown to increase the accuracy of fluid localization and decrease the risk of postprocedure pneumothorax.

Summary

Strategies to improve physician training, reduce unnecessary pleural procedures and improve site selection (using pleural ultrasound) may reduce complication rates. Consequently, several international authorities have recently published updated guidelines and educational packages aimed at improving the safety of pleural intervention. Pleural ultrasound has the potential to significantly decrease adverse event rates, but requires specific training and has several possible pitfalls.

### Sample size of trials investigating the impact of point-of-care ultrasound-guided strategies on patient outcomes: a systematic review [^113aobaH]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The design of RCTs on POCUS‐guided therapy should have realistic considerations regarding sample size requirements to determine the impact on patient outcomes. In theory, this involves producing an accurate estimation of the proportion of participants in which POCUS will yield information that will significantly influence decision‐making. Research efforts should continue to define the optimal approach for generating the evidence base for the use of POCUS in medicine.

### Radiation risks: what is to be done? [^115Bjfkb]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

What is currently known about radiologic risks is reviewed, policies that should be adopted based on our current knowledge are proposed, and how these policies can be applied to adequately protect patients in everyday clinical practice is described.

Conclusion

All activities in life (e.g., driving automobiles) are associated with risks, and medical imaging is no different, so the most important message to convey to patients is whether a proposed examination is worthwhile. Our collective goal should be ensuring that all radiologic examinations are justified and are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), which maximizes the benefits of medical imaging for our patients.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^116UdtGn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A fluid challenge is performed by the rapid administration of relatively low fluid volumes to assess the cardiac preload reserve of the patient. This is usually interpreted using CVP and arterial pressure in resource-limited settings. However, the fluid challenge requires the administration of a fluid bolus to the patient. Therefore, the use of dynamic tests that predict fluid responsiveness, and help prevent fluid overload, can be vital in these settings. However, most of these tests require continuous cardiac output measurement and invasive mechanical ventilation to accurately predict fluid responsiveness, which poses a challenge in resource-limited settings.

Pulse pressure variation (PPV) reliably predicts fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock. The test has a few limitations, the most common being the use of low tidal volume ventilation, where false negative values may occur. The tidal volume challenge (TVC) is a novel test that can overcome this limitation. Since PPV and TVC require only an invasive arterial line, they can be used in mechanically ventilated patients when cardiac output monitoring is unavailable, making them particularly useful in resource-limited settings to predict fluid responsiveness. Alternatively, fluid responsiveness can be predicted with ultrasound using respiratory variations in inferior vena cava diameter. Though they may be expensive, ultrasound devices are increasingly available in LMIC's and acquiring the device is a one-time cost. It is important to note that these indices are more reliable in mechanically ventilated patients.

Passive leg raising (PLR) test can reliably predict fluid responsiveness in both ventilated and non-ventilated patients. While it requires cardiac output monitoring to be accurate, PLR can be measured with ultrasound, if available. Alternatively, PPV can be used as demonstrated by a recent study showing that a reduction in PPV by > 3.5% after performing PLR can reliably predict fluid responsiveness.

The effect of balanced crystalloids, including both Ringer's lactate and acetate solutions such as Plasmalyte, compared with 0.9% saline in the critically ill remains unclear. A recent systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis (BEST-Living) involving 34,685 patients from six trials, concluded that there is a high probability that use of balanced solutions in the ICU reduces in-hospital mortality. However, the certainty of the evidence was moderate, the absolute risk reduction was small, and in patients with traumatic brain injury, the use of balanced solutions was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Administration of 0.9% saline may be considered, provided the serum electrolyte, especially chloride levels are monitored.

### Clinical imaging guidelines part 2: risks, benefits, barriers, and solutions [^1163Y41p]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

A recent international meeting was convened by two United Nations bodies to focus on international collaboration on clinical appropriateness/referral guidelines for use in medical imaging. This paper, the second of 4 from this technical meeting, addresses barriers to the successful development/deployment of clinical imaging guidelines and means of overcoming them. It reflects the discussions of the attendees, and the issues identified are treated under 7 headings: ■ Practical Strategy for Development and Deployment of Guidelines; ■ Governance Arrangements and Concerns with Deployment of Guidelines; ■ Finance, Sustainability, Reimbursement, and Related Issues; ■ Identifying Benefits and Radiation Risks from Radiological Examinations; ■ Information Given to Patients and the Public, and Consent Issues; ■ Special Concerns Related to Pregnancy; and ■ The Research Agenda. Examples of topics identified include the observation that guideline development is a global task and there is no case for continuing it as the project of the few professional organizations that have been brave enough to make the long-term commitment required. Advocacy for guidelines should include the expectations that they will facilitate: (1) better health care delivery; (2) lower cost of that delivery; with (3) reduced radiation dose and associated health risks. Radiation protection issues should not be isolated; rather, they should be integrated with the overall health care picture. The type of dose/radiation risk information to be provided with guidelines should include the uncertainty involved and advice on application of the precautionary principle with patients. This principle may be taken as an extension of the well-established medical principle of "first do no harm".

### Overview of therapeutic ultrasound applications and safety considerations: 2024 update [^116hiAEa]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Safety

Precautions for MRI‐guided focused ultrasound procedures have been reviewed previously at length. Briefly, therapeutic ultrasound transducers can potentially apply excessive heat to superficial tissues between the source and the intended target. This problem can be ameliorated by cycling the transducer power to allow for adequate cooling between exposures, circulating cooling water, or using cooling balloons.

Sub‐therapeutic exposures can be performed to verify the accuracy of targeting. Extra care should be taken to avoid collateral exposure to nearby tissues that are thermally sensitive, such as nerves, bones, and bowel. Cavitation detection should be used to minimize the risk of undesired mechanical bioeffects.

The standard to promote patient safety for therapeutic ultrasound procedures (IEC 60601‐2‐62) does not allow: 1) display of incorrect numerical values associated with the therapy; 2) production of unwanted ultrasound output; 3) production of excessive ultrasound output; 4) reflection of excessive ultrasonic power at the transducer/patient interface due to inadequate coupling; 5) unwanted targeting of tissue regions away from the intended target region; and 6) production of unwanted thermal or mechanical tissue damage in or distal to the region of interest.

### Canadian internal medicine ultrasound (CIMUS) expert consensus statement on the use of lung ultrasound for the assessment of medical inpatients with known or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 [^1126mJZ5]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations on the Use ofin the Assessment of Medical Inpatients With Known or Suspected‐19 and Moderate or Severe Symptoms if chestHas Already Been Performed

18. If the chest CT findings are positive for pneumonitis without additional concerning features, and the pretest probability of an alternative or secondary diagnosis is low, we do not recommend performing an LUS examination (no consensus on the strength of the recommendation).

For a patient with moderate or severe symptoms whose chest CT findings are positive for pneumonitis without additional concerning features, and the pretest probability of an alternative or secondary diagnosis is low, LUS is not indicated, as the results are unlikely to alter patient treatment in these instances or assist substantially with monitoring (Figure 1).

19. If the chest CT findings are negative for pneumonitis or other concerning features such as pulmonary embolism, and the pretest probability of an alternative or secondary diagnosis is low, we do not recommend performing an LUS examination (no consensus on the strength of the recommendation).

Given the superior accuracy of chest CT over LUS, including its ability to image centrally based abnormalities and to diagnose pulmonary embolism, in the setting of negative chest CT findings, an additional role for LUS, although unlikely harmful, is likely limited and may not represent optimal use of available resources, as the results are unlikely to alter patient treatment. As such, we do not recommend performing an LUS examination.

Recommendations on the Use ofin the Assessment of Medical Inpatients With Known or Suspected‐19 and Minimal Symptoms

20. Lung US should be the initial imaging modality of choice (strong recommendation).

For patients with COVID‐19 with minimal symptoms, chest radiographic findings may be negative in as high as 58% of cases, and the use of chest radiography in these patients is not currently recommended by either the Canadian Association of Thoracic Radiology/Canadian Association of Radiologistsor the Fleischner Society. Lung US may potentially have higher sensitivityin addition to lower radiation risks. Thus, in settings in which a device is readily available and the practitioner is skilled at LUS, we recommend that LUS be considered the initial imaging modality of choice (Figure 2).

### Overview of diagnostic ultrasound safety: review for research and institutional review boards [^112o3Rnq]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound is widely regarded as a safe imaging modality; however, emerging ultrasound-based techniques-such as shear wave elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound-operate with varying acoustic output parameters that may approach or exceed traditional diagnostic limits. As these technologies are increasingly integrated into human research studies, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) face the challenge of assessing their safety profiles. This article provides a comprehensive, organ-, and modality-specific review of current guidelines for ultrasound exposure parameters, including the mechanical index (MI), thermal index (TI), and acoustic intensity. Special emphasis is placed on less conventional applications, such as elastography in the eye and fetal applications, and on understanding the thermal and mechanical bioeffects associated with emerging techniques. We clarify distinctions in safety oversight and provide practical guidance to IRB members tasked with evaluating diagnostic ultrasound research protocols. Our aim is to facilitate informed decision-making and ensure patient safety while enabling innovation in ultrasound-based clinical research.

### American Society of Echocardiography consensus statement on the clinical applications of ultrasonic contrast agents in echocardiography [^116A3eoG]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit contrast echocardiography — In ICU patients, contrast imaging has no incremental risk for death compared with noncontrast echocardiography, and for pulmonary hypertension or unstable cardiopulmonary conditions the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently relaxed the prior black-box specification from a contraindication to a warning; additional monitoring with single-lead electrocardiography and pulse oximetry continues for 30 minutes after contrast agent administration. Key Point 5 states that contrast enhancement of transthoracic echocardiograms in technically difficult patients in the ICU "can be used to provide bedside assessment of cardiac structure and function, recognizing that risk and benefit must be determined on an individual basis in critically ill patients and that appropriate monitoring must be available".

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^116TQFw4]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and ultrasound — is addressed with directive and modality details as follows: Guidance published by the Orthopaedic Trauma Association "strongly recommend the use of TENS as an adjunctive therapy for pain relief following orthopaedic injury and orthopaedic surgery", with TENS contraindicated when there is "skin disruption at the site of application, indwelling pacemakers or defibrillators, and lymphedema". Therapeutic ultrasound "uses low-intensity sound waves to generate heat within the soft tissues", may improve local physiology as "this therapy improves blood flow and reduces muscle spasm, potentially accelerating the healing of muscle and tendon injuries", and is characterized as low risk because it is "typically low risk and not painful at the dose intensities used for therapy". High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) "uses higher intensity sound waves distributed to a very focal target", is "thought to work via local neuromodulatory effects, including demyelination of small afferent sensory nerves in the target area", and has shown analgesia in other conditions, but "evidence supporting the use of HIFU in the acute trauma setting is lacking".

### Recommendations for cardiac point-of-care ultrasound nomenclature [^114gtLnZ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) nomenclature — background and scope: Standardization of nomenclature is stated as essential for accurate and efficient knowledge transfer amid a heterogeneous and ambiguous current state of POCUS terminology. The statement was developed through collaboration with representatives of various medical societies and a diverse Writing Group including a specialist in medical linguistics, aiming to contextualize and standardize cardiac POCUS to reduce confusion and enhance patient safety and to establish a deliberate vocabulary across academic and patient care settings. The Writing Group agreed that POCUS terminology must be sufficiently unrelated to any specialty, ultrasound equipment, or clinical setting to prioritize a patient-centric approach, while remaining applicable to the world community, including low-resource settings. The document explicitly does not extensively address billing, credentialing, legal liability, or other region-specific elements and is intended as a starting point for future, more specific work. The scientific statement aims to review the evolution of cardiac POCUS-related terms; outline recommendations distinguishing "basic cardiac POCUS/ FoCUS", "advanced cardiac POCUS", "consultative echocardiography", and "ultrasound assisted physical examination"; address implications for current practice; and discuss implications for novel technologies and future research.

### Office cystoscopy and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies pose minimal risk: prospective evaluation of 921 procedures [^116nvsAf]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the outcomes of 2 commonly performed urologic office procedures as a part of a process to align these with the Joint Commission standards to ensure patient safety. We determined whether cystoscopy and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy performed in the office setting pose minimal risk to patients.

Methods

An evaluation of urologic office procedures in the office clinic setting of an academic medical center was prospectively performed during 3 different periods to document patient and system events. The patients included those undergoing cystoscopy for workup of hematuria, history of bladder cancer, or other indicated conditions (n = 554) and patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer (n = 367). All consecutive patients were evaluated.

Results

A total of 7 patient events (0.76%) and 101 system events (10.97%) were documented. The most significant adverse patient event was 1 case of acute bacterial prostatitis due to quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. In most cases, the system event rate reflected a delay of > 15 minutes in the initiation of the procedure. No patient experienced significant bleeding, perforation, or a major cardiopulmonary event.

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that cystoscopy and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy procedures performed in the office setting pose a minimal risk to patients. This information could be useful for hospitals and practices that are undergoing efforts to align their individual policies with current Joint Commission standards.

### COVUS: an algorithm to maximize the use of point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency management of COVID-19 [^114fFgM7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with diagnostic challenges because COVID-19 can cause varied end-organ failures that mimic respiratory distress of pulmonary origin. Early identification of concurrent complications can significantly alter patient management and course. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can be particularly useful in helping to differentiate concomitant complications with COVID-19. While lung POCUS findings related to COVID-19 have been published, little guidance exists on how ultrasound can be incorporated into a more comprehensive evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19.

Objectives

We devised a pathway called COVUS that incorporates POCUS into the initial evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19 to guide diagnosis and management.

Discussion

The pathway was derived based on a review of literature, consensus from the ultrasound faculty, as well as feedback from the entire faculty group at one academic institution with high volumes of patients with COVID-19. The scanning protocol uses a cardiac-first (rather than lung-first) approach to identify potential concomitant organ failure that may immediately alter management.

Conclusions

COVUS aims to maximize identification of the most immediately life-threatening complications while minimizing time at bedside and provider risk of exposure to COVID-19.

Cardiac ultrasonography guideline — GRADE factors for evidence assessment and recommendation development specify that Section A categorizes the outcome factor as Critical, Important, Less important, or Not important, while Section B (factors 2–10) sets study-design starting points and quality levels with "Randomized controlled trial = 4" and "Observational studies = 2", mapping to "A = High = Four points", "B = Moderate = Three points", "C = Lowc = Two points", and "D = Very lowc = One point". Quality is lowered by the five downgraders — "Risk of bias" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Inconsistency" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Indirectness" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Imprecision" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), and "Publication bias" (−1 Likely; −2 Very likely) — and raised by three upgraders — "Large effect" (+1 Large; +2 Very large), "Dose response" (+1 Evidence of a gradient), and "Antagonistic bias" (+1 All plausible confounding would reduce the effect, or +1 Would suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect). "Based on the design, the evidence will qualify for four points (if randomized controlled trial) or two points (if observational) and then points will move down by one or two points (by downgraders) or up (by upgraders) if applicable as indicated in the table", and Section C (factors 11–15) lists "The five-GRADE transformers", with voting "using ninepoint Likert's scale".

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^111PJjkk]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

AKI RISK STRATIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

Risk stratification

In community and hospital settings, risk stratification of patients using a combination of baseline risks and acute exposures is important. In the future, risk stratification could incorporate various clinical contexts: geographic region, onset in community or hospital settings, and location within hospitals. Although the 2012 guideline discussed risk models and clinical scores, these were limited to models for cardiothoracic surgery, contrast exposure, and aminoglycoside administration. Many other clinical scenarios and contexts, such as sepsis and cardiac failure, require guidance for risk assessment. In clinical practice, risk models may be tailored for location and context. Multicenter studies are needed for externally validating models as well as standardization and correlation with outcomes. Furthermore, since 2012, biomarkers for AKI risk stratification have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and integrated in recent guideline recommendations for cardiac surgery.

Determining cause and prognosis

Determining the etiology of AKI is essential for management; however, this can be difficult, especially in the presence of multifactorial mechanisms. Newer developments related to monitoring and evaluating risk progression include e-alert systems, machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence for AKI recognition and monitoring,– as well as models based upon the renal angina index, furosemide stress test (FST), or biomarkers. – In revisiting the guideline for AKI, severity of AKI should be based not only upon serum creatinine elevation and urine output, but also upon duration, possibly with the inclusion of biomarkers. The need to increase attention for persistent (> 48 hours) AKI should also be considered.

The 2012 KDIGO guideline suggests performing a kidney biopsy when the cause of AKI is unclear. Potential benefits for biopsy in AKI are controversial and further research is needed. Since the 2012 guideline, which recommended ultrasound for assessing kidney size and the presence of an obstruction, new imaging techniques have become available, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound, doppler ultrasound, and blood oxygenation level — dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. – The role of these techniques in changing outcomes of AKI is yet to be determined.

### Sample size of trials investigating the impact of point-of-care ultrasound-guided strategies on patient outcomes: a systematic review [^116d5SRz]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Systematic Review

Eligible Studies

We aimed to include completed randomized clinical trials investigating the impact on patient outcome of a management strategy based on information from POCUS compared to usual care. We excluded trials related to the use of POCUS for procedural guidance and for which the primary outcome was not an outcome related to the patient (i.e. diagnostic performance).

Search Strategy

We performed a systematic search over the PubMed database in July 2024 combining a validated Cochrane term for randomized clinical trialsand a term specific for studies involving Point‐Of‐Care ultrasound(see online supplemental Appendix 1). We also identified additional trials through the bibliography of included studies. A first selection was made based on title, with each entry being reviewed by two investigators. A second selection based on abstract and full‐text review was subsequently performed.

Data Extraction

We extracted information about the population and the intervention investigated in the selected reports. We collected information about planned and final sample size (N), sample size justifications, and reasons for non‐achievement of the planned sample size if reported.

Data Analysis

We report the planned and actual sample size of included trials, as well as the relative difference between the final and the planned sample size (as a %). The reasons for non‐achievement of planned sample size are reported in a descriptive manner when available.

Risk of Bias and Quality of Evidence

In the selected reports, we determine if the calculation of the required sample size is reported within the text or the associated supplementary material. We did not evaluate other components usually included in the risk of bias assessment due to the specific focus of this systematic review.

Ultrasound enhancing agents (UEAs) — class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) framework for diagnostic strategies is adopted, with COR defined as Class I (strong): "Benefits are much greater than risks. The procedure should be performed".; Class IIa (moderate): "Benefits are greater than risks, and the procedure can be useful if performed".; Class IIb (weak): "Benefits are slightly greater than risks, and the procedure might be reasonable to perform".; and Class III: "The procedures offers no benefit or is harmful if performed". LOE definitions are Level A: "High-quality evidence from more than one randomized controlled trial (RCT), a meta-analysis of high-quality RCTs, or one or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry data"; Level B-R: "Moderate-quality evidence from one or more RCTs or a meta-analysis of moderate-quality RCTs"; Level B-NR: "Moderate-quality evidence from one or more well-designed nonrandomized trials, observational studies, or registry studies or meta-analysis of such studies"; Level C-LD: "Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations in design or execution or a meta-analysis of such studies"; and Level C-EO: "Consensus based on clinical experience".

### Use of carotid ultrasound to identify subclinical vascular disease and evaluate cardiovascular disease risk: a consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography carotid intima-media thickness task force. endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine [^111FmJwT]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid ultrasound instrumentation and image display — standardized acquisition and equipment settings are emphasized: The carotid arteries should be interrogated using a state-of-the-art ultrasound system with a linear-array transducer operating at a fundamental frequency of at least 7 MHz, and use of ultrasound contrast is a research technique that is not recommended for clinical assessment of CIMT at this time. Most patients can be scanned at a standard depth of 4 cm, but resolution decreases with increasing imaging depth, with the typical pixel size when imaging at a 4-cm depth approximately 0.1 mm. Because CIMT measurements are extremely small, differences of 1 digital pixel can classify patients in different risk categories, so attention to instrumentation and standardized imaging and reading protocols is critical. The use of the zoom function is discouraged because most studies relating CIMT to CVD events did not use zoomed images and because the zoom function on some commercial ultrasound systems increase the pixel size rather than resolution. Protocol deviations from published procedures require validation, including evaluation of reproducibility.

### Ultrasound probe scratches the pleural surface: revealing the shades of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia [^115A2KHB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a challenge of unprecedented proportions and remains a concern despite months of devastation. Its entire impact remains uncertain. This virus affects multiple organs of the body; however, lung involvement determines major morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is enigmatic due to its unmeasurable virulence, unpredictable course and lack of definitive treatment. Patients may endure a turbulent clinical journey, face uncertainty and prolonged hospitalisation. Management depends on sound clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, dedicated patient-care areas, risk assessment and establishing ceilings of care. Such plans heavily rely on the availability of prompt swab results which may not be feasible. Hence, an efficient clinical correlation of suspicious cases with radiological findings is paramount.

COVID-19 pneumonia can exist with initially indiscernible radiographic findings which may later evolve. Chest X-ray and CT scans are the most frequently used imaging modalities as the turbulent nature of COVID-19 pneumonia can lead to rapid radiological changes. Various renowned radiology societies have formulated guidelines and protocols ensuring the best possible imaging to diagnose, monitor and evaluate COVID-19 pneumonia. When a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia deteriorates, updated imaging is required immediately. The ultimate choice depends on available resources, infection control protocols, personal protective equipment (PPE), logistics and local protocols. Thoracic ultrasound is a cutting-edge modality with advantages of being readily available, ambulatory, economical, reliable and user-friendly. It can be accessed safely within the intensive care setting and provides dynamic, real-time imaging which can be readily reproduced.

For patients in shock, decisions regarding administering or withholding IV fluids are both difficult and important. Although a strategy of relatively liberal fluid administration has traditionally been popular, recent trial results suggest that moving to a more fluid-restrictive approach may be prudent.

### Ultrasound-guided intervention: expanding horizons [^115jauVr]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-guided intervention has enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth because its many advantages over other guidance modalities have been recognized. The decreased procedure time, increased accuracy, and safety of procedures performed under ultrasound guidance are of obvious benefit to radiologist and patient alike for all interventional applications. Lesions once considered unsafe to sample are now reasonably approached with ultrasound guidance. As equipment technology continues to improve and radiologists increasingly recognize the benefits of guiding procedures with ultrasound, the shift of procedures away from CT and fluoroscopic guidance will continue and ultrasound guidance will become the guidance method of choice for most interventional procedures.

The use of ultrasound has developed over the last 50 years into an indispensable first-line test for the cardiac evaluation of symptomatic patients. The technologic miniaturization and improvement in transducer technology, as well as the implementation of educational curriculum changes in residency training programs and specialty practice, have facilitated the integration of focused cardiac ultrasound into practice by specialties such as emergency medicine. In the emergency department, focused cardiac ultrasound has become a fundamental tool to expedite the diagnostic evaluation of the patient at the bedside and to initiate emergent treatment and triage decisions by the emergency physician.

### Utility and safety of draining pleural effusions in mechanically ventilated patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fZ7Y3]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Clinicians may hesitate to perform thoracentesis in mechanically ventilated patients due to the risk of complications, particularly pneumothorax. This systematic review included studies that varied in setting, technique, use of ultrasound guidance and operator experience and found a low risk of complications in mechanically ventilated patients; the risk of pneumothorax was similar when studies were restricted to those performing simple thoracentesis with no drainage tube left in place. Sensitivity analysis using Bayesian methods found an even lower rate of complications than traditional meta-analysis. However, the true risk of complications may be higher outside of a study. We did not detect a reduction in complications associated with the use of periprocedural ultrasound guidance. A recent review of pneumothorax following thoracentesis among 24 studies of mostly spontaneously breathing patients found an overall rate of pneumothorax of 6.0% (95% CI 4.6% to 7.8%), of whom one-third required thoracostomy tube placement. Ultrasound guidance was associated with a reduced risk of pneumothorax in that study. Although the risk of pneumothorax was non-significantly higher among patients receiving mechanical ventilation in that review, we found a lower rate among studies restricted to mechanically ventilated patients. This may be (1) because in our review drainage methods frequently included temporarily secured drainage catheters or thoracostomy tubes (that eliminate most pneumothoraces if they occur); (2) mechanically ventilated patients may be sedated for the procedure allowing for optimal positioning and reducing patient movement and therefore a lower risk of lung puncture; or (3) possibly due to other differences in operator characteristics or approach for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Additionally, while we included all studies in the published meta-analysis that provided specific data on mechanically ventilated patients, we also incorporated data from several additional studies.

Strengths of this review include a broad literature search supplemented by contact with primary study investigators, consideration of a comprehensive set of outcomes, and consideration of alternate analytical approaches in sensitivity analyses. There are important limitations to this review related to the absence of controlled trials of pleural effusion drainage and lack of data on ventilator settings before and after drainage in some studies, which limited inferences regarding the effect of drainage on lung mechanics.

### Recommendations for cardiac point-of-care ultrasound nomenclature [^115Wc5vM]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). Medium credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) involves the acquisition, interpretation, and immediate clinical integration of ultrasonographic imaging performed by a treating clinician. The current state of cardiac POCUS terminology is heterogeneous and ambiguous, in part because it evolved through siloed specialty practices. In particular, the medical literature and colloquial medical conversation contain a wide variety of terms that equate to cardiac POCUS. While diverse terminology aided in the development and dissemination of cardiac POCUS throughout multiple specialties, it also contributes to confusion and raises patient safety concerns. This statement is the product of a diverse and inclusive Writing Group from multiple specialties, including medical linguistics, that employed an iterative process to contextualize and standardize a nomenclature for cardiac POCUS. We sought to establish a deliberate vocabulary that is sufficiently unrelated to any specialty, ultrasound equipment, or clinical setting to enhance consistency throughout the academic literature and patient care settings. This statement (1) reviews the evolution of cardiac POCUS-related terms; (2) outlines specific recommendations, distinguishing between intrinsic and practical differences in terminology; (3) addresses the implications of these recommendations for current practice; and (4) discusses the implications for novel technologies and future research.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult thoracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^114gRAWC]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Executive Summary: 1) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to guide thoracentesis to reduce the risk of complications, the most common being pneumothorax. 2) We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to increase the success rate of thoracentesis. 3) We recommend that ultrasound-guided thoracentesis should be performed or closely supervised by experienced operators. 4) We suggest that ultrasound guidance be used to reduce the risk of complications from thoracentesis in mechanically ventilated patients. 5) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify the chest wall, pleura, diaphragm, lung, and subdiaphragmatic organs throughout the respiratory cycle before selecting a needle insertion site. 6) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to detect the presence or absence of an effusion and approximate the volume of pleural fluid to guide clinical decision-making. 7) We recommend that ultrasound should be used to detect complex sonographic features, such as septations, to guide clinical decision-making regarding the timing and method of pleural drainage. 8) We suggest that ultrasound be used to measure the depth from the skin surface to the parietal pleura to help select an appropriate length needle and determine the maximum needle insertion depth. 9) We suggest that ultrasound be used to evaluate normal lung sliding pre- and postprocedure to rule out pneumothorax. 10) We suggest avoiding delay or interval change in patient position from the time of marking the needle insertion site to performing the thoracentesis. 11) We recommend against performing routine postprocedure chest radiographs in patients who have undergone thoracentesis successfully with ultrasound guidance and are asymptomatic with normal lung sliding postprocedure. 12) We recommend that novices who use ultrasound guidance for thoracentesis should receive focused training in lung and pleural ultrasonography and hands-on practice in procedural technique. 13) We suggest that novices undergo simulation-based training prior to performing ultrasound-guided thoracentesis on patients. 14) Learning curves for novices to become competent in lung ultrasound and ultrasound-guided thoracentesis are not completely understood, and we recommend that training should be tailored to the skill acquisition of the learner and the resources of the institution.

### Monitoring of clinical imaging guidelines part 3: norms, standards, and regulations [^115HGxYm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

It is known that the use of imaging in clinical situations is not always optimal, leading to suboptimal health care and potential radiation risk. There may be overuse of imaging, underuse, or use of the wrong modality. The use of clinical imaging guidelines is likely to improve the use of imaging, but roadblocks exist. Some of these relate to regulatory oversight and mandates. There is wide variation by country and region in the regulatory setting, ranging from actual absence of regulatory authorities to mandated availability of clinical imaging guidelines in the European Community. Collaborative efforts to ensure that clinical imaging guidelines are at least available is a good starting point. Regulatory oversight and support are necessary to ensure the use of clinical imaging guidelines. Regulations should address 3 areas: availability, clinical utilization, and adherence to and revision of guidelines. The use of both internal and external audits, with the aim of both use of and adherence to guidelines and quality improvement, is the best tool for enhancing use. The major challenges that need to be addressed, collaboratively, to ensure the dissemination and use of clinical imaging guidelines are the development of regulations, of regulatory structures that can be effectively deployed, and of benchmarks for adherence and for utility.

### Setting and monitoring of mechanical ventilation during venovenous ECMO [^113iQptD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Transpulmonary Pressure-Guided Strategy

Plateau pressure is a surrogate of the pressure gradient that stresses the lung, i.e. the transpulmonary pressure. As pleural pressure correlates with esophageal pressure, an esophageal manometer can be used to calculate the end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure. This pressure-guided strategy to optimize PEEP can limit atelectrauma and minimize the risk of lung overdistention. It has been used to identify candidates for ECMO (i.e. refractory hypoxemia despite optimal PEEP) or to optimize PEEP on ECMO. In this latter study, patients on VV-ECMO were randomized to either transpulmonary pressure-guided ventilation (n = 52) or a lung rest strategy (n = 52). The transpulmonary pressure-guided group had a higher rate of successful weaning, a significantly lower 60-day mortality rate (33% vs. 54%, p = 0.03), and shorter ECMO duration (p = 0.004) compared to the lung rest group. However, the transpulmonary pressure-guided strategy remains controversial in patients with ARDS and is not supported by the results of the EPVent-2 trial.

Other Methods

Lung ultrasound can be used to guide the setting of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients and assess bedside lung recruitment. Changes in the lung ultrasound score correlated with PEEP-induced increases in end-expiratory lung volume in a series of ARDS patients receiving conventional mechanical ventilation and also correlated significantly with computed tomography (CT) scan data in a series of 18 patients receiving ECMO.

The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio is a recent tool that has been developed to evaluate the potential for lung recruitment. It is calculated as the ratio between the compliance of the recruited lung following the application of a high PEEP to that of the respiratory system measured at a lower PEEP. This parameter can be easily measured at the bedside with any ICU ventilator and may help to optimize ventilator settings, particularly PEEP. As of today, this parameter has not been studied during ECMO with very low tidal volume.

### The safety of obstetrical ultrasound: a review [^112UtoUE]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is a commonly employed imaging modality in obstetrics and is generally regarded as safe to the fetus. Current ultrasound technology, however, has significantly higher output potential than older machines used in most clinical studies, and the safety profile for the increasing use of Doppler, 3-dimensional (D) and 4-D ultrasound with modern machines is unknown. This article reviews the current status of ultrasound safety within obstetrics, including proposed mechanisms of harm, existing scientific and clinical evidence regarding those mechanisms, and considerations of safety for the clinical user.

### American Society of Echocardiography consensus statement on the clinical applications of ultrasonic contrast agents in echocardiography [^116zeVYF]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Contrast echocardiography — ultrasound machine settings emphasize using "the low-MI preset provided by vendor of machine", that "MI ideally should be 0.15 to 0.3", and to "Optimize transmit focus location (usually far-field location at level of mitral valve plane)", "Optimize TGCs and gain", and "Minimize near-field gain". When "low-MI imaging presets are used for LVO", obscured endocardial borders are "managed by intermittent use of brief high-power frames ("flash" or "burst") to cause myocardial bubble depletion", resulting in "restoration of clear delineation between myocardium and LV cavity".

### Principles of safety for ultrasound-guided single injection blocks in the emergency department [^116GqhPh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks (UGNBs) allow emergency physicians an opportunity to provide optimal pain management for acute traumatic conditions. Over the past decade, a growing body of literature has detailed the novel ways clinicians have incorporated UGNBs for analgesia and an alternative to procedural sedation. UGNBs are considered a relatively safe procedure, and have been shown to increase rates of success and reduce complications (as compared to older techniques). Ultrasound allows the operator needle visualization and a clear anatomic overview. Even with the presumed level of increased safety, we recommend that any clinician who performs ultrasound-guided nerve blocks be aware of complications that could arise during and after the procedure. Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) post block, local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) and the role of single peripheral nerve blocks in patients with a risk for compartment syndrome are common safety issues discussed when performing ultrasound-guided nerve blocks.

### Point-of-care ultrasound: seeing the future [^113PWPT6]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Practitioners other than radiologists and certified sonographers are increasingly using ultrasound at the bedside to facilitate immediate patient management from both procedural and diagnostic standpoints. This editorial provides a brief overview of the use of point-of-care ultrasound in clinical practice, its potential to improve patient care, and some of the unanswered questions surrounding issues of training, scope of practice, and quality assurance.

### Combatting COVID-19: is ultrasound an important piece in the diagnostic puzzle? [^116n97BV]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The current COVID-19 pandemic is causing diagnostic and risk stratification difficulties in Emergency Departments (ED) worldwide. Molecular tests are not sufficiently sensitive, and results are usually not available in time for decision making in the ED. Chest x-ray (CXR) is a poor diagnostic test for COVID-19, and computed tomography (CT), while sensitive, is impractical as a diagnostic test for all patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has an established role in the evaluation of acute respiratory failure and has been used during the COVID-19 outbreak as a decision support tool. LUS shows characteristic changes in viral pneumonitis, and while these changes are not specific for COVID-19, it may be a useful adjunct during the diagnostic process. It is quick to perform and repeat and may be done at the bedside. The authors believe that LUS can help to mitigate uncertainty in undifferentiated patients with respiratory symptoms. This review aims to provide guidance regarding indications for LUS, describe the typical sonographic abnormalities seen in patients with COVID-19 and provide recommendations around the logistics of performing LUS on patients with COVID-19 and managing the infection control risk of the procedure. The risk of anchoring bias during a pandemic and the need to consider alternative pathologies are emphasised throughout this review. LUS may be a useful point-of-care test for emergency care providers during the current COVID-19 pandemic if used within a strict framework that governs education, quality assurance and proctored scanning protocols.

### Ultrasound anatomy of the transversus abdominis plane region in pregnant women before and after cesarean delivery [^111p1E8P]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

If the anesthetist decides to perform the TAP block after delivery it may be useful to perform an ultrasound examination of the abdominal wall preoperatively to minimize the time needed to establish the block after surgery, e.g. by preparing the ultrasound machines settings for focus depth and frequency. When employing this strategy one needs to keep in mind that, as seen in our study, the TAP shifts position after cesarean delivery. It is then found approximately 0.7 cm deeper in reference to the skin. Patient positioning also affects TAP depth, possibly because with left lateral displacement, the gravid uterus provides a firmer base for the ultrasound probe. Of note, we use 110 mm cornerstone needles for TAP blocks. With an angle of 45°, these would have been long enough for all studied patients.

The depth of the TAP depends on the body weight of the parturient. In patients with an increased BMI it can be expected to be observed deeper than average. The patient's body weight should be taken into account when planning a postoperative TAP block. The depth and the frequency of the transducer may need to be adjusted and more time may need to be allocated for the procedure. Additionally, the choice of needle length may need to be optimized in this way too.

For transverse abdominal incisions as in CD, TAP block needs to be performed on both sides to obtain a bilateral effect. Bilateral TAP injections of ropivacaine have been shown to achieve relevant plasma concentrations of local anesthetic 30 min after injection. Elevated plasma ropivacaine levels and symptoms of mild neurotoxicity have been observed after TAP block for cesarean sections. Individual dosing strategies should be applied to minimize the risk of potentially toxic plasma concentrations. Given the risk of relevant transfer of local anesthetic into the circulation, the sonographical anatomy of the TAP region should be judiciously visualized before puncture, while advancing the needle and during injection, in order to minimize the total applied dose of local anesthetic by poorly targeted injection. Also, patients must be monitored closely for at least 45 min after injection, as peak plasma concentration is reached about 30 min after injection. The main limitation of this observational sonoanatomical study is that no actual TAP blocks were performed.

### Information for practices… [^114qWk2J]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Benefits/Risks Ultrasound imaging has been used for over 20 years and has an excellent safety record. It is based on non-ionizing radiation, so it does not have the same risks as X-rays or other types of imaging systems that use ionizing radiation. In fetal ultrasound, three-dimensional ultrasound allows the visualization of some facial features and possibly other parts such as fingers and toes of the fetus. Four-dimensional ultrasound is 3D ultrasound in motion. While ultrasound is generally considered to be safe with very low risks, the risks may increase with unnecessary prolonged exposure to ultrasound energy, or when untrained users operate the device. Expectant mothers should also be aware of concerns with purchasing over-the-counter fetal heartbeat monitoring systems. These devices should only be used by trained health care providers when medically necessary.

Use of these devices by untrained persons could expose the fetus to prolonged and unsafe energy levels, or could provide information that is interpreted incorrectly by the user. Additional resources on ultrasound imaging:

- RadiologyInfo. org: Obstetrical Ultrasound
- **Image Gently**: The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging. Information for Health Care Providers As part of FDA's Initiative To Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure From Medical Imaging, FDA has recommended that health care providers consider examinations that use little or no ionizing radiation exposure, such as ultrasound or MRI, if medically appropriate. Ultrasound imaging does introduce energy into the body, and laboratory studies have shown that diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce physical effects in tissue, such as pressure oscillations with subsequent mechanical effects and rise in temperature.

Therefore, FDA recommends that health care providers consider ways to minimize exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality when using ultrasound. As with all other imaging modalities, the principles of As Low As Reasonably Achievable should be practiced by health care providers. Individual states regulate the use of diagnostic ultrasound through recommendations and requirements for personnel qualifications, quality assurance and quality control programs and facility accreditation. Information for Facilities Conducting Ultrasound Imaging Ultrasound practices should consider site and staff participation in voluntary accreditation and certification programs that address both safety and effectiveness of the device following the principles of As Low As Reasonably Achievable, such as those offered by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers.

Any health care facility employing ultrasound should conduct regular quality control tests to ensure that equipment is functioning properly.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^116nr9hD]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM Practice Parameter — ensuring optimal room setup advises that the patient is placed in a comfortable position to minimize movement, and when possible, the patient is placed on the examination table in a dependent position to reduce the risk of a vasovagal episode, particularly when long procedures are anticipated. Ideally, the examination table height should be adjustable, and the height of the table should be adjusted to a position of comfort for the clinician, and the target region should be adequately exposed. The clinician should be positioned on the same side as the target region, and the ultrasound machine should be placed such that the clinician can see the target region on the patient and the ultrasound screen with minimal head or neck movement. If possible, the ultrasound transducer should be held with the nondominant hand while the procedure is performed with the dominant hand.

### Demystifying volume status: an ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^116xtggE]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

As the number of POCUS applications expands and they become more advanced, the integration of multiorgan findings with a patient's unique physiologic features becomes increasingly complex, raising the risk of errors. Consequently, comprehensive training and oversight in POCUS training programs are essential. Research is needed to explore the clinical outcomes of POCUS-guided volume assessments in different disease states, supported by a systematic scanning protocol. These outcomes should be compared with existing noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring methods.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^114en35j]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM ultrasound-guided procedures — optimizing needle visualization emphasizes that while advancing the needle during an ultrasound-guided procedure, the performing clinician should maintain continuous, real-time visualization of the needle and its relationship with the target and surrounding structures. Coordinating transducer and needle positions is integral to maintaining optimal visualization, and if the transducer moves or the needle trajectory drifts out from under the transducer, needle visualization will be reduced. The clinician can minimize unwanted transducer risk by firmly anchoring the hand holding the transducer onto the patient, and needle and transducer control may be improved by supporting the elbows or forearms on the table. To relocate a lost needle or optimize visualization during real-time ultrasound guidance, the performing clinician may use one or more techniques, including transducer manipulation during the commonly used in-plane approach. For the translation maneuver, the transducer is perpendicular to the skin and is translated toward the needle until at least a portion of the needle is visualized on the screen; during translation, a jiggling maneuver is often performed to produce needle movement that can be detected on the screen, and if the direction of translation is correct the amplitude of detected motion will increase until the transducer lies over the needle, at which time the needle will appear on the screen.

### Targeted neonatal echocardiography in the neonatal intensive care unit: practice guidelines and recommendations for training. writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) in collaboration with the European association of echocardiography (EAE) and the association for European pediatric cardiologists (AEPC) [^117TbKTU]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Targeted neonatal echocardiography (TNE) technical and safety requirements — All ultrasound systems used for imaging neonatal hearts should include two-dimensional (2D), M-mode, and full Doppler capabilities and should display a simultaneous electrocardiographic tracing, and high-frequency probes (8–12 MHz) should be available on the machines used in the NICU. System settings should be optimized to image neonates and VLBW infants. When performing examinations on unstable infants, special precautions may need to be taken not to cause further cardiorespiratory instability in this population, including infection prevention where use of connecting cables from the monitoring equipment already in use to the ultrasound system, rather than placement of additional electrodes for electrocardiographic acquisition, should be considered whenever possible to minimize skin trauma, and therefore, it is recommended that individualized practice guidelines for infection prevention during echocardiographic studies be developed and that practitioners of TNE be aware of and adhere to local guidelines. During the scan, the infant should be kept warm, and body temperature should be monitored, warmed gel should be used to minimize the effect of direct skin cooling on the patient's body temperature, and opening of incubators should be kept at a minimum, with the use of portals designed for handling rather than unnecessary opening of the unit. The duration of scanning should be minimized, particularly in critically ill infants. Recommendations and best practices state: The ultrasound systems used for TNE should be optimized for imaging the neonatal heart, and when imaging a potentially unstable neonate or VLBW infant, special attention is required for the prevention of infection, maintenance of body temperature, and monitoring of cardiorespiratory function.
