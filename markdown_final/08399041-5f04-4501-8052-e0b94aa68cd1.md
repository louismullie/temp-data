## Question

medication for cocaine use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications for cocaine use disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical context, guideline stance, and evidence hierarchy. Then, I should verify which pharmacotherapies have explicit 2024 ASAM/AAAP recommendations and clarify any nuances or caveats. Next, I will examine the evidence profiles for topiramate, bupropion, and modafinil, including dosing signals and safety. After that, I will review other agents with notable data such as disulfiram, vigabatrin, tiagabine, and baclofen. I should then address special populations and comorbidities, outline a pragmatic clinical algorithm, and finally consider monitoring, duration, and research directions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidence priorities. There are still no FDA-approved medications for cocaine use disorder, so psychosocial treatments like contingency management and CBT remain foundational, but they are often insufficient alone, which motivates careful, evidence-based consideration of pharmacotherapy adjuncts in guidelines and systematic reviews, with a focus on high-credibility sources and recent meta-analyses to guide practice decisions [^112EJeFX] [^114Tit37] [^116vP7Gw].

> I need to verify what the 2024 ASAM/AAAP guideline actually recommends. Hold on, I should confirm the exact wording: the guideline states to consider offering topiramate to reduce cocaine use, bupropion to promote abstinence, and modafinil to reduce use and improve retention, with the important qualifier that modafinil should be considered only when there is no comorbid alcohol use disorder, which is a recommendation rather than a formal contraindication; wait, I initially said "contraindicated", but I should correct myself to "avoid in the presence of alcohol use disorder per guideline caution", not a labeled contraindication [^112EJeFX] [^116cWrvR] [^116VvT1N].

> Now, topiramate: I will examine the strength of evidence and dosing. A 2016 meta-analysis found no benefit for retention but did find increased continuous abstinence in two studies, suggesting a signal for efficacy despite heterogeneity; meanwhile, a 12-week randomized trial in JAMA Psychiatry showed a significant increase in cocaine non-use days during weeks 6–12, which suggests benefits may emerge only after several weeks and at higher maintenance doses; wait, I initially said "titrate to 200 mg/day", but the JAMA trial used a target of 300 mg/day, so clinically I should acknowledge that effective dosing ranges from 200–300 mg/day with slow titration to mitigate cognitive side effects and paresthesias [^115i5Q4Q] [^113Lt22s].

> Next, bupropion: let me check the magnitude of effect and when it's most useful. The 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis identified increased abstinence with bupropion across two RCTs, and the 2024 ASAM/AAAP guideline recommends considering bupropion to promote abstinence, particularly when comorbid depression is present or abstinence is a primary goal; I should confirm that antidepressants as a class have been broadly negative, so this is likely a medication-specific, not class-wide, signal [^116vP7Gw] [^116cWrvR].

> Modafinil requires careful nuance. I need to double-check trial consistency and subgroup findings. A large randomized trial showed no overall effect on cocaine non-use days but did reveal a post-hoc improvement among those with comorbid alcohol dependence, whereas the 2024 guideline advises considering modafinil only in the absence of alcohol use disorder; hold on, this is a potential tension, so the safest interpretation is that despite the subgroup signal, the guideline's population-level recommendation is to avoid modafinil when alcohol use disorder is present, and to consider 200–400 mg/day in selected patients without alcohol comorbidity, mindful of stimulant-like properties but relatively low abuse liability in trials [^116Z9o5q] [^116VvT1N] [^113pvoCB].

> Let me now scrutinize disulfiram, where guidance and evidence have evolved. Earlier BAP guidance labeled the evidence as insufficient, but the updated 2024 Cochrane review concludes disulfiram may increase abstinence versus placebo, and BAP specifically recommends disulfiram, alone or with naltrexone, for patients with concurrent alcohol and cocaine use; I should also note the dose-dependent effect seen in methadone-stabilized patients where 250 mg/day was effective while lower doses paradoxically worsened outcomes, so I need to ensure dosing is correct and hepatic monitoring is in place [^111rh3xV] [^117T5CCL] [^114684wy] [^113XLEJs].

> I will now examine other agents with notable but inconsistent or limited data. Vigabatrin demonstrated a robust abstinence signal in a 9-week randomized trial among parolees, but concerns about retinal toxicity and limited replication have constrained uptake, which means it may be reserved for highly selected settings with ophthalmologic monitoring if considered at all; tiagabine showed increased cocaine-free urines in a small methadone-maintained pilot but failed to show global benefits in larger studies; baclofen showed a positive signal in one RCT but was negative in a larger multicenter trial, implying no general recommendation outside of research or narrowly defined subgroups [^111B9GV6] [^111fqD8v] [^1144z9vE] [^117H2etd].

> But wait, what about truly emerging options with mechanistic promise. A single infusion of ketamine combined with mindfulness-based relapse prevention improved abstinence and delayed relapse in a small RCT, suggesting a neuroplasticity-facilitated synergy with behavioral therapy; vaccines like TA-CD generate cocaine-specific antibodies that blunt euphoria with dose-dependent antibody responses but remain investigational; GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide have early human feasibility and safety data with mixed signals on use, requiring randomized trials before any clinical use [^116QnpEG] [^113zvRu1] [^115QoiK8] [^115hjvoj].

> I need to address special populations and comorbidities to avoid overgeneralization. For concurrent alcohol and cocaine use disorders, disulfiram is a reasonable pharmacologic option supported by BAP and consistent with Cochrane's suggestion of increased abstinence, whereas modafinil should be avoided given the 2024 guideline qualifier; for co-occurring opioid use disorder, BAP guidance indicates insufficient evidence to prefer methadone versus buprenorphine for reducing cocaine use and insufficient evidence to add bupropion, desipramine, amantadine, or gabapentin to opioid maintenance, although a small tiagabine pilot suggested possible benefit in methadone-maintained patients that has not been replicated [^114684wy] [^117T5CCL] [^116VvT1N] [^116nT1dR] [^112bR4Qs] [^111fqD8v].

> Now, let me synthesize this into a practical clinical algorithm. Foundation first: all patients should receive evidence-based psychosocial treatment, with contingency management and CBT as the backbone, and pharmacotherapy considered as an adjunct in alignment with the 2024 ASAM/AAAP guidance and meta-analytic signals; for initial medication choices, topiramate or bupropion are reasonable options individualized to patient goals and comorbidities, and modafinil can be considered in carefully selected patients without alcohol use disorder who need help with retention or craving, always layered on top of psychosocial care rather than replacing it [^112EJeFX] [^114Tit37] [^116vP7Gw] [^116VvT1N].

> Hold on, I should be explicit about dosing and safety within that algorithm. For topiramate, I will titrate slowly toward 200–300 mg/day over several weeks given that benefits often emerge after week 6 and cognitive side effects are dose-related; for bupropion, sustained-release or extended-release formulations can be chosen with attention to insomnia or anxiety; for modafinil, 200–400 mg/day may be used in selected patients without alcohol comorbidity, with monitoring for sleep disruption and blood pressure changes; and for disulfiram in alcohol-plus-cocaine use, 250 mg/day with hepatic monitoring is prudent, avoiding lower subtherapeutic doses that may worsen outcomes, while reserving vigabatrin to specialized settings given safety constraints [^113Lt22s] [^115i5Q4Q] [^116vP7Gw] [^116VvT1N] [^113XLEJs] [^111B9GV6].

> I should confirm monitoring, duration, and combination principles. Regular urine drug testing, craving assessments, and side-effect checks are essential, with a treatment window of at least 12 weeks to detect delayed-onset benefits such as those seen with topiramate in weeks 6–12; combining multiple medications lacks evidence and is not routinely recommended, whereas combining a single pharmacotherapy with robust psychosocial treatment is guideline-concordant and more likely to yield benefit, with referral to clinical trials for ketamine or vaccine approaches when feasible [^113Lt22s] [^112EJeFX] [^116QnpEG] [^113zvRu1].

> Finally, let me step back and ensure the conclusions are balanced and precise. Current best evidence supports considering topiramate and bupropion as first-line adjuncts based on patient characteristics, while modafinil is a selective option in the absence of alcohol use disorder; disulfiram is particularly relevant for patients with concurrent alcohol use disorder, with careful dosing and monitoring; other agents like vigabatrin, tiagabine, and baclofen have inconsistent or safety-limited profiles that confine them to research or highly selected contexts; and all pharmacotherapy should be delivered alongside evidence-based psychosocial interventions while we continue to pursue larger definitive RCTs and precision approaches that match treatments to patient phenotypes [^112EJeFX] [^116vP7Gw] [^117T5CCL] [^114684wy] [^116VvT1N].

There are **no FDA-approved medications** for cocaine use disorder [^116vP7Gw], but modafinil [^116VvT1N], topiramate [^112EJeFX], and bupropion [^116cWrvR] are recommended by AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines as options to consider for reducing cocaine use and improving abstinence. Disulfiram may help in patients with **co-occurring alcohol use disorder** [^117T5CCL] [^114684wy], while antipsychotics and antidepressants are not recommended due to lack of efficacy [^116Xc1D2] [^116YTwpX]. Emerging treatments such as ketamine [^116QnpEG], GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115hjvoj], and cocaine vaccines [^115QoiK8] are under investigation but not yet approved. Medications should be combined with behavioral therapies [^116qWQvM] like CBT and **contingency management** for optimal outcomes [^111NdVk6].

## Current pharmacological treatments

### Psychostimulants

Among psychostimulants, **modafinil** is recommended by AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines to reduce cocaine use and improve treatment retention [^113pvoCB] [^116VvT1N], particularly in patients without co-occurring alcohol use disorder. The guidelines also recommend **bupropion** to promote cocaine abstinence [^116cWrvR] [^116vP7Gw].

---

### Anticonvulsants

Among anticonvulsants, **topiramate** is recommended by AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines to reduce cocaine use [^113Lt22s] [^115i5Q4Q] [^112EJeFX].

---

### Disulfiram

Disulfiram may be considered [^117T5CCL] — particularly in patients with **co-occurring alcohol use disorder** [^114684wy] — although evidence is mixed [^111rh3xV].

---

## Medications not recommended

Medications not recommended include **antipsychotics** [^116Xc1D2] and **antidepressants** [^116YTwpX] due to lack of efficacy.

---

## Emerging pharmacological treatments

Several **novel pharmacological treatments** are under investigation:

- **Ketamine**: A single infusion combined with mindfulness-based behavioral modification has shown promise [^116QnpEG] in reducing cocaine use and relapse in preliminary studies.

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: exenatide has shown feasibility and safety in preliminary studies [^115hjvoj], but further research is needed.

- **Cocaine vaccines**: Vaccines such as TA-CD are being investigated [^113zvRu1] to elicit antibodies that block cocaine's pharmacological effects, but challenges remain in achieving consistent antibody responses [^115QoiK8].

---

## Combination therapies

Combination therapies that integrate pharmacological and behavioral interventions have shown promise in improving outcomes [^111NdVk6]. These include **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** — effective in reducing cocaine use and relapse when combined with medications — and **contingency management** [^116qWQvM], which provides tangible rewards for abstinence and enhances adherence and outcomes [^111gSv81].

---

## Safety and side effects

Pharmacological treatments for cocaine use disorder have varying **safety profiles** and potential side effects:

- **Modafinil**: Generally well-tolerated [^113pvoCB], but may cause insomnia, headache, and anxiety [^116Z9o5q].

- **Topiramate**: May cause cognitive impairment, dizziness, and paresthesia [^113Lt22s].

- **Disulfiram**: Can cause adverse reactions, particularly when combined with alcohol [^117T5CCL].

---

## Conclusion

There are currently **no FDA-approved medications** for cocaine use disorder [^116vP7Gw]. However, recent guidelines recommend **modafinil** [^116VvT1N], **topiramate** [^112EJeFX], and **bupropion** [^116cWrvR]. Emerging treatments — such as ketamine [^116QnpEG], GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115hjvoj], and cocaine vaccines [^115QoiK8] — are under investigation. Combination strategies that integrate pharmacological and behavioral interventions are promising [^111NdVk6].

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114Tit37]. Addiction (2021). High credibility.

More than 18 million people worldwide use cocaine, and 16% of them will develop a cocaine use disorder (CUD). Given its association with high rates of health and social problems, together with premature mortality, CUD has become a public health issue. An important factor predicting relapse is the intense desire (craving) to use cocaine. CUD and related craving are mainly managed with psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy and contingency management. These strategies alone are often insufficient to induce behavioural changes or a reduction in cocaine use and relapse.

Several systematic reviews on CUD pharmacological treatments found weak efficacy evidence to improve cocaine craving and time to relapse. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify novel treatments to help individuals with CUD. Pre-clinical findings suggesting that cannabinoids may decrease drug use have motivated an enthusiastic call for research into cannabidiol (CBD) as a promising intervention for CUD.

CBD has a favorable tolerability profile together with numerous physiological and neuroprotective properties. For example, it protects against cocaine-induced seizures and hepatotoxicity in animals. Moreover, CBD possesses anxiolytic properties in clinical populations and can decrease autonomic arousal. This is important, as stress is a potent cocaine-craving inducer and a potential target for new addiction interventions. The exact mechanism by which CBD impacts cocaine use is still unknown, but several have been hypothesized, such as hippocampal neurogenesis.

### Understanding polydrug use: Review of heroin and cocaine co-use [^1123YFZD]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Use of cocaine by heroin-dependent individuals, or by patients in methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment, is substantial and has negative consequences on health, social adjustment, and the outcome of opioid-addiction treatment. The pharmacological reasons for cocaine use in opioid-dependent individuals, however, are poorly understood, and little is known about the patterns of heroin and cocaine co-use. We reviewed anecdotal evidence suggesting that cocaine is co-used with opioid drugs in various patterns to achieve different goals.

Clinical and preclinical experimental evidence indicates that the simultaneous administration of cocaine and heroin (i.e. 'speedball') does not induce a novel set of subjective effects, nor is it more reinforcing than either drug alone, especially when the doses of heroin and cocaine are high. There is mixed evidence that the subjective effects of cocaine are enhanced in individuals dependent on opioids. However, it is clear that cocaine can alleviate the severity of symptoms of withdrawal from opioids.

We also reviewed preclinical studies investigating possible neurobiological interactions between opioids and cocaine. The results of these studies have been difficult to interpret, mainly because the neurochemical mechanisms mediating the motivational effects of cocaine are modified by dependence on, and withdrawal from, opioid drugs.

Our analysis encourages further systematic investigation of cocaine use patterns among opioid-dependent individuals and in laboratory animals.

### Clinical management of psychostimulant withdrawal: Review of the evidence [^111AV8XS]. Addiction (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that a majority of people who use psychostimulants, particularly methamphetamine (MA) and cocaine, experience withdrawal upon abstinence from sustained use. This review of clinical research reports the evidence regarding biomedical and behavioral treatments for psychostimulant withdrawal symptoms. It provides a framework for clinicians and scientists to increase impact on attenuating MA and cocaine withdrawal during initial and sustained abstinence.

Articles reviewed included reports of controlled clinical trials (randomized or non-randomized) that address at least one withdrawal symptom among the outcomes or specifically study patients in withdrawal. Potential efficacy for MA withdrawal is noted for a few medications, namely mirtazapine, naltrexone, and bupropion, as well as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during acute (first week), early protracted (weeks 2–4), and late protracted (> 4 weeks) withdrawal phases. Topiramate shows mixed evidence of efficacy for cocaine withdrawal. In general, there is an inconsistent signal for biomedical and behavioral treatments on MA and cocaine withdrawal.

### Cocaine rapid efficacy screening trial (CREST): A paradigm for the controlled evaluation of candidate medications for cocaine dependence [^114HKZ9t]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Development of effective medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence remains a major priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health. The Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trial (CREST) paradigm was developed by the Division of Treatment Research and Development (DT R&D) at NIDA with the goal of enhancing pilot clinical trial validity when systematically assessing a range of medications and drug classes for potential utility in the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Design**: CREST utilizes a randomized, controlled, parallel group, blinded methodology for comparing one or more marketed medications against a standard, pharmaceutical grade placebo. The trial design is comprised of a flexible 24-week screening/baseline period followed by randomization to an 8-week treatment period.

- **Measures**: Standard measures of outcomes for the CREST included urinary benzoylecgonine (primary metabolite of cocaine), retention, cocaine craving, depression, clinical global impression, and HIV-risk behaviors. Standardized procedures, measures, and psychosocial counseling were used to facilitate comparisons of data from the CREST studies across sites, drug classes, and time.

- **Results**: A total of 19 medications were evaluated in outpatient treatment research clinics in Boston, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia.

- **Conclusions**: Findings supported decisions to move forward three medications (cabergoline, reserpine, tiagabine) using full-scale, adequately powered, randomized placebo-controlled trial designs. Lessons learned from the study provide valuable insights for future research efforts.

### Feasibility of exenatide, a GLP-1R agonist, for treating cocaine use disorder: A case series study [^115hjvoj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Cocaine use remains a serious public health problem associated with a marked increase in overdose deaths over the past decade. No medications have yet been proven effective for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD). Among the highly promising medications are glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), which are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight management. Preclinically, GLP-1RAs have been shown to attenuate cocaine self-administration. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in a human laboratory study. The GLP-1RA extended-release exenatide is administered as a once-weekly injection, which may be clinically advantageous for addressing medication nonadherence among individuals with CUD.

In this study, we assess feasibility and safety by reporting on three cases of patients with CUD who received exenatide 2 mg subcutaneously once weekly for six weeks in an open-label fashion, along with standard individual drug counseling. We observed excellent attendance and compliance, along with positive end-of-study satisfaction ratings. The medication was well tolerated without unexpected or severe adverse events. Results for cocaine use and related clinical effects were more mixed, yet encouraging. Future empirical testing of exenatide for treating CUD should utilize a randomized controlled trial design and longer treatment duration.

### Pharmacotherapies for cocaine dependence [^112tnaeu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2000). Low credibility.

This article reviews the history of pharmacologic trials for the treatment of cocaine dependence as well as treatments under investigation. The rationale for the use of agents such as dopaminergic agents, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants is discussed. Early clinical trials with pharmacologic agents have demonstrated both positive and negative results; the possible reasons for these mixed outcomes are also discussed. Recent studies focusing on disulfiram, dopamine-selective antagonists, citicoline, aspirin, and a cocaine-specific vaccine are presented to highlight innovative and potentially effective treatments for individuals with cocaine dependence.

### Pharmacological treatment of cocaine dependence: A systematic review [^116tpbom]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, associated with severe medical, psychological, and social problems, including the spread of infectious diseases. This systematic review critically assesses the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Methods**: The literature search strategy included electronic searches of Cochrane Library holdings, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, Biological Abstracts, and LILACS. It also involved scans of reference lists of relevant articles, personal communications, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on the use of antidepressants (ADs), carbamazepine (CBZ), dopamine agonists (DAs), and other drugs used in the treatment of cocaine dependence were included. The reviewers extracted data independently, and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Qualitative assessments were carried out using a Cochrane validated checklist. Where possible, analysis was conducted according to 'intention-to-treat' principles.

- **Findings**: The search strategy generated 45 different trials. Most studied drugs were ADs (20 studies), DAs, and CBZ. Data were very heterogeneous, with dropout rates within the studies ranging from 0 to 84%. A non-significant trend favoring CBZ was found in terms of dropouts (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75–1.03), and results from one trial suggest that fluoxetine patients are less likely to drop out. The main efficacy outcome reported in the studies was the presence of cocaine met.

### Disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence [^117T5CCL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine is a psychostimulant used by approximately 0.4% of the general population worldwide. Cocaine dependence is a chronic mental disorder characterized by the inability to control cocaine use and a host of severe medical and psychosocial complications. There is no approved pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence. Some researchers have proposed disulfiram, a medication approved to treat alcohol use disorder. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Search methods**: We updated our searches of the following databases to August 2022: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via two trials registries. The references of topic-related systematic reviews and included studies were handsearched. There were no language restrictions in the searches.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated disulfiram alone or associated with psychosocial interventions versus placebo, no intervention, other pharmacological interventions, or any psychosocial intervention for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies (1191 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Disulfiram compared to placebo may increase the number of people who are abstinent.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^1144z9vE]. BMC Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Valproate, which enhances GABA levels by increasing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity and inhibiting GABA transaminase activity, was examined in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a within-subjects, crossover study design to assess its effect on cue-induced cocaine craving. Subjects identified as crack cocaine dependent (N = 20) were titrated to 1,500 mg/day of valproate and subsequently exposed to a series of neutral and cocaine-related cues. Interestingly, under treatment conditions with valproate, participants reported higher craving (i.e. 'desire to use now') in response to cue exposure when compared to the placebo condition. Due to the limited sample size, further research on this medication may still be warranted.

Tiagabine, a GABA reuptake inhibitor, has been examined in two recent human clinical trials. In an earlier RCT (N = 141), the group receiving tiagabine (20 mg/day) did not differ significantly from placebo in terms of cocaine craving and global function. Additionally, there was no significant change in cocaine use in either the study or placebo groups. A later study compared the impact of tiagabine versus lorazepam, a benzodiazepine and GABA-enhancing medication, and placebo. The authors found that tiagabine increased slow-wave sleep by three times in those recently establishing abstinence from cocaine use. Importantly, tiagabine did not differ from placebo regarding impact on cognitive function (i.e. vigilance task, measures of impulsivity), while lorazepam was found to cause next-day impairment. There may be a possible indication for tiagabine in the period of early abstinence from cocaine use.

### BAP updated guidelines: Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: Recommendations from BAP [^116nT1dR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, specifically in patients with opioid use disorder, the BAP 2012 guidelines recommend insufficient evidence to favor either methadone maintenance therapy or buprenorphine maintenance therapy for patients using both opioids and cocaine.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^111ZyEwQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a stimulant that leads to the rapid accumulation of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain due to the prevention of their re-uptake into the neuron that released the neurotransmitter. Cocaine dependence is a public health concern and a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, there are no approved medications for the treatment of this devastating illness, and behavioral interventions have proven to be of limited use. However, several recent trials have tested promising agents, including dopamine agonists, GABAergic medications, and the cocaine vaccine.

Here, we discuss the most recent human clinical trials of potential medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence, as well as preclinical studies for another promising agent, levo-tetrahydropalmatine. Examination of these recent findings shows promise for GABAergic medications and the cocaine vaccine, as well as unique medications such as disulfiram, whose mechanism remains to be determined. Future work may also confirm specific subgroups of patients for treatment response based on clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and pharmacogenetics. This review highlights the need for further, larger studies in order to determine optimal clinical usage.

### Use of stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine abuse [^112E44YZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The concept of using stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence is largely based on the "replacement" therapy model that has shown efficacy for treating nicotine and opiate dependence. Although results have been mixed, some evidence supports using stimulant medication to reduce cocaine use. There are not enough data at the time of writing to determine the efficacy of stimulants for methamphetamine dependence. Drawbacks of stimulants as treatments include the potential for abuse of the treatment, which necessitates careful screening and monitoring of patients. Possible reasons for the efficacy of stimulants include enhancement of monoamine function dysregulated by chronic cocaine or methamphetamine use. Newer medications that enhance dopamine function but lack the abuse potential of older stimulants are being studied. It is hoped that these medications will provide safe and effective treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine dependence, but more research on this topic is needed.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor controls neural and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine [^116zF5cR]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Drug addiction is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by dysregulated drug intake, enhanced motivation to both seek and take drugs, persistent use despite negative consequences, and recurring cycles of abstinence and relapse. Treatment of addiction to psychostimulants such as cocaine has proven particularly difficult despite extensive work characterizing the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and neuronal signaling cascades underlying the neurobiology of cocaine use. Even with our advances in knowledge, targeting these systems clinically in cocaine use disorder has proven to be difficult for several reasons, including problems with side effects, routes of delivery, or abuse potential of agents tested. Thus, currently there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for treatment of psychostimulant use disorders.

Studies of patients with cocaine use disorders have shown dysregulation of multiple peripheral cytokines — some of which correlate with the extent of drug use — and addicts show altered immune system reactivity in response to drug cues. While cocaine and other abused drugs are known to have effects on immune system functioning, only recently have studies begun to examine the mechanistic link between altered immune function and pathological substance use behaviors. Here, we aimed to define the complex interaction between cocaine use and cytokine signaling and how these factors alter reward, motivation, and economic decision-making to drive cocaine addiction.

To this end, we characterize the regulation of innate immune system effector proteins in mice.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^113zvRu1]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Substance abuse vaccines represent an exciting area of promise in the treatment of chemical dependency. The introduction of these agents into our pharmacologic armamentarium represents an important shift in our conceptualization of drug use, as it posits substances of abuse as agents 'foreign' to the body and susceptible to immunologic mechanisms. Currently, clinical trials for vaccines treating both cocaine and nicotine dependence are ongoing, with vaccines for methamphetamine and heroin in preclinical development stages.

- **Cocaine vaccine**: The cocaine vaccine, TA-CD, is composed of a cocaine hapten conjugated to inactivated cholera toxin B, resulting in the creation of a molecule capable of stimulating an antibody response. These antibodies are cocaine-specific; ingestion of the substance by any means (intranasal, inhalational, intravenous) results in its binding and the creation of immune complexes unable to cross the blood-brain barrier due to their relatively larger size. These molecules are then broken down by cholinesterases in the circulation, converting the cocaine into inactive metabolites that are then excreted.

In a phase I clinical study (N = 34), participants receiving TA-CD were able to mount an immunologic response resulting in the creation of cocaine-specific antibodies. Subjects reported a reduction in the subjective effects and euphoria from smoked cocaine. Similarly, positive findings were observed during a phase II clinical study of two dose levels (100 µg × 4 injections, or 400 µg × 5 injections). Subjects receiving the higher dose displayed a more pronounced response.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^111BzJNp]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

These prospects in the pharmacologic management of cocaine dependence have demonstrated in human clinical trials an ability to reduce subjective reward, craving, and withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine use; however, there is still much progress to be made before they become viable widespread treatments. Of the dopamine agonist medications, although they have been shown to decrease euphoric and, in some cases, withdrawal symptoms, concerns regarding the addictive liability of amphetamine-type medications continue to limit widespread acceptance and use of this treatment.

Furthermore, findings in clinical trials of GABAergic medications have been less clear in demonstrating significant efficacy in treating cocaine dependence. They have shown some ability to reduce cocaine craving or to improve sleep duration and quality in those recently abstaining from cocaine. Cocaine abusers with comorbid alcohol dependence may represent a subpopulation particularly responsive to the effects of GVG. The cocaine vaccine, TA-CD, has demonstrated the ability to elicit an immunologic response capable of reducing the subjective reward of cocaine use in both animals and humans. These results make immunologic treatment of substance use disorders an exciting direction for the treatment of not only cocaine dependence but other substances as well. Finally, findings from preclinical trials for l-THP suggest that this medication, already used for centuries as an herbal remedy for other disorders, may be helpful in reducing cocaine dependence.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor controls neural and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine [^1134coM1]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Cocaine addiction is characterized by dysfunction in reward-related brain circuits, leading to maladaptive motivation to seek and take the drug. There are currently no clinically available pharmacotherapies to treat cocaine addiction. Through a broad screen of innate immune mediators, we identify granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a potent mediator of cocaine-induced adaptations. Here we report that G-CSF potentiates cocaine-induced increases in neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex.

In addition, G-CSF injections potentiate cocaine place preference and enhance motivation to self-administer cocaine, while not affecting responses to natural rewards. Infusion of G-CSF neutralizing antibody into NAc blocks the ability of G-CSF to modulate cocaine's behavioral effects, providing a direct link between central G-CSF action in NAc and cocaine reward. These results demonstrate that manipulating G-CSF is sufficient to alter the motivation for cocaine, but not natural rewards, providing a pharmacotherapeutic avenue to manipulate addictive behaviors without abuse potential.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^1129BTiz]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The final GABAergic medication to have been recently tested in a human clinical study is topiramate, which, in addition to potentiation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated input, antagonizes glutamatergic afferents to the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system. Kampman et al. demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of cocaine dependence in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (N = 40). Over the first eight weeks of the study, topiramate was titrated by 25 mg/week to a target dose of 200 mg/day. During that period, topiramate did not demonstrate a statistically significant ability to reduce cocaine use. After week eight, topiramate-treated subjects were more likely to be abstinent from cocaine compared to placebo, as measured by twice-weekly urine benzoylecgonine tests (UBT).

In an open-label, outpatient study of cocaine-dependent men (N = 28), participants received topiramate, ranging in dose from 25 to 300 mg/day. Interestingly, the only statistically significant finding of the study was a decrease in craving intensity, although this effect was seen in only 25% of participants. Further study of topiramate in a larger, placebo-controlled RCT is necessary to determine the extent of this medication's impact on craving. Additionally, the incorporation of genetic analysis into future trials might help determine underlying differences in subgroups of patients and provide clues regarding differential response patterns.

### Medication development for addictive disorders: The state of the science [^111gSv81]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

In 1989, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established its Medications Development Program. This program has concentrated on developing pharmacotherapies for opiate and cocaine dependence and, more recently, for methamphetamine and cannabis dependence. The major goals of this program are to optimize existing treatments and to expand treatment options for physicians and patients. This review will concentrate on the development of pharmacotherapies for the following substance abuse disorders: opiate, cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis dependence.

Left untreated, opiate and stimulant dependence are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. For example, the use of illicit opiates is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis C infection, HIV infection, and other medical consequences, such as overdose. The NIDA Medications Development Program has had success in developing, with pharmaceutical partners, levomethadyl acetate, buprenorphine, and buprenorphine/naloxone for opiate dependence. Moreover, several marketed medications have shown promise in reducing cocaine use. Of interest, these medications likely operate through diverse neurochemical mechanisms, suggesting that combination therapy may be a rational next step that could further increase treatment gains in cocaine-dependent patients.

The Medications Development Program has also identified multiple neuronal mechanisms that are altered by chronic administration of drugs of abuse. Advances in neuroscience have identified changes in conditioned cueing, drug priming, and stress-induced increases in drug seeking behavior.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^117H2etd]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, is widely used as a treatment for spasticity and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical trials for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In various rat studies, baclofen showed the ability to reduce cocaine self-administration, cocaine-induced reinstatement, cocaine-seeking behaviors, and cocaine-induced release of dopamine (DA) in the shell of the nucleus accumbens.

In an earlier double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (N = 70), Shoptaw et al. found that administration of baclofen (20 mg three times a day) resulted in statistically significant reductions in cocaine use compared to placebo. Although baclofen did not demonstrate a statistically significant impact on cocaine craving, participants were more likely to submit cocaine-negative urine samples between weeks three to eight of treatment. This finding may suggest the possible utility of this medication for those needing assistance with relapse prevention rather than abstinence initiation. The authors also examined the impact of baseline cocaine use levels on treatment outcomes, finding that those with a more severe form of cocaine dependence were more likely to respond to baclofen treatment.

A more recent multisite, double-blind RCT assessed the safety and efficacy of 60 mg baclofen treatment in 160 subjects diagnosed with severe cocaine dependence. The groups (treatment versus placebo) did not differ in terms of treatment retention rates or change in the mean weekly percentage of cocaine non-use days. The limited success of baclofen may be due to its use in specific subpopulations or other underlying factors.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vigabatrin for the treatment of cocaine dependence in Mexican parolees [^111B9GV6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). High credibility.

Cocaine dependence is associated with severe medical, psychiatric, and social morbidity, but no pharmacotherapy is approved for its treatment in the United States. The atypical antiepileptic vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) has shown promise in animal studies and open-label trials. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of vigabatrin for short-term cocaine abstinence in cocaine-dependent individuals.

Participants were treatment-seeking parolees who were actively using cocaine and had a history of cocaine dependence. Subjects were randomly assigned to a fixed titration of vigabatrin (N = 50) or placebo (N = 53) in a 9-week double-blind trial and 4-week follow-up assessment. Cocaine use was determined by directly observed urine toxicology testing twice weekly. The primary endpoint was full abstinence for the last 3 weeks of the trial.

Full end-of-trial abstinence was achieved in 14 vigabatrin-treated subjects (28.0%) versus four subjects in the placebo arm (7.5%). Twelve subjects in the vigabatrin group and two subjects in the placebo group maintained abstinence through the follow-up period. The retention rate was 62.0% in the vigabatrin arm versus 41.5% in the placebo arm. Among subjects who reported prestudy alcohol use, vigabatrin, relative to placebo, was associated with superior self-reported full end-of-trial abstinence from alcohol (43.5% versus 6.3%). There were no differences between the two groups in drug craving, depressed mood, anxiety, or Clinical Global Impression scores.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^113pvoCB]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Modafinil is a novel stimulant-like medication that promotes wakefulness and serves as a treatment for hypersomnia and narcolepsy. The mechanism of action is only partially understood at this time; however, there is evidence that this agent acts as a central alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, reduces basal cerebral GABA activity, and increases both dopamine and glutamate release in select areas of the brain. Chronic cocaine use results in a hypodopaminergic state as well as depletion of both extracellular glutamate levels and glutamatergic synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens. These neurotransmitter systems serve as the principal targets of modafinil's effects, and promising results in human clinical trials for treatment of cocaine dependence have been observed.

The safety of co-administration of modafinil and cocaine was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 10) conducted by Dackis et al. Modafinil demonstrated no significant exacerbating effects on vital sign measures or electrocardiogram (EKG) findings. As a secondary measure, pretreatment with modafinil at two oral dosages (200 mg and 400 mg, respectively) demonstrated an ability to significantly attenuate euphoria from intravenously administered cocaine in one subjective measure (P = 0.02). Importantly, this early study suggested safety as well as the possibility of a cocaine-blunting effect with modafinil.

In addition to examining the impact of modafinil on the euphorigenic effects of cocaine, early research focused on the similarity of modafinil to stimulant medications in order to…

### Determining a diagnostic cut-off on the severity of dependence scale (SDS) for cocaine dependence [^112ZTnEg]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) as a diagnostic measure of cocaine dependence and determine the cut-off score that best discriminates between the presence and absence of a DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional survey.
- **Setting**: Sydney, Australia.
- **Participants**: One hundred and forty-two cocaine users.
- **Measurements**: The diagnostic performance of the SDS was measured via ROC analysis against DSM-IV diagnoses of cocaine dependence, as measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
- **Findings**: ROC analysis revealed the SDS to be a test of high diagnostic utility for the measurement of cocaine dependence. The cut-off point on the SDS at which there is optimal discrimination between the presence and absence of a DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence was found to be 3 (i.e. a score of 3 or more).

The study statistically validated the utility of the SDS as a diagnostic measure of cocaine dependence and has determined an appropriate cut-off point. The SDS is recommended as a brief screening instrument for cocaine dependence that can be used in addition to more comprehensive measures, such as the CIDI.

### Recent advances in the pharmacotherapy of cocaine dependence [^1168QmxZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacotherapy of cocaine dependence is a rapidly developing field of research that may soon produce efficacious medications. Expanding research on reward-related brain circuitry, which is acutely activated and chronically dysregulated by cocaine, has helped reveal the neurobiological features of cocaine dependence and is guiding pharmacologic strategies that have significant potential to improve clinical outcomes. Cocaine dependence is a multifaceted disorder with distinct clinical components that may respond to different pharmacologic approaches.

Pharmacologic strategies for this disorder include blocking euphoria, reducing withdrawal and negative mood symptoms, ameliorating craving, and enhancing the prefrontal cortical function that seems to be impaired in cocaine-dependent patients. One medication may not be sufficient to treat these diverse elements of cocaine dependence because preliminary studies report efficacy with medications that have opposite actions on reward-related circuits. This review highlights pertinent advances in cocaine neurobiology, recent clinical trials, and controversies in the pharmacologic treatment of cocaine dependence.

### Topiramate for the treatment of cocaine addiction: A randomized clinical trial [^113Lt22s]. JAMA Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

No medication has been established as an efficacious treatment for cocaine dependence. We hypothesized that dual modulation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system by topiramate — a glutamate receptor antagonist and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist — would result in efficacious treatment for cocaine dependence compared with placebo.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy of topiramate vs. placebo as a treatment for cocaine dependence.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial conducted on 142 cocaine-dependent adults at clinical research facilities at the University of Virginia between November 22, 2005, and July 25, 2011.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either topiramate (n = 71) or placebo (n = 71) in escalating doses from 50 mg/d to the target maintenance dose of 300 mg/d during weeks 6 to 12. This was combined with weekly cognitive-behavioral treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: During the efficacy period, weeks 6 to 12, the primary outcome measured was the weekly difference from baseline in the proportion of cocaine nonuse days. The secondary outcome was urinary cocaine-free weeks, and exploratory outcomes included craving and self- and observer-rated global functioning on the Clinical Global Impression scales.

- **Results**: Using an intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate was more efficacious than placebo at increasing the weekly proportion of cocaine nonuse days, irrespective of whether missing data were imputed to the baseline value or not (13.3% vs. 5.3%, 95% CI for the estimated mean difference, 1.4%-14.6%, P = .02 or 8.9% vs. 3.7%, 95% CI).

### Medication compliance and satisfaction with treatment for HIV disease in a sample of African-American crack cocaine smokers [^117G2R7R]. AIDS and Behavior (2004). Low credibility.

The development of treatment regimens for African-American HIV-infected crack cocaine users has often been based on assumptions about compliance with medication regimes rather than evidence. This study sought to obtain baseline information on the adherence to antiretroviral medications by members of this important risk population in Houston, Texas. It was found that for only 5 of a range of 16 antiviral medications, there was a significant correlation between levels of compliance reported by respondents and their beliefs about how effective these medications are. Medication compliance was also found to be unrelated to the frequency of crack cocaine use in the month prior to the interview. Furthermore, irrespective of gender and their reported extent of medication compliance, respondents generally reported positive relationships with their treating physician, with higher levels of satisfaction reported by women.

These results suggest that the majority of African-American crack cocaine users are able to comply with HIV treatment regimens, with more than half (53%) claiming full compliance for one or more medications, and a further one third (31%) claiming compliance more than half the time. Moreover, these findings suggest that they will continue to take antiretroviral medications even if they have doubts about the effectiveness of these medications.

### Cocaine use in adolescents and young adults [^1123J5yX]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). High credibility.

Cocaine use by adolescents and young adults continues to be a significant public health issue and the cause of medical and psychological morbidity and mortality. Although use rates are lower than those seen with alcohol, tobacco, and other illicit substances such as marijuana, cocaine is highly addictive and presents significant acute and long-term medical and psychological effects. This article reviews the epidemiology of cocaine use among adolescents and young adults, discusses the pharmacology and neurobiology of cocaine use and dependence, provides information regarding acute intoxication and systemic effects seen with more chronic use, and describes assessment and treatment approaches.

### Dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence [^115rBTFw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a major drug of abuse, and cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition that has become a substantial public health problem. There is a well-documented range of consequences associated with chronic use of this drug, including medical, psychological, and social problems. These issues encompass the spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, as well as crime, violence, and neonatal drug exposure.

Therapeutic management of cocaine addicts includes an initial period of abstinence from the drug. During this phase, individuals may experience intense craving for cocaine and symptoms such as depression, fatigue, irritability, anorexia, and sleep disturbances. Acute use of cocaine has been shown to enhance dopamine transmission, whereas chronic use decreases dopamine concentrations in the brain. Pharmacological treatment that affects dopamine could theoretically reduce these symptoms and contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2000), LILACS (from 1982 to 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 to 2000), Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Additionally, we conducted reference searching, personal communication, reviewed conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

### Tiagabine increases cocaine-free urines in cocaine-dependent methadone-treated patients: Results of a randomized pilot study [^111fqD8v]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the GABAergic agent tiagabine in reducing cocaine use among methadone-treated patients. The study was a ten-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Opiate Treatment Research Program, Veteran's Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven, Connecticut, USA.

The participants were 45 cocaine-dependent methadone-treated patients who were predominately Caucasian (75.6%), male (77.8%), and never married (53%), with an average age of 38 years (SD = 6.5). Comparison groups received tiagabine 12 mg/day (n = 15), tiagabine 24 mg/day (n = 15), or placebo (n = 15).

Baseline assessments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Addiction Severity Index, a urine drug test, self-reported use, and opiate withdrawal scales. Urine drug tests were performed thrice weekly.

Treatment retention was over 80% for all treatment groups. The sample mean (± SE) of cocaine-free urines for the first week after study entry and before tiagabine was started was 1.16 (0.19) urines/week. During weeks 9 and 10, cocaine-free urines increased significantly from baseline by 33% with high-dose tiagabine (24 mg/day), by 14% with low-dose tiagabine (12 mg/day), and decreased by 10% with placebo (hierarchical linear model, Z = 2.03; P < 0.05). Self-reported cocaine use also decreased significantly more with active medications than with placebo.

Tiagabine at 24 mg/day was well-tolerated among these methadone-treated patients, with only one reporting headache.

### New directions in medication-facilitated behavioral treatment for substance use disorders [^111NdVk6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A promising approach to addressing substance use disorders is to integrate pharmacotherapy with a behavioral treatment with which synergy is possible. In this review, we focus on recent research suggesting that this approach may be effective for cocaine and cannabis use disorders, both of which currently lack efficacious medications. We summarize potential targets of pharmacotherapy of particular relevance to combined medication-behavioral treatment and examine preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy. Common to these promising medications is a hypothesized mechanism of action predicated on reversing drug-related neural adaptations, such as high reactivity to stress or drug cues, that might undermine fruitful engagement with behavioral treatment. We also review emerging medications, such as certain glutamatergic and serotonergic agents, which may be feasibly integrated with existing treatments. We conclude with an outline of future directions for research.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^116Z9o5q]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent clinical trials of modafinil in human subjects have highlighted either its impact upon actual cocaine use or its ability to mitigate symptoms associated with cocaine abstinence. The rationale for using this medication relates to its stimulant-like properties and potential efficacy as a substitution agent that can reduce craving for cocaine. With regard to its effect upon cocaine use, modafinil was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 210) at two doses (200 mg and 400 mg). However, no significant differences were observed between the modafinil and placebo groups in their change in the average weekly percentage of cocaine non-use days. Notably, modafinil at 200 mg demonstrated a significant reduction in craving as a secondary outcome. Interestingly, post-hoc analysis found an increase in cocaine non-use days among those with co-morbid alcohol dependence who were treated with modafinil, suggesting a possible target subgroup among cocaine-addicted persons.

The impact of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users was examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled, inpatient study (N = 20) by Morgan et al. The researchers found that modafinil at 400 mg decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time. Additionally, by the third week of abstinence from cocaine, the modafinil group experienced longer total sleep time and shorter rapid eye movement (REM) latency. Ultimately, modafinil demonstrated a normalizing effect on sleep, which could be particularly important during early phases of abstinence since this normalization effect may support recovery.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence [^116nWjZe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become a substantial public health problem. The past decade has witnessed a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. While administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake, chronic cocaine abuse leads to down-regulation of monoamine systems. Post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving may be linked to this down-regulation. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology, as well as relieve dysphoria and associated craving through general antidepressant action.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966–2000), EMBASE (from 1980–2000), LILACS (from 1982–2000), PsycLIT (from 1974–2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Additional searches included reference searching, personal communication, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

### Topiramate for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction: A multi-center placebo-controlled trial [^114rpZou]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Topiramate has shown efficacy in facilitating abstinence from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient trial tested topiramate for treating methamphetamine addiction.

- **Design**: Participants (n = 140) were randomized to receive topiramate or placebo over a 13-week period. The dosage was escalated from 25 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] to a target maintenance dose of 200 mg/day during weeks 6–12, then tapered off in week 13. Medication was combined with weekly brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment.

- **Setting**: The trial was conducted across eight medical centers in the United States.

- **Participants**: One hundred forty methamphetamine-dependent adults participated in the trial.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. Secondary outcomes included reduction in use compared to baseline, as well as changes in psychosocial variables.

- **Findings**: In the intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate did not increase abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. However, for secondary outcomes, topiramate significantly reduced weekly median urine methamphetamine levels and observer-rated severity of dependence scores. Subjects with negative urine tests before randomization (n = 26) experienced significantly greater abstinence on topiramate versus placebo during study weeks 6–12. Topiramate was found to be safe and well-tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: While topiramate does not appear to promote abstinence in methamphetamine users, it can reduce the amount taken and decrease relapse rates in those who are already abstinent.

### Disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence [^112WW8z3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists; advances in neurobiology could guide future medication development.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of disulfiram for cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL (up to January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL-The Cochrane Library, 1, 2009), reference lists of trials, main electronic sources of ongoing trials, and conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing disulfiram alone, or associated with psychosocial intervention, with no intervention, placebo, or other pharmacological interventions for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Seven studies involving 492 participants met the inclusion criteria. For disulfiram versus placebo, there were no statistically significant results for dropouts, but there was a trend favoring disulfiram in two studies with 87 participants (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03). One additional study with 107 participants, which favored disulfiram, was excluded from the meta-analysis due to high heterogeneity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.58). Regarding cocaine use, it was not possible to pool primary studies together; however, results from single studies showed that one out of four comparisons favored disulfiram (number of weeks abstinence, 20 participants, WMD 4.50, 95% CI 2.93 to 6.07). For the comparison of disulfiram versus naltrexone, no statistically significant results were found.

### Antipsychotic medications for cocaine dependence [^116Xc1D2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a public health problem characterized by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Cocaine dependence remains a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists, although considerable advances in the neurobiology of this addiction could guide future medication development.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and the acceptability of antipsychotic medications for cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following sources: MEDLINE (1966 to October 2006), EMBASE (1980 to October 2006), CINAHL (1982 to October 2006), and the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Specialized Register (October 2006). We also searched the reference lists of trials, the main electronic sources of ongoing trials (National Research Register, meta-Register of Controlled Trials; Clinical Trials.gov), and conference proceedings likely to contain trials relevant to the review. All searches included non-English language literature.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials with a focus on the use of any antipsychotic medication for cocaine dependence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently evaluated the papers, extracted data, and rated methodological quality.

- **Main results**: Seven small studies were included (293 participants). The antipsychotic drugs studied were risperidone, olanzapine, and haloperidol. No significant differences were found for any of the efficacy measures comparing any antipsychotic with placebo. Risperidone was found to be superior to placebo in diminishing cocaine use.

Cocaine, which first made its appearance over 1,000 years ago, is now widely used throughout the world. The physiologic responses to cocaine may cause severe pathologic effects. This review highlights the many critical care challenges resulting from these effects.

- **Design**: Historical vignettes, epidemiologic factors, modes of preparation and delivery, and the physiologic and pharmacologic effects of these agents are presented.

- **Setting**: Cocaine causes intense vasoconstriction, which potentially causes damage to all organ systems. Examples of these toxicities are presented.

- **Patients**: The adverse multisystem responses to cocaine exposure produce organ failure, which challenges diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic intervention. Organ system failure involves the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, musculature, and other organs. These harmful effects are additive to preexisting organ dysfunction.

- **Intervention**: Recognition of associated cocaine injury alerts the physician that organ dysfunction is more likely to occur and to be more severe. Such anticipation helps plan for therapy in the critical care setting.

- **Results and conclusions**: Cocaine use is an expanding health hazard, despite intense governmental efforts to contain its distribution and use. Recognition of the signs and symptoms of cocaine toxicity helps anticipate the subsequent organ dysfunction and implement earlier organ system support.

### Pharmacotherapeutic strategies for treating cocaine use disorder-what do we have to offer [^117KeZXf]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

Cocaine use continues to be a significant public health problem worldwide. However, despite substantial research efforts, no pharmacotherapies are approved for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD).

- **Argument**: Studies have identified positive signals for a range of medications for treating CUD. These include long-acting amphetamine formulations, modafinil, topiramate, doxazosin, and combined topiramate and mixed amphetamine salts extended-release (MAS-ER). However, valid conclusions about a medication's clinical efficacy require nuanced approaches that take into account behavioral phenotypes of the target population (e.g. frequency of use, co-abuse of cocaine and other substances, genetic subgroups, psychiatric comorbidity), variables related to the medication (e.g. dose, short-/long-acting formulations, titration speed, medication adherence), and other factors that may affect treatment outcomes. Meta-analyses frequently do not account for these co-varying factors, contributing to a somewhat nihilistic view on pharmacotherapeutic options for CUD. In addition, the predominant focus on abstinence, which is difficult for most patients to achieve, may overshadow more nuanced therapeutic signals.

- **Conclusion**: While there is an emphasis on finding new medications with novel mechanisms of action for treating CUD, currently available medications deserve further investigation based on the existing literature. Evaluating refined metrics of treatment success in well-defined subgroups of patients and further exploring combination therapies and their synergy with behavioral interventions could provide more comprehensive treatment strategies.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^115wpT1p]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) provides guidelines for the use of medications in treating addiction involving opioid use. These guidelines are detailed in the full text, with key references and disclosures available in Supplemental Digital Content 1.

- **Guideline group members**: The guideline committee includes distinguished members such as Sandra Comer, PhD; Chinazo Cunningham, MD, MS; and Marc J. Fishman, MD, FASAM, among others. The ASAM Quality Improvement Council, chaired by Margaret Jarvis, MD, FASAM, also contributes significantly to these guidelines. Special mention is given to external reviewer Michael M. Miller, MD, FASAM, FAPA.

- **Treatment Research Institute technical team members**: Key contributors include Amanda Abraham, PhD; Karen Dugosh, PhD; David Festinger, PhD; and Kyle Kampman, MD, Principal Investigator.

These guidelines are integral in standardizing the medical treatment of opioid addiction and are continually refined by contributions from various experts in the field.

### Vaccines against drug abuse [^115QoiK8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The currently available medications for the treatment of drug abuse have achieved only limited success. Anti-addiction vaccines, designed to elicit antibodies that block the pharmacological effects of drugs, demonstrate significant potential for treating drug abuse. We review the status of two vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials, specifically for cocaine and nicotine addiction, and two additional vaccines in preclinical development, targeting methamphetamine and heroin addiction. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and ethical concerns associated with the development and future therapeutic use of anti-addiction vaccines.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^113XLEJs]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor and a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Because the DBH enzyme converts dopamine to norepinephrine, its inhibition leads to a decrease in neuronal and synaptic norepinephrine levels relative to dopamine. This neurobiochemical mechanism has been proposed as a potential therapy for cocaine dependence, extensively studied in human clinical trials, and found to result in modulation of the reinforcing properties of cocaine and reduction of cocaine use. Most recently, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) of disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence in methadone-stabilized individuals showed that, in the group receiving 250 mg/day, there was a significant decrease in cocaine-positive urines over time compared to lower doses of the medication or placebo. Interestingly, lower dosages of the medication (62.5 mg and 125 mg, respectively) were associated with increased self-report of cocaine use as well as cocaine-positive urines. Future study of disulfiram should focus on dosing strategy as well as the identification of subpopulations in which the drug is maximally effective.

Nepicastat, a selective DBH-inhibitor that has yet to come to market, is currently under investigation for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In preclinical trials, nepicastat has demonstrated an ability to (1) increase synaptic levels of dopamine, (2) decrease brain norepinephrine levels, and (3) block cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rats.

### Pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116vP7Gw]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, there are no accepted FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for cocaine use disorder, although numerous medications have been tested in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple data sources, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library, through November 2017 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions in adults with cocaine use disorder. When possible, we combined the findings of trials with comparable interventions and outcome measures in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias of individual trials and the strength of evidence for each outcome using standardized criteria. Outcomes included continuous abstinence (3+ consecutive weeks), cocaine use, harms, and study retention. For relapse prevention studies (participants abstinent at baseline), we examined lapse (first cocaine positive or missing UDS) and relapse (two consecutive cocaine positive or missed UDS).

- **Results**: Sixty-six different drugs or drug combinations were studied in seven systematic reviews and 48 RCTs that met inclusion criteria. Antidepressants were the most widely studied drug class (38 RCTs) but appear to have no effect on cocaine use or treatment retention. Increased abstinence was found with bupropion (2 RCTs: RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.59), topiramate (2 RCTs: RR 2.56, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.73), and psychostimulants (14 RCTs: RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.77), though the strength of evidence remains uncertain.

### Cognitive enhancement as a pharmacotherapy target for stimulant addiction [^113Kxn8M]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

No medications have been proven to be effective for cocaine and methamphetamine addiction. Attenuation of drug reward has been the main strategy for medication development, but this approach has not led to effective treatments. Thus, there is a need to identify novel treatment targets in addition to the brain reward system.

- **Aim**: To propose a novel treatment strategy for stimulant addiction that will focus on medications enhancing cognitive function and attenuating drug reward.

- **Methods**: Pre-clinical and clinical literature on the potential use of cognitive enhancers for stimulant addiction pharmacotherapy was reviewed.

- **Results and conclusions**: Cocaine and methamphetamine users show significant cognitive impairments, especially in attention, working memory, and response inhibition functions. These cognitive impairments seem to predict poor treatment retention and outcome. Medications targeting acetylcholine and norepinephrine are particularly well suited for enhancing cognitive function in stimulant users. Many cholinergic and noradrenergic medications are on the market and have a good safety profile and low abuse potential. These include galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine (cholinesterase inhibitors); varenicline (partial nicotine agonist); guanfacine (alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist); and atomoxetine (norepinephrine transporter inhibitor). Future clinical studies designed optimally to measure cognitive function as well as drug use behavior would be needed to test the efficacy of these cognitive enhancers for stimulant addiction.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^112Cqq3h]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

It would be of value to focus on the combination of substance use and polydrug use, as cocaine as an adjunctive substance is frequently recorded in combination with primary use of opioids [1]. In the United Kingdom, there has been a recent increase in clients starting treatment for opiate and crack problem use [27]. In Belgium, between 2015 and 2018, clients entering treatment for opiates, cannabis, and alcohol as primary substances reported increased consumption of cocaine as an adjunctive substance [28].

- **Study limitations**: The study is subject to a range of limitations. First, TDI data provided information on clients entering drug treatment (for the first time in their life or after previous treatment) during the reporting year; this means that data on clients who are in continuous treatment (i.e. who remain in treatment from one year to the next) were not provided. Secondly, treatment data collected by the national TDI systems did not cover all treatment demand and hence need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, coverage of treatment services was not 100%, and the proportion differed by country. Inclusion of treatment services not currently represented may provide different results. However, data coverage of specialized outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities is good in most countries, with lower representation concentrated among other services (e.g. general practitioners, low-threshold agencies, prisons) [15]. Thirdly, not all years were available for all countries, which might also have influenced some figures.

### Dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence [^11316pLX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition that has become a substantial public health problem. There is a wide and well-documented range of consequences associated with chronic use of this drug, including medical, psychological, and social problems such as the spread of infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis), crime, violence, and neonatal drug exposure. Therapeutic management of cocaine addicts includes an initial period of abstinence from the drug. During this phase, subjects may experience intense cravings for cocaine, in addition to symptoms such as depression, fatigue, irritability, anorexia, and sleep disturbances. It has been demonstrated that the acute use of cocaine may enhance dopamine transmission and, chronically, it decreases dopamine concentrations in the brain. Pharmacological treatment that affects dopamine could theoretically reduce these symptoms and contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, Biological Abstracts, and LILACS; reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry; book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence were performed for the primary version of this review in 2001. Another search of the electronic databases was done in December 2002 for this update.

### Novel pharmacotherapeutic treatments for cocaine addiction [^112mLDEQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a stimulant that leads to the rapid accumulation of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain by preventing their re-uptake into the neuron that released the neurotransmitter. Cocaine use disorders are widely accepted as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Cocaine use is associated with numerous acute and chronic medical complications, ranging from coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, and respiratory disease to neurologic and psychiatric consequences such as cerebral hemorrhage, mood disorders, and psychosis. Additionally, cocaine use has been associated with increased risk of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and violence.

Development of effective treatments for cocaine dependence is necessary to reduce the impact of this illness upon both the individual and society. These treatments need to reduce cocaine use and have excellent compliance, which has encouraged depot and other long-lasting formulations. Currently, however, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the treatment of this illness, and behavioral therapies alone have demonstrated limited efficacy. Our growing understanding of cocaine neurobiology has translated into numerous studies of pharmacologic agents for the treatment of cocaine dependence in both animal and human models. These models include human laboratory drug administration studies using surrogate endpoints such as craving, subjective effects, and behavioral choices of money versus drug. This article reviews findings from recent cocaine pharmacotherapy studies.

### Topiramate for cocaine dependence: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115i5Q4Q]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of topiramate in treating cocaine use disorder, focusing on retention, efficacy, safety, and craving reduction, through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Six scientific databases were searched from their inception to December 23, 2014, with no date restrictions. Data were systematically reviewed, extracted, and analyzed. Studies included were peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials with participants meeting diagnostic criteria for cocaine dependence or cocaine use disorder. The treatment arm involved topiramate with or without psychosocial intervention, while the control arm involved no intervention or psychosocial intervention, with or without placebo. A random-effects meta-analytical model was computed.

- **Results**: Five studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 518). Topiramate was compared with placebo in four studies and with no medication in one study. The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between topiramate and placebo in improving treatment retention (risk ratio (RR) = 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60–1.22, P = 0.38). However, compared with a placebo, topiramate use was associated with increased continuous abstinence in two of five studies (RR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.31–4.53, P = 0.005). No differences were observed in the frequency of adverse effects reported between topiramate and placebo (RR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.91–1.23, P = 0.48). Topiramate significantly reduced craving (P < 0.05) in only one of five studies.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence does not currently support the use of topiramate to improve treatment for cocaine use disorder.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with opioid use disorder, the BAP 2012 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support adding bupropion, desipramine, amantadine, or gabapentin to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment to reduce cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine users.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence and problematic cocaine use [^116YTwpX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment of proven efficacy exists; advances in neurobiology could guide future medication development.

- **Objective**: To investigate the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants alone or in combination with any psychosocial intervention for the treatment of cocaine dependence and problematic cocaine use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL in July 2011, and reached out to researchers for unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing antidepressants alone or associated with psychosocial intervention versus placebo, no treatment, other pharmacological, or psychosocial interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: 37 studies were included in the review (3,551 participants). Antidepressants versus placebo: results for dropouts did not show evidence of difference (31 studies, 2,819 participants, RR 1.03 [CI 95% 0.93 to 1.14]). Looking at abstinence from cocaine use, even though not statistically significant, the difference shown by the analysis in the three-week abstinence rate was in favor of antidepressants (eight studies, 942 participants, RR 1.22 [CI 95% 0.99 to 1.51]). Considering only studies involving tricyclics (five studies, 367 participants), or only desipramine (four studies, 254 participants), the evidence was in favor of antidepressants.

### Clinical effects beyond cocaine use of sustained-release dexamphetamine for the treatment of cocaine dependent patients with comorbid opioid dependence: secondary analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^116Cn93x]. Addiction (2020). High credibility.

Sustained-release (SR) formulations of dexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts have shown positive effects in the treatment of patients with a cocaine use disorder. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of SR-dexamphetamine for patients with cocaine dependence in terms of cocaine use reductions. In this secondary analysis, we assessed whether SR-dexamphetamine treatment also improves the health status of these patients.

- **Design**: Multi-centre randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Four supervised heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) out-patient clinics in the Netherlands. In HAT, methadone treatment-refractory opioid-dependent patients can self-administer individually titrated doses of pharmaceutical grade diacetylmorphine, coprescribed with oral methadone.

- **Participants**: Seventy-three cocaine-dependent patients (90% males; average age = 48.7 years), participating in HAT for their treatment-refractory comorbid opioid dependence.

- **Interventions**: Twelve weeks pharmacotherapy with once-daily, supervised intake of two tablets of SR-dexamphetamine (2 × 30 mg/day) or two identical placebo tablets.

- **Measurements**: Assessment every 4 weeks included cocaine use (time-line follow-back), physical health (Maudsley Addiction Profile-Health Symptoms Scale), mental health (Brief Symptom Inventory), and illegal activities (Addiction Severity Index). The primary outcome was 'overall health', a dichotomous, multi-domain response index based on physical health, mental health, and social functioning.

Findings compared with placebo, SR-dexamphetamine resulted in lar…

### Cocaine hydrochloride [^116o3Bzx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution is approved for topical single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, so physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop. Although Goprelto is not indicated for chronic therapy, repeated misuse or abuse of this product may lead to physical dependence.

### Antidepressants for cocaine dependence [^111WeHfV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become a substantial public health problem. Over the past decade, there has been a sustained search for an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The administration of cocaine acutely increases intercellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels by blocking their presynaptic reuptake. However, chronic cocaine abuse leads to the down-regulation of monoamine systems, which may result in post-cocaine use depression and cocaine craving. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy, by augmenting monoamine levels, may alleviate cocaine abstinence symptomatology and relieve dysphoria and associated craving through general antidepressant action.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of all RCTs on the use of antidepressants for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2000), LILACS (from 1982 to 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 to 2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). Additional searches included reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry; and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized controlled trials were that they should focus on the use of antidepressants in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as opiate dependence were also eligible.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^1135eA9w]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The trends were broken down by the type of cocaine reported (powder cocaine or crack), the client's history in addiction treatment (previously treated or not), and the primary role of cocaine in the treatment demand. Studying the difference for these two types of cocaine is important, because these substances tend to be used by different user populations [16] and are associated with different clinical profiles and intensity of harms [17].

### A single ketamine infusion combined with mindfulness-based behavioral modification to treat cocaine dependence: A randomized clinical trial [^116QnpEG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Research has suggested that subanesthetic doses of ketamine may work to improve cocaine-related vulnerabilities and facilitate efforts at behavioral modification. The purpose of this trial was to test whether a single ketamine infusion improved treatment outcomes in cocaine-dependent adults engaged in mindfulness-based relapse prevention.

- **Methods**: Fifty-five cocaine-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (the control condition) during a 5-day inpatient stay, during which they also initiated a 5-week course of mindfulness-based relapse prevention. Cocaine use was assessed through self-report and urine toxicology. The primary outcomes were end-of-study abstinence and time to relapse (defined as first use or dropout).

- **Results**: Overall, 48.2% of individuals in the ketamine group maintained abstinence over the last 2 weeks of the trial, compared with 10.7% in the midazolam group (intent-to-treat analysis). The ketamine group was 53% less likely (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.24, 0.92) to relapse (dropout or use cocaine) compared with the midazolam group, and craving scores were 58.1% lower in the ketamine group throughout the trial (95% CI = 18.6, 78.6); both differences were statistically significant. Infusions were well tolerated, and no participants were removed from the study as a result of adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: A single ketamine infusion improved a range of important treatment outcomes in cocaine-dependent adults engaged in mindfulness-based behavioral modification.
