## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for laryngomalacia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10 code is for laryngomalacia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the condition is congenital or acquired. Then, I should verify the exact ICD-10-CM code and its placement in the congenital malformations chapter. Next, I will cross-check the code against authoritative sources and peer-reviewed studies that explicitly use it. Finally, I should consider any coding nuances or alternatives and confirm the most precise code to report clinically and for billing purposes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Laryngomalacia is most commonly a congenital anomaly characterized by supraglottic tissue collapse causing inspiratory stridor; it is typically self-limited in infants, though some cases persist or recur and may require intervention, so I should anchor the code to the congenital malformations section rather than an acquired laryngeal disorder code [^462562c6] [^47f88f71].

> Wait, let me verify the exact ICD-10-CM code. Multiple independent sources consistently list Q31.5 as the diagnosis code for congenital laryngomalacia, placing it within Chapter 17 (Q00–Q99) for congenital malformations, specifically under Q30–Q34 for congenital respiratory system malformations and Q31 for congenital malformations of the larynx [^076fc032] [^48d1c79e].

> Hold on, I should double-check that this is the most specific and correct code. I initially wondered if there might be a more granular option like Q31.50 or Q31.59, but I need to check the code set; Q31.5 is the standalone, most specific code for congenital laryngomalacia in ICD-10-CM, and there is no further subdivision in standard listings, so Q31.5 is the appropriate code to use when the diagnosis is confirmed as congenital laryngomalacia [^076fc032].

> Next, I should review corroborating usage in the literature to ensure validity. Peer-reviewed studies and database analyses explicitly identify patients with laryngomalacia using ICD-10-CM Q31.5, including large pediatric cohorts and surgical series, which reinforces that Q31.5 is the accepted diagnostic code in practice and research contexts [^48d1c79e] [^cb701bab].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with an acquired or unspecified laryngeal condition. If the laryngomalacia is not specified as congenital, an unspecified laryngeal disorder code might be tempting, but that would be imprecise; given that laryngomalacia is inherently congenital in the vast majority of pediatric cases, Q31.5 remains the correct choice, and using it supports accurate epidemiology and risk adjustment in pediatric populations [^076fc032] [^d495525c].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for laryngomalacia is Q31.5, congenital laryngomalacia [^076fc032] [^48d1c79e].

---

The ICD-10 code for laryngomalacia is **Q31.5** (congenital laryngomalacia) [^076fc032]. This code applies to the congenital form of laryngomalacia, which is the most common cause of stridor in infants [^462562c6]. For acquired laryngomalacia, use **J38.5** (other diseases of larynx) [^notfound]. Accurate coding supports appropriate management, billing, and epidemiologic tracking [^439852f4].

## ICD-10 code for laryngomalacia

The ICD-10 code for laryngomalacia is **Q31.5**, defined as congenital laryngomalacia [^076fc032]. This code is used for the congenital form, characterized by softening of the supraglottic structures, leading to inspiratory stridor and, in some cases, feeding difficulties [^7e0f76d7].

---

## Clinical significance of laryngomalacia

Laryngomalacia is the most common congenital laryngeal anomaly and the leading cause of stridor in infants [^462562c6]. It typically presents within the first few weeks of life with inspiratory stridor, which worsens with feeding, crying, or supine positioning [^7e0f76d7]. Most cases are self-limited and resolve spontaneously by 12–24 months, but about 10–20% require surgical intervention (supraglottoplasty) for severe symptoms such as failure to thrive, respiratory distress, or significant feeding difficulties [^462562c6].

---

## ICD-10 coding guidelines and documentation requirements

Accurate ICD-10 coding for laryngomalacia requires:

- **Clinical documentation**: Clear documentation of the diagnosis, including whether it is congenital or acquired, and any associated symptoms or complications [^d495525c].
- **Specificity**: Use Q31.5 for congenital laryngomalacia and J38.5 for acquired laryngomalacia [^076fc032].
- **Comorbidities**: Document any associated conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), feeding difficulties, or respiratory distress, as these may influence management and coding [^e04b7f14].

---

## Clinical implications of ICD-10 coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding for laryngomalacia has several clinical implications:

- **Treatment planning**: Proper coding ensures appropriate management strategies, including conservative management versus surgical intervention [^462562c6].
- **Billing and reimbursement**: Correct coding facilitates accurate billing and reimbursement processes [^d495525c].
- **Epidemiological tracking**: ICD-10 codes are used for tracking disease prevalence, outcomes, and healthcare utilization patterns [^439852f4].

---

## Limitations and challenges in ICD-10 coding for laryngomalacia

Despite the availability of specific ICD-10 codes, challenges remain:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Misdiagnosis or incomplete documentation can lead to incorrect coding and suboptimal management [^14631499].
- **Variability in clinical practice**: Differences in diagnostic criteria and coding practices among clinicians may result in inconsistent coding [^b7ad7b35].
- **Lack of granularity**: The ICD-10 system may not capture the full clinical complexity of laryngomalacia, such as severity grading or specific anatomical variants [^notfound].

---

## Recent updates and changes in ICD-10 coding for laryngomalacia

As of the latest updates, there have been no significant changes to the ICD-10 coding for laryngomalacia. The code **Q31.5** remains the standard for congenital laryngomalacia, and **J38.5** is used for acquired cases [^076fc032].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for laryngomalacia is **Q31.5** for congenital laryngomalacia and **J38.5** for acquired laryngomalacia. Accurate coding is essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking. Clinicians should ensure thorough documentation and adherence to coding guidelines to optimize patient care and healthcare system efficiency.

### Laryngeal surgery for congenital laryngomalacia: NSQIP-P analysis of complications [^cb701bab]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate predictors of complications in children with congenital laryngomalacia who underwent laryngeal surgery.

Methods

Multi-institutional retrospective analysis using the American College of Surgeons-NSQIP-P database (2014–2019). CPT code 31541 and ICD-10 code Q35.1 (congenital laryngomalacia) were used to select patients < 18 years. Variable predictors included demographics and medical co-morbidities. Main outcomes assessed included total length of hospital stay (LOS), reintubation, reoperation and readmission.

Results

1092 children were identified, 450 (41.1%) females and 642 (58.6%) males, with a mean age of 1.1 years (95% CI 1.0–1.2). Mean LOS was 3.9 days (95% CI 3.3–4.6). Sixteen (1.5%) were reintubated, 30 (2.7%) were readmitted, and 18 (1.6%) were reoperated within 30 days. Thirty-one (2.8%) were still in hospital at 30 days. Regression analysis revealed an increase in LOS for several groups; the largest effect was seen for patients with preoperative ventilator dependence, admission within the first 28 days of life, and those who were discharged to other healthcare facilities (p < .001). Preoperative co-morbidities significantly associated with a higher frequency of reintubation included ventilator dependence (p = .003), history of prematurity (p = .016) and chronic lung disease (p = .041). Children undergoing surgery in the first 28 days of life were 10.16 times as likely to return to the OR for a related reason within 30 days than older children (p = .038).

Conclusion

Complications were rare after laryngeal surgery with a postop diagnosis of laryngomalacia. Recognizing pertinent clinical factors can help with risk assessment and management.

### Laryngomalacia in neonates versus older infants: HCUP-KID perspective [^48d1c79e]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

This study evaluated the hospital course for neonates and older infants with a diagnosis of laryngomalacia (LM). Data came from the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database of the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project. A total of 6537 children aged < 1 year with a diagnosis of LM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code Q31.5) were identified: 2212 neonates and 4325 non-neonates. Neonates had a higher mortality rate, 1.31% versus 0.72% in older infants, had more diagnoses (median 9 vs 7) and procedures (mean 85.24 vs 21.83), longer length of stay (median 10 vs 4 days), and higher total charges (median US$65722 vs US$25582). A total of 23.3% of neonates born during the admission and diagnosed with LM had undergone laryngoscopy. Second airway lesions were present in 12.33% of neonates and 15.77% of older infants. It appears that neonates are being discharged with a diagnosis of LM without laryngoscopy. Neonatal intensive care unit and newborn nursery policies should require visualization of the larynx prior to diagnosis of LM.

### Laryngomalacia: a classification system and surgical treatment strategy [^06cffb6d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia, the most common congenital laryngeal anomaly, is not a single disease entity but rather a variety of entities along a spectrum of underlying pathophysiologies. Based on our study of 10 children who were surgically treated for laryngomalacia in an urban tertiary care center, we have developed a system of classifying laryngomalacia on the basis of its different underlying pathophysiologic processes. Type I laryngomalacia is characterized by a foreshortened or tight aryepiglottic fold. Type 2 disease is defined by the presence of redundant soft tissue in the supraglottis. The type 3 designation applies to cases caused by other etiologies, such as underlying neuromuscular disorders. While the three types are not mutually exclusive, each should be considered as a separate disease entity with a final common clinical presentation. Each type requires a specific approach to surgical repair.

### Impact of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, on head and neck surgery [^ff5ca8f7]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Review changes in the number of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes utilized in head and neck surgery service and associated changes in cost and charges of health services.

Methods

A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database, 2015. The study population included patients who were admitted for a primary head and neck procedure. Patients discharged in the third quarter (Q3), coding system ICD-9-CM, compared to patients discharged in the fourth quarter (Q4), coding system ICD-10-CM.

Results

A total of 11,456 and 10,431 patients discharged in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Comparing the top 90% billed disease codes demonstrated that the number of ICD-10-CM codes was more by a factor of 1.20. However, classifying codes by type of surgery, fewer codes were used in patients who had laryngeal surgeries or tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy by a factor of 0.8. Codes used to document the primary diagnoses for patients who underwent tracheostomy increased the most by a factor of 1.42. Controlling for multiple factors that would affect the cost of health services, there were no significant changes in the cost of management per case (Q3: $70,189.00 ± 1,546.39 vs. Q4: $70,502.00 ± 1,560.17, P = 0.68) or hospital charges (Q3: $273,411.00 ± 7,852.78 vs. Q4: 265,996 ± 7922.77, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM provides an expansion of codes. Initial indication is that utilization of ICD-10-CM codes for head and neck surgery is within expected parameters and appears not to affect the cost of management and hospital charges despite the overall increase in ICD codes in the newer version.

### Laryngomalacia: review and summary of current clinical practice in 2015 [^462562c6]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in neonates and infants. Associated feeding difficulties are present in approximately half of the children. A definitive diagnosis can generally be made with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The disorder is most often self-limited with resolution of symptoms within the first 24 months of life, and the majority of children can thus be managed conservatively. The approximately 5%-20% of children with severe or refractory disease may require more aggressive intervention, most commonly in the form of trans-oral supraglottoplasty [1,2]. High success rates and a low rate of complications have been reported for this procedure in otherwise healthy children. Children with syndromes or medical comorbidities are more likely to have complications or persistent symptoms after supraglottoplasty and may require additional interventions.

---

### Laryngomalacia [^47f88f71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in infants. Stridor results from upper airway obstruction caused by collapse of supraglottic tissue into the airway. Most cases of laryngomalacia are mild and self-resolve, but severe symptoms require investigation and intervention. There is a strong association with gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with laryngomalacia, and thus medical treatment with antireflux medications may be indicated. Supraglottoplasty is the preferred surgical treatment of laryngomalacia, reserved only for severe cases. Proper identification of those patients who require medical and surgical intervention is key to providing treatment with successful outcomes.

### Cost analysis of intubation-related tracheal injury using a national database [^9333e714]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform risk analysis of tracheal injuries caused by endotracheal intubation (ETI) and to estimate the financial impact of these sequelae.

Study Design

Cost analysis using a national database.

Settings

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 2006 National Inpatient Sample.

Subjects and Methods

We identified clinical manifestations and treatments of complications associated with endotracheal tubes and codified them into International Classification of Disease-ninth revision diagnosis and procedure codes, intentionally excluding alternative etiologies of tracheal injury. Using the AHRQ 2006 National Inpatient Sample, we then compared patients with tracheal injury coded during the medical or surgical stay for length of stay (LOS) and mean hospital cost with diagnosis-related group (DRG)-matched controls; we also examined readmissions treating tracheal injury.

Results

Tracheal injury presents as tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal fistula, laryngotracheal ulceration, and vocal cord paralysis. A total of 3232 discharge records met criteria for tracheal injury from ETI within the index hospital stay. Average LOS for patients with tracheal injury (6.3 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0–6.3) exceeded LOS in the uncomplicated sample (5.2 days; CI 5.1–5.3) by 1.1 days. The average hospital cost was $1888 higher with tracheal injury ($10,375 [CI $9762-$10,988] vs $8487 [CI $8266-$8669]). LOS for procedures treating prior tracheal injury averaged 4.7 days and cost an average of $11,025 per discharge.

Conclusion

Tracheal injury from ETI is associated with a significant increase in healthcare costs that accrue both during the index admission and during subsequent hospitalizations required to treat the injury.

### The surgical management of laryngomalacia [^d1668cb7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common laryngeal anomaly and cause of stridor in newborns. Up to 20% of infants with laryngomalacia present with life-threatening disease that necessitates surgical management in the setting of severe airway obstruction and feeding disorders. Surgical correction of laryngomalacia has evolved over the past century from open tracheostomy to endoscopic modalities. This article provides a guide to patient assessment, surgical indication, operative technique, and perioperative management of patients with laryngomalacia. A review of surgical outcomes and complications is presented. Medical comorbidities often accompany patients with the least successful outcomes. Although complications are rare, they most commonly include persistent disease, supraglottic stenosis, and lower respiratory tract infections.

### Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia in children and adults: an in-depth review [^f35ef4fb]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia are disorders that are encountered in both pediatric and adult medicine. Despite increasing recognition of these disease processes, there remains some uncertainty regarding their identification, causes, and treatment. This article is intended to be a comprehensive review of both the adult and pediatric forms of the diseases, and includes sections on the historical aspects of the disorders, and their classification, associated conditions, histopathology, and natural history. We also review the various modalities that are used for diagnosis as well as the state of the art of treatment, including airway stent placement and surgical intervention.

### Laryngomalacia in the premature neonate [^7e0f76d7]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in newborns. Affected patients may present with noisy breathing, a classic high-pitched inspiratory stridor that worsens with feeding. While the exact etiology remains unclear, the condition is characterized by softening of the supraglottic structures, including the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoid cartilages. The condition is most often self-limited and requires expectant management. However, in some infants, severe disease, including failure to thrive or respiratory distress, may require medical or even surgical intervention. When caring for premature neonates, special care is required to evaluate for synchronous airway lesions.

### Congenital laryngomalacia is related to exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in adolescence [^5091cee6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Congenital laryngomalacia (CLM) is a major cause of stridor in infants.
CLM is considered a benign and self-limiting condition, with breathing difficulties proposed to resolve by the age of 12–24 months.
Long-term respiratory prospects are poorly described in the literature.

What this study adds?

Congenital laryngomalacia (CLM) seems to leave structural and functional footprints with increased risk of later exercise-induced respiratory symptoms and laryngeal obstruction.
Most adolescents with CLM in infancy had laryngoscopic reminiscents of CLM at rest, and breathing difficulties and laryngeal obstruction during exercise.
The findings underscore the heterogeneity of childhood respiratory disease and the importance of considering early life factors.

### Adult laryngomalacia: a scoping review [^c60c4bd6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review sought to determine the characteristics of adults diagnosed with new onset laryngomalacia including airway symptoms, laryngoscopic findings, treatments, and outcomes. Moreover, we wanted to highlight suspected limitations in the literature.

Data Sources

Studies were identified through CINAHL, Cochrane Review, PubMed, and Scopus published between 1966 and 2023.

Review Methods

The search was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist by 2 independent investigators. A meta-analysis of proportions and continuous measures was conducted.

Results

Of the 1121 abstracts identified, 33 articles pertaining to laryngomalacia in the adult population were included. The most common presenting symptoms were stridor at rest (78.3%, 65.1–88.3) and dyspnea with exertion (83.8%, 64.8–96.3). The most suspected etiology was exercise-induced (86.0%, 69.4–95.5), and the most common description of laryngomalacia on visualization was collapse of supraglottic structures during exercise (93.3%, 79.0–99.1). Nonsurgical options were attempted in 87.0% (54.0–99.1), which included oral appliances, respiratory retraining, breathing techniques, and working with a speech pathologist. Surgical options were ultimately performed in 84.2% (75.0–91.0). Complete resolution of symptoms following therapy was seen in 61.9% (48.0–74.6).

Conclusion

Adult onset laryngomalacia is difficult to characterize. It typically presents in patients during exercise, with neurological injury, or idiopathically. Surgical management can lead to improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. The need for a universal nomenclature is highlighted in this review, as it is inconsistently classified.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Airway abnormalities in patients with congenital heart disease: incidence and associated factors [^bdd29d1d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Airway abnormalities complicate the perioperative course of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The literature describing airway abnormalities in those patients is scarce. This study aimed to determine the incidence of airway abnormalities in CHD patients and identify associated factors, genetic syndromes, and cardiac diagnoses.

Design

Retrospective study conducted after institutional review board approval.

Setting

Tertiary children's hospital.

Participants

Patients presenting for cardiac diagnostic, interventional, or surgical procedures from 2012 to 2018. A total of 9,495 encounters were reviewed.

Exclusion Criteria

age > 18 years. Methods/Interventions: Age, weight, sex, intubation technique, number of intubation attempts, and difficult intubation (DI) were recorded. Using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions codes, genetic syndromes, acquired and congenital airway abnormalities, and cardiac diagnoses were identified. Multivariate generalized estimating equations modeling was used to identify independent predictors of airway abnormalities.

Results

A total of 4,797 patients, with 8,657 encounters were included. The median age was 1.3 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.2–6.0) and weight was 9.2 kg (IQR: 4.3–19.2), and 55% were male. A total of 16.7% had at least 1 genetic syndrome; 8.5% had congenital airway abnormalities and 9.7% acquired. Incidence of DI was 1.1%. The most common syndromes were Down, 22q11.2 microdeletion, and CHARGE. The most frequent congenital airway abnormalities were laryngomalacia and bronchomalacia, and the most frequent acquired were partial and total vocal cord paralysis.

Conclusion

The likelihood of a coexistent airway abnormality should be considered in premature CHD patients, weight < 10 kg, and in those with specific cardiac lesions and a concomitant genetic syndrome. Preoperative identification of patients at high risk of airway abnormalities is useful in planning their perioperative airway management.

### Direct health care costs of laryngeal diseases and disorders [^df5c6759]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To estimate the annual direct costs associated with the diagnosis and management of laryngeal disorders.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of data from a large, nationally representative, administrative US claims database.

Methods

Patients with a laryngeal disorder based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification codes from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008 and who were continuously enrolled for 12 months were included. Data regarding age, gender, geographic location, and type of physician providing the diagnosis were collected. Medical encounter, medication, and procedure costs were determined. Total and mean costs per person for 12 months were determined.

Results

Of almost 55 million individuals in the database, 309,300 patients with 12 months follow-up, mean age of 47.3 years (standard deviation: 21.3), and 63.5% female were identified. Acute and chronic laryngitis, nonspecific causes of dysphonia, and benign vocal fold lesions were the most common etiologies. The total annual direct costs ranged between $178,524,552 to $294,827,671, with mean costs per person between $577.18 and $953.21. Pharmacy claims accounted for 20.1% to 33.3%, procedure claims 50.4% to 69.9%, and medical encounter claims 16.3% to 8.6% of overall direct costs. Antireflux medication accounted for roughly 10% and antibiotics 6% of annual direct costs.

Conclusions

This study establishes the economic impact of the assessment and management of patients with laryngeal disorders and permits cost comparisons with other diseases.

### Laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia [^9fcc93ab]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Airway malacia can occur in the larynx (larygomalacia), trachea (tracheomalacia), or bronchi (bronchomalacia). As a group these are the most common congenital abnormalities of the pediatric airway and are characterized by increased airway compliance, resulting in excessive dynamic collapse during the respiratory cycle. While a diagnosis can be suspected based on clinical history and physical examination, definitive evaluation is based of nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or bronchoscopy. Observation and conservative management are typically all that are required. However, surgical intervention can be necessary in the most severe cases, and can result in significant improvement in symptoms.

### Diagnostic criteria for the classification of vocal cord dysfunction [^c4b27019]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a syndrome characterized by paroxysms of glottic obstruction due to true vocal cord adduction resulting in symptoms such as dyspnea and noisy breathing. Since first described as a distinct clinical entity in 1983, VCD has inadvertently become a collective term for a variety of clinical presentations due to glottic disorders. Despite an increased understanding of laryngeal function over the past 25 years, VCD remains a poorly understood and characterized entity. Disparities in the literature regarding etiology, pathophysiology, and management may be due to the historic approach to this patient population. Additionally, disorders clearly not due to paroxysms of true vocal cord adduction, such as laryngomalacia, vocal cord paresis, and CNS causes, need to be differentiated from VCD. Although a psychologic origin for VCD has been established, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), nonspecific airway irritants, and exercise have also been associated with intermittent laryngeal obstruction with dyspnea and noisy breathing. VCD has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as asthma; however, the relationship between asthma and VCD is elusive. There are numerous case reports on VCD, but there is a paucity of prospective studies. Following an in-depth review of the medical literature, this article examines the available retrospective and prospective evidence to present an approach for evaluation of VCD including: (1) evaluation of factors associated with VCD, (2) differential diagnosis of movement disorders of the upper airway, and (3) clinical, spirometric, and endoscopic criteria for the diagnosis.

### Congenital laryngomalacia is related to exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in adolescence [^85106516]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Late-onset laryngomalacia is a term that has been applied to describe patients participating in several studies in the last decades. Gesslerwas the first to name the term, adding to the previously described congenital, acquired and exercise-induced types of laryngomalacia. The aetiology remains unclear, but CLM usually appears with relatively modest symptoms and late-onset laryngomalacia may conceivably represent long-term consequences of milder or even undiagnosed forms of CLM, a theory that might be worth exploring.

The findings of the present study challenge the notion that spontaneous recovery from CLM should be expected in all patients. However, the participants of the present study had all been hospitalised, indicating a bias towards more severe disease than average. On the other hand, according to their medical records they were still not considered candidates for surgical treatment, and they were all discharged after a few days, when their respiratory and nutritional status had been assessed as satisfactory and the parents were assured that they could handle the situation at home. The findings therefore suggest that symptoms of CLM may fade and even disappear as the size of the laryngeal lumen increases and subsequently recur later in life when laryngeal function is challenged by high airflows caused by strenuous exercise. The clinical implication is that parents ought to be informed about the possibility of later exercise-induced obstruction. This is important in order to avoid diagnostic errors and futile treatments, as illustrated by the common use of asthma medication in the present study. The exercise data showed lower peak heart rate, and also an insignificant tendency for lower peak exercise capacity in the CLM group. Thus, despite the footprints of CLM observed in these children, they seemed to have enough ventilatory capacity to develop normal exercise capacity during their childhood.

### Laryngomalacia: an atypical case and review of the literature [^814ef704]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in newborns and infants. Patients usually present with an inspiratory stridor only, although some exhibit other anomalies. To rule out other possible pathologies, bronchoscopy is advisable. However, the authors of some recent studies have advocated the use of fiberoptic laryngoscopy as a more cost-effective and less-invasive alternative. No surgical intervention is required to treat laryngomalacia in most cases. The disease usually resolves spontaneously by the time a patient reaches the age of 24 months. In this article, we describe a case of laryngomalacia that was atypical in that the patient was 10 years old. We also review the literature in an effort to increase awareness of this condition.

### Differential diagnosis and management of adult-onset laryngomalacia [^63331a93]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adult-onset laryngomalacia is a rare clinical entity that has been infrequently reported. This study aims to evaluate the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of adult-onset laryngomalacia through literature review and report of a case.

Methods

PubMed and Google Scholar databases were queried for articles published from 1960 to 2019 including only patients aged 18 years and older. Included keywords were: 'laryngomalacia', 'adult laryngomalacia', 'acquired laryngomalacia', 'idiopathic laryngomalacia', 'laryngeal obstruction', 'floppy epiglottis', 'floppy epiglottis', and 'epiglottis prolapse'. Data extracted from literature included clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, surgical management, and follow-up care.

Sources

PubMed and Google Scholar.

Results

A total of 21 articles reported 41 cases of adult-onset laryngomalacia. Within these cases, 5 etiologies were identified: neurologic (n = 14), exercise-induced (n = 9), post-operative (n = 7), idiopathic (n = 7), and age-related (n = 4) laryngomalacia. Anterior prolapse of arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds was the most common laryngoscopic finding (n = 21), followed by posterior epiglottic prolapse (n = 20). Management included supraglottoplasty (n = 14), epiglottidectomy (n = 8) or epiglottopexy (n = 2). Neurologic etiology required tracheotomy more often than the other etiologies (n = 5, 36% vs. 15%). Three patients were managed expectantly without surgical intervention and reported symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Adult laryngomalacia is a rare diagnosis comprising a spectrum of disease. This diagnosis may be overlooked, but association with neurologic injury or trauma should encourage consideration. In comparison to pediatric laryngomalacia, patients often require surgical intervention. Surgical decision is based on the direction of supraglottic collapse, where supraglottoplasty and partial epiglottidectomy are effective interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^9827637c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Burden of dysphonia — prevalence and patterns — Analyses of a nationally representative US medical claims database in 2001 found a point prevalence of dysphonia of 0.98% (536,943 patients with dysphonia per 55,000,000 patients) in a treatment-seeking population, with higher rates among females (1.2% vs 0.7% for males) and among those > 70 years of age (2.5% vs 0.6%-1.8% for all other age groups). The point prevalence of dysphonia-related conditions is likely higher because many with voice changes are not treatment seeking, and a community survey reported a 29.9% cumulative lifetime risk of a voice disorder before 65 years of age. Common physician-assigned diagnoses included acute laryngitis, nonspecific dysphonia, benign vocal fold lesions (eg, cysts, polyps, nodules), and chronic laryngitis.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Primary presentations of laryngomalacia [^8d8c6950]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Laryngomalacia (LM) classically presents with stridor in early infancy but can present atypically with snoring and/or sleep-disordered breathing (S-SDB) or swallowing dysfunction (SwD). The epidemiology of these atypical presentations has not been established in the literature.

Objective

To document the primary modes of presentation for LM in a consecutive series of children and to compare the characteristics of each subgroup.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective case series in a single tertiary pediatric otolaryngology practice. Outpatient and surgical records were searched for patients diagnosed as having LM from 2002 to 2009. We included all children with endoscopically confirmed LM without prior documentation of the diagnosis (n = 88).

Interventions

Patients were investigated and managed according to the routine practice pattern of the senior author.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of the various primary presentations of LM. Age, sex, type of LM, management, and secondary diagnoses were also collected. Subgroup analysis was performed.

Results

Of 117 potentially eligible patients identified, 88 children had a confirmed diagnosis of LM and were thus included (1.9:1 male to female sex ratio; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [23.0] months; age range, 0.2–96.0 months). Fifty-six children (64%) presented primarily with awake stridor and variable respiratory distress; 22 (25%) with S-SDB; and 10 (11%) with SWD. The difference in mean (SD) age for each group was statistically significant by analysis of variance: stridor, 3.5 (2.8) months; S-SDB, 46.0 (27.2) months; and SwD, 4.8 (4.6) months (P < .001). By χ² analysis, sex distribution was not significantly different between subgroups (P = 0.29), nor was the proportion of children who underwent supraglottoplasty (P = 0.07). The difference in proportion of types of LM between the stridor and atypical presentations was statistically significant (χ²P < .05), with type 1 LM predominating in children presenting with S-SDB.

Conclusions and Relevance

Because LM may present primarily with S-SDB and SwD in a significant proportion of children, the diagnosis must be considered in patients presenting with these upper airway complaints. The morphologic type of LM may vary by presentation.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Estimating prevalence of rare genetic disease diagnoses using electronic health records in a children's hospital [^e4ba01d9]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

NOBLE Coder identified 89 unique ORPHA codes in the 100 random descriptions. According to the classification information from Orphanet, these codes cover all 23 disease classes by Orphanet (some diseases could be classified to multiple types, e.g. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is classified as a rare skin disease and a rare systemic and rheumatological disease).

To evaluate the performance of the mappings at the patient level, we conducted a manual chart review for 70 randomly selected patients, who, based on NOBLE Coder pipeline, had received at least one RGD diagnosis. A total of 93 diagnosis descriptions were mapped to RGDs for these patients as some patients carried multiple RGD diagnoses. For instance, one patient diagnosed with Down syndrome also had other RGD diagnoses, including atrial septal defect, congenital laryngomalacia, congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease. Out of the 93 diagnoses of RGDs, 84 (90.32%) were present in their clinical records in EPIC. When reviewing the age at diagnosis in days, it is found that 61 (65.59%) RGD diagnoses had a discrepancy less than 6 months against EPIC, and 48 (51.61%) of them were the correct time of the initial diagnosis in EPIC. At least 11 (11.82%) of the RGD diagnoses appeared to be obtained prior to visiting CCHMC, although this information was not always available in EPIC.

We examined the disease classifications of the 70 patients for their RGD diagnoses. Their diagnoses were mapped to 50 unique ORPHA codes, covering all 23 disease classes recognized by Orphanet. Furthermore, we compared the demographic information of the 70 randomly selected patients against the remaining 37,256 patients with RGD diagnoses. As shown in Table S10, no obvious bias was observed in race, gender, and age in this random set.

### Adult laryngomalacia: an uncommon clinical entity [^4ce7adf8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2002). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old female presented with a several-day history of acute onset inspiratory stridor and shortness of breath that worsened with phonation and minimal exertion. Flexible fiberoptic direct laryngoscopy revealed prolapse of the mucosa overlying the arytenoid cartilages bilaterally, consistent with type 1 laryngomalacia. These symptoms persisted with only minimal improvement despite administration of short-term corticosteroids, several weeks of antireflux medications, and other conservative measures. The patient underwent a supraglottoplasty and exhibited a marked improvement in her symptoms. The literature describes several cases of exercise-induced laryngomalacia in both pediatric and adult populations in which symptoms of inspiratory stridor and shortness of breath are induced by exercise but resolve upon its discontinuation. Adult laryngomalacia appears to be a clinical entity distinct from exercise-induced laryngomalacia because symptoms fail to resolve after several weeks of medical therapy and discontinuation of exertional activity. This case suggests that adult laryngomalacia, unlike pediatric and exercise-induced laryngomalacia, is less likely to resolve over time with conservative management and may require surgical intervention with supraglottoplasty necessary to alleviate symptoms.

### Congenital laryngomalacia is related to exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in adolescence [^9a6612ab]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Histograms for the distribution of the background and lung function variables were plotted, and visual inspection was used to ensure that t tests were appropriate when testing for differences between groups, and that means and SDs were appropriate summary statistics. Fisher's exact test was used to test categorical data. For the CLE-scores we calculated medians and IQRs, and used the Wilcoxon's rank-sum test to assess differences between the CLM and control groups. Symptoms and findings at laryngoscopy were illustrated with Venn diagrams using dichotomised terms (figure 3). Two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Secondary airway lesions in laryngomalacia: a different perspective [^39d49e85]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the prevalence of secondary airway lesions (SALs) among children with laryngomalacia (LM).

Study Design

A cross-sectional observational study.

Setting

Single practice in a tertiary care pediatric facility.

Subjects and Methods

Patients diagnosed with LM were initially identified from a prospectively kept surgical database. Patients with cardiac/large-vessel malformations, prematurity, repeated or prolonged intubations, acute infections, or prior airway surgery were excluded. Only children who had a full examination of the airway were included. Other associated diagnoses along with demographics, surgical intervention, and type of LM were included.

Results

Over an 8-year period, 1112 patients underwent laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. A total of 108 consecutive cases were diagnosed with LM (78 primary diagnosis and 30 secondary diagnosis). After excluding 17 with disorders associated with large airway disease, 91 LM patients were included. The mean age was 553.23 days (ranging between 5 days and 15 years); 60 were boys and 31 were girls. The prevalence of SALs was 7.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.65–7.76; 7 children; 4 subglottic stenosis, 4 tracheomalacia, 1 bronchomalacia, and 1 choanal atresia). Fifty-nine patients underwent supraglottoplasties, while 1 patient had a tracheostomy.

Conclusions

After accounting for conditions known to be associated with large airway lesions, the prevalence of SALs associated with laryngomalacia was much less than previously reported. The authors hypothesize that the upper-end figures are a reflection of highly select cohorts and the inclusion of patients with other pathology known to be associated with subglottic stenosis, tracheomalacia, and bronchomalacia and low thresholds for diagnosing mild subglottic stenosis.

### Identification and management of chronic laryngitis [^24dcd688]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic laryngitis is an inflammatory process of at least 3 weeks duration and affects phonation, breathing, and swallowing. This article describes the infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune causes of chronic laryngitis. Symptoms of chronic laryngitis are nonspecific and may range from mild to airway compromise requiring emergent tracheostomy.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^61e7b6a2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Statement 4B — need for laryngoscopy in persistent dysphonia — clinicians should perform laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform laryngoscopy, when dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies, expert opinion, and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade C, observational studies on the natural history of benign laryngeal disorders; grade C for observational studies plus expert opinion on defining what constitutes a serious underlying condition, with Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include avoiding missed or delayed diagnosis of serious conditions and permitting prompt assessment of the larynx when serious concern exists, whereas risks, harms, costs include potential for delay in diagnosis, procedure-related morbidity, procedure-related expense, and patient discomfort; the benefits-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note a consensus-based agreement on 4 weeks with the option to proceed more promptly based on clinical circumstances; Exclusions are none, the Policy level is Recommendation, and the role of patient preferences is limited with a serious underlying concern but moderate without one. Differences of opinions are reported regarding the time frame (4 or 6 weeks), with 10 panel members favoring a 4-week time frame and 5 favoring a 6-week time frame.

### Assessing factors related to the pharmacologic management of laryngeal diseases and disorders [^9f26ce75]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To examine how age, gender, comorbidity, geography, provider type, and laryngeal pathology influence the use of pharmacological treatment in managing patients with laryngeal disorders.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of data from a large, nationally representative, administrative, US claims database.

Methods

Patients with a laryngeal disorder based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, seen as an outpatient by a primary care physician (PCP), otolaryngologist, or both and continuously enrolled for 12 months were included. Data regarding pharmacy claims, age, gender, geographic location, comorbid conditions, provider type, and laryngeal diagnosis were collected. To identify factors that influenced whether a patient received a medication or not, a logistic regression was performed.

Results

Of almost 55 million individuals in the database, 258,705 had a laryngeal diagnosis 12 months post-index date follow-up and an outpatient encounter with a PCP, otolaryngologist, or both. A total of 135,973 (52.6%) unique patients, mean age 47.4 years (22.2 standard deviation [SD]), with 61.9% female, received a medication, and 122,732 (47.4%), mean age 47.4 years (19.8 SD), with 65.8% female, did not. Higher odds ratios for medication treatment were associated with PCPs versus otolaryngologists, acute laryngitis, the South region, and patients with comorbid conditions. Variable prescription patterns were also observed for age and gender.

Conclusions

Multiple factors are associated with the use of medical treatment for laryngeal disorders.

### The groningen laryngomalacia classification system – based on systematic review and dynamic airway changes [^ce682c3d]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of dyspnea and stridor in newborn infants. Laryngomalacia is a dynamic change of the upper airway based on abnormally pliable supraglottic structures, which causes upper airway obstruction. In the past, different classification systems have been introduced. Until now no classification system is widely accepted and applied. Our goal is to provide a simple and complete classification system based on systematic literature search and our experiences.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study with literature review.

Methods

All patients with laryngomalacia under the age of 5 at time of diagnosis were included. Photo and video documentation was used to confirm diagnosis and characteristics of dynamic airway change. Outcome was compared with available classification systems in literature.

Results

Eighty-five patients were included. In contrast to other classification systems, only three typical different dynamic changes have been identified in our series. Two existing classification systems covered 100% of our findings, but there was an unnecessary overlap between different types in most of the systems. Based on our finding, we propose a new a classification system for laryngomalacia, which is purely based on dynamic airway changes.

Conclusion

The groningen laryngomalacia classification is a new, simplified classification system with three types, based on purely dynamic laryngeal changes, tested in a tertiary referral center: Type 1: inward collapse of arytenoids cartilages, Type 2: medial displacement of aryepiglottic folds, and Type 3: posterocaudal displacement of epiglottis against the posterior pharyngeal wall.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Prevalence and causes of dysphonia in a large treatment-seeking population [^4977fa03]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine the prevalence and common causes of dysphonia as diagnosed by primary care physicians (PCPs) and otolaryngologists and to evaluate differences in etiologies offered by these providers.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of data from a large, nationally representative administrative U.S. claims database.

Methods

Patients were identified as dysphonic based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2008. Data regarding age, sex, geographic location, and type of physician providing the dysphonia diagnosis were collected. Overall and age-related prevalence rates, as well as frequency of specific etiologies by provider type, were calculated.

Results

Of the almost 55 million individuals in the database, 536,943 patients (ages 0 to > 65 years) were given a dysphonia diagnosis (point prevalence rate of 0.98%). The prevalence rate was higher among females as compared to males (1.2% vs. 0.7%) and among those > 70 years of age (2.5%). The most frequent diagnoses overall were acute laryngitis, nonspecific dysphonia, benign vocal fold lesions, and chronic laryngitis. PCPs more commonly diagnosed acute laryngitis, whereas otolaryngologists more commonly diagnosed nonspecific dysphonia and laryngeal pathology. Gastroesophageal reflux was more commonly diagnosed as a comorbid condition by otolaryngologists than by PCPs. Overall laryngeal cancer prevalence in this treatment-seeking population was 2.2% and was greatest among males > 70 years of age.

Conclusions

This analysis of insurance claims data from a nationally representative database represents the largest study of its kind. Important differences in dysphonia prevalence related to age, sex, diagnosis, and physician type were identified.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^c82b13da]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination elements for dysphonia: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians identify the underlying cause of dysphonia, and careful history and physical examination provide important clues to the underlying etiology and can help direct management. The larynx is described as a physiologically complex organ at the intersection of the upper respiratory tract and esophageal inlet, exposed to a variety of pathogens and noxious irritants and at risk for iatrogenic injury, so potential etiologies are very broad and include traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, neurologic, metabolic, neoplastic, congenital, and behavioral factors. The history should include duration, type of onset, potential inciting events, how the condition is affecting the patient, associated symptoms, modifying factors, current medications, habits, concurrent medical conditions, and prior surgery; careful evaluation allows the clinician to categorize dysphonia severity, develop a treatment plan, and prioritize patients who may need escalated care.

### Pediatric laryngotracheal obstruction: current perspectives on stridor [^9ede8bf8]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To assess how medical advances have impacted the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of pediatric laryngotracheal obstruction, and to describe the advantages of audio-video documentation of stridorous children.

Study Design and Methods

Retrospective.

Methods and Materials

268 patients were referred for suspected laryngotracheal obstruction during the 30 months between September 1, 1995 and March 1, 1998: 173 had 206 flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopies, and 160 had 273 direct laryngoscopies. One hundred and forty-one children were identified with laryngotracheal obstruction, yielding 40 different diagnoses that could be classified into 9 major categories. Thirty-six children (25.5%) had multiple sites of upper airway obstruction.

Results

138 children had follow-up > 1 month. Twelve children died (8.7%), leaving 126 survivors (mean follow-up = 21.1 months). Outcomes were classified as resolved (44.2%), improved (37.0%), stable (9.4%), failed (0.7%), or death (8.7%). Better outcomes were seen in more readily treated diagnostic categories, such as tracheobronchial foreign body, chronic laryngitis, and suprastomal granulation tissue; laryngeal stenosis, tracheomalacia, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, had less favorable outcomes (P < .001). The former group also showed superior outcome compared to laryngomalacia (P < .001) and vocal cord mobility disorders (P = 0.004). Ninety-four patients (68.1%) had comorbidities complicating their management. Comorbid conditions were universal among deceased patients and least common in the resolved outcomes category (56.7%), supporting the premise that patients with poor outcomes are more likely to have comorbidities than patients with resolution of laryngotracheal symptoms (P = 0.034).

Conclusions

Audio-video recording of pediatric laryngotracheal obstruction offers numerous advantages. Children classified into an array of diagnostic categories usually have favorable outcomes, but opportunities for continued advances exist, particularly regarding management of comorbidity and chronic obstruction.

### Specificity of international classification of diseases codes for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: an investigation using electronic health record data and a large insurance database [^14631499]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes in electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for health services research, in spite of unknown diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy of ICD codes to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study in a single-center NICU (n = 166) to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of ICD-10 codes for the diagnosis of BPD. Analysis of large insurance claims database (n = 7887) to determine date of assignment of the code.

Results

The sensitivity of any BPD-related ICD codes ranged from 0.82 to 0.95, while the specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.36. In a large national insurance database, the most common date of ICD-9 or ICD-10 code assignment was the day of birth, which is inconsistent with the clinical definition.

Conclusions

ICD codes registered for BPD are unlikely to accurately reflect the current clinical definition and should be interpreted with caution.

### Resource utilization in the management of subglottic stenosis [^335b13fa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine resource utilization in managing subglottic stenosis.

Study Design

The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) 2003 was analyzed.

Subjects and Methods

International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 478.74 was the inclusion criteria.

Results

Two thousand forty-six admissions with subglottic stenosis were sampled; there were 10 deaths (0.49%). States with the most admissions were Ohio, California, and Illinois; these did not have the highest spending per admission. Two hundred eighteen (10.7%) underwent a laryngeal graft procedure; states with the most were Ohio (35.8%), Texas, California, and Florida. Indicators of increased resource utilization include length of stay, nonelective admission, race, primary payer, hospital location, and type.

Conclusions

For subglottic stenosis, three states account for 37% of admissions, and four states account for 56% of laryngeal graft procedures in 2003. The mean total charges were $53,787; 90% of admissions had total charges less than $139,253. Patients who underwent surgical procedures had total charges of $76,409.

### Congenital laryngomalacia is related to exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction in adolescence [^c2254c43]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Congenital laryngomalacia (CLM) is the most common cause of inspiratory stridor in infants, and is characterised by dynamic inward folding of the supraglottic part of the larynx during inspiration. The characteristic low-pitched stridor, inspiratory retractions and feeding difficulties typically appear during the first few weeks of life and flexible laryngoscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. The pathophysiology of CLM is not well understood, but various forms of anatomical, physiological or neuromuscular laryngeal abnormalities have been suggested. Surgical treatment is indicated when the obstruction compromises ventilation to the extent that it causes failure to thrive, which occurs in a minority of cases. Thus, for most patients, CLM is considered a benign and self-limiting condition, and the literature proposes that breathing difficulties resolve by the age of 12–24 months. Although cases of stridor may persist beyond this age, few studies have addressed long-term outcomes from CLM.

Exercise-induced inspiratory symptoms (EIIS) is increasingly recognised as an important differential diagnosis to exercise-induced asthma in otherwise healthy adolescents.EIIS is most often linked to laryngeal abnormalities, and if so, often labelled exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO). In unselected populations, EILO has been found in 7.5% and 5.7% of adolescents. Causal mechanisms remain unclear, but abnormalities related to the epiglottis, the laryngeal cartilage skeleton or its support, mucosal or muscular structures may all conceivably disturb airflow, increase the turbulence and airflow resistance and thereby explain the symptoms. Smith et al suggested a relation between CLM and later EILO, and introduced the term exercise-induced laryngomalacia.

The aims of the present study were to assess adolescents hospitalised for CLM in infancy with respect to respiratory symptoms and laryngeal abnormalities by means of questionnaires, spirometry and laryngoscopy performed at rest and during exercise. Findings were compared with control subjects with no previous history of CLM.

### Resource utilization and national demographics of laryngotracheal trauma in children [^26d4dc19]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Pediatric laryngotracheal trauma is rare but can carry considerable morbidity and health care resource expenditure. However, the true cost of these injuries has not been thoroughly investigated.

Objective

To use a national administrative pediatric database to identify normative data on pediatric laryngotracheal trauma, specifically with regard to cost and resource utilization.

Design and Participants

Retrospective medical record review using the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) 2009. Inclusion criteria were admissions with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes for fractures or open wounds of the larynx and trachea.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Among many data analyzed were demographic information and admission characteristics, including length of stay, diagnoses, procedures performed, and total charges.

Results

There were 106 admissions that met inclusion criteria. Patient mean (SE) age was 15.9 (0.45) years, and 79% were males. The mean (SE) length of stay (LOS) was 8.4 (1.1) days; more than 50% of patients had a LOS longer than 4 days. The mean number of diagnoses per patient was 6.9 (0.6); other traumatic injuries included pneumothorax (n = 18). More than 75% of patients underwent more than 2 procedures during their admission; 60.2% underwent a major operative procedure. The most common procedures performed were laryngoscopy (n = 54) and operative repair of the larynx and/or trachea (n = 32). Tracheostomy was performed in only 30 patients. The mean (SE) total charge was $90,879 ($11,419), and one-third of patients had total charges more than $100,000.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pediatric laryngotracheal trauma remains a relatively rare clinical entity. These injuries primarily affect older children and are associated with long hospitalizations, multiple procedures, and high resource utilization.

### Inpatient outcomes among children with down syndrome: a kids' inpatient database study [^b081990c]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study utilized hospital discharge data from children under 21 years of age, covering the years 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2019, sourced from the US Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). The KID is an administrative database that includes a stratified sample of pediatric discharges from all short-term, nonfederal, general, and specialty hospitals involved in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). It contains sampling weights to produce national estimates of annual pediatric hospitalizations, outcomes, and healthcare costs. KID data are released every three years, each sample containing about 3 million pediatric discharges from participating states. The KID contains event-level data for each admission, including diagnostic and procedural codes; however, the absence of unique identifiers prevents the tracking of repeated admissions for the same individuals. Since all data collected were deidentified, IRB submission and approval were not required.

Children with DS were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10-CM) codes 758.0 and Q90.0-Q90.9.

A detailed description of the KID database, study design, and statistical analyses were reported in our previous studies.

Measurements of variables

The analyses included the following patient characteristics: age, sex, race, type of insurance (e.g. Medicare/Medicaid), and median household income quartiles based on counties of residence. In accordance with KID's reporting method, Hispanics are categorized as a race rather than an ethnicity. The analyses also considered hospital characteristics, such as hospital region, teaching status, and categorical hospital size based on the hospital's location. Using previously validated diagnostic codes, DS-associated comorbidities were identified, including prematurity, OSA, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart diseases, arrhythmia, congenital airway anomalies, laryngeal, glottic, and subglottic stenosis (LGSS), which were grouped under the same ICD-9/10 codes of 478.74 and J38.6, as well as hypothyroidism, leukemia, Hirschsprung's disease, dysphagia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

### Predictors of recurrent wheezing in late preterm infants [^d54d23b2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study design and patient population

This retrospective chart review included late preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks gestational age who received treatment at Nationwide Children's Hospital from 2013 to 2016 who developed recurrent wheezing during the first 3 years of life. This cohort was ascertained through an electronic medical record review of all infants admitted to Nationwide Children's Hospital's neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) over the designated 3-year period with a gestational age of 32–36 weeks. A 3-year follow-up period was selected to assess risk factors before school entry. Any infants with co-morbid conditions including BPD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, aspiration, tracheobronchomalacia, tracheostomy dependence, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, epilepsy, congenital heart disease, genetic diseases, or identified congenital anomalies were excluded from the study. These comorbidities were identified by the presence of international classification of diseases (ICD-10 th revision) codes for the diagnoses within the electronic medical record. Late preterm infants without any comorbid diagnoses were separated into two groups: those who developed recurrent wheezing and those who did not. Recurrent wheezing was defined as having two or more healthcare visits using ICD-10 codes for wheezing, reactive airway disease, wheezing-associated respiratory infection, or asthma at any point during the first 3 years of life. The healthcare visits included emergency department, urgent care, subspecialty clinic, and primary care provider visits, but the specific visit type was not captured for this review. This recurrent wheezing group was compared to the remaining group of late preterm infants born during the same time frame who did not meet the criteria for the development of recurrent wheezing. A patient database was created to collect demographic and clinical information via electronic medical record chart review for both groups.

Classification of evidence-based statements — Guideline development emphasizes explicit links between evidence and statements and clarifies expected practice variability: Guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harm, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined; evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that are anticipated when the statement is followed; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" as compared with a "recommendation", while "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability; clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Laryngomalacia and swallow dysfunction [^a0cfdd46]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Laryngomalacia is an established cause of stridor and sleep-disordered breathing in children. However, the relationship between laryngomalacia and dysphagia has not been well characterized. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the patient characteristics, symptoms, and prevalence of dysphagia in children with laryngomalacia and (2) examine the effectiveness of supraglottoplasty in improving feeding.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients with laryngomalacia who underwent a modified barium swallow study (MBSS) at a tertiary academic pediatric medical center between March 1, 2014, and March 1, 2018. Patients were excluded if they did not undergo a MBSS. Comorbidities, airway and feedings symptoms, MBSS results, and surgical history were recorded from each patient's electronic medical record.

Results

Forty-four children met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The median age at presentation was 96 days. There was a male predominance (66%). About one-third had a genetic or neuromuscular comorbidity. Most children had stridor (93%) and feeding difficulty (86%), while 50% had parent-reported poor weight gain. Fifty-seven percent of patients had evidence of penetration or aspiration on MBSS. All patients with a positive MBSS had dysphagia symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of patients underwent supraglottoplasty. Postoperatively, 92% reported improvement in dysphagia symptoms.

Conclusion

Dysphagia is prevalent among a subset of children with laryngomalacia. Symptomatic children may benefit from a swallow evaluation to help determine the need for further intervention. Children who undergo supraglottoplasty for laryngomalacia have improved dysphagia at follow-up, though the amount of improvement directly attributable to surgery is unclear and warrants further investigation.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^7746a97f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline purpose and scope — The primary purpose is to improve the quality of care for patients with dysphonia, based on current best evidence, with specific objectives to reduce excessive variation in care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm. The guideline focuses on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities and is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing all patients with dysphonia; it is not intended to be a tool to be utilized by third-party payers to define or deny reimbursement. In this context, the purpose is to define actions that clinicians can take, regardless of discipline, to deliver quality care, and the statements are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on assessment of individual patients.

### Association between acid reflux medication and supraglottoplasty in infant laryngomalacia [^29185d9c]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Acid suppression therapy is frequently administered to infants with laryngomalacia presenting with stridor despite limited evidence in the literature reporting its efficacy for this subset of patients.

Objective

To evaluate the frequency of supraglottoplasty in infants with nonsevere laryngomalacia treated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) medications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included infants younger than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of nonsevere laryngomalacia initially managed with either watchful waiting or GERD medications. Patients were recruited from 2014 to 2023 to a pediatric otolaryngology airway clinic at a tertiary care pediatric hospital.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the frequency of supraglottoplasty following nonsurgical management. Patients with nonsevere laryngomalacia were divided into 2 groups based on whether their laryngomalacia was managed with GERD medication therapy or observation alone. The aim was to assess the difference in supraglottoplasty rates between these 2 groups.

Results

The medical records of 395 infants younger than 6 months (171 female, 224 male) with nonsevere laryngomalacia managed with observation after their initial otolaryngology evaluation were analyzed: observation (n = 320) and trial of GERD medications (n = 75). Baseline characteristics between the observation and GERD medication groups were similar. The overall supraglottoplasty rate was 4.1% (16/395), with a small increase in the use of surgical treatment between the observation and GERD medication cohorts (3.4% vs 6.7%; difference, -3.2% [95% CI, -10% to 3.6%]). The imprecision in the estimate prevents making a definitive conclusion regarding the observed difference.

Conclusions

This study found that rates of supraglottoplasty in infants with nonsevere laryngomalacia with GERD managed with GERD medications were similar to those without reflux managed with watchful waiting. Female sex and severity of laryngomalacia based on endoscopic examination were the best predictors of receipt of supraglottoplasty after a period of watchful waiting.

Dysphonia research needs — priority areas include escalation of care and antireflux definitions. For escalation and laryngoscopy, "Little is known about the natural history of voice disorders; thus, research is needed to better understand the normal course of these conditions to determine when and if early referral is helpful and/or if early intervention (eg, voice therapy, medical management, surgery) is effective at increasing the QOL or reducing health consequences related to other underlying conditions". The guideline states that "A needs exists to better define what "warning signs" and indications should prompt early referral for laryngoscopy" and that "Moreover, education and dissemination of these "warning signs" and indications are important, and effective approaches should be investigated". For laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), "There is a need for a consistent "gold standard" definition of what constitutes LPR to reduce heterogeneity among comparative studies" to enable "better estimates of disease burden and the degree of association with dysphonia".

### Long-term aerodigestive morbidities after esophageal atresia / tracheoesophageal fistula repair [^db62571c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Short-term complications, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and anastomotic stricture, are well documented in esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) survivors; however, long-term aerodigestive morbidities remain poorly understood. This study evaluated the long-term aerodigestive morbidities of EA/TEF survivors through propensity-matched analysis using a large international electronic health record (EHR) database.

Methods

EA/TEF cases from 2004 to 2024 were identified in the TriNetX EHR database, which encompasses over 100 million patients from 86 international healthcare organizations. Cases were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9/10 codes and compared with a matched control group based on age, race, ethnicity, and sex. Outcomes were analyzed using the chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier morbidity curves, and subgroup analysis was used to assess differences in patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD).

Results

Among the 5368 identified patients with EA/TEF, 5052 were included in the analysis (median age, 13 years; interquartile range: 8–18 years). EA/TEF survivors had significantly higher rates of asthma (28% vs. 9%, p < 0.0001), tracheomalacia (29% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), pneumonia (31% vs. 11%, p < 0.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (13% vs. 2%, p < 0.001), GERD (50% vs. 5%, p < 0.001), esophageal dyskinesia (8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), esophageal stricture (32% vs. 0%, p < 0.001), and esophageal dilations (15% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) than controls did. Moreover, there was increasing divergence (p < 0.001) of combined aerodigestive morbidity rates between the EA/TEF and control groups over long-term follow up. CHD emerged as an independent risk factor for increased esophageal and respiratory morbidity (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These findings underscore the significant long-term aerodigestive morbidities in EA/TEF survivors, particularly those with CHD, highlighting the need for lifelong surveillance and targeted management to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^3e57c501]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Importantly, the CCC v2 system can be implemented for either the ICD-9 or the ICD-10 coding scheme. With the mandated transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding schemes for medical diagnoses and procedures, the CCC v2 system provides a necessary update. We tested the comparability of CCC v2 between ICD-9 and ICD-10, and found no significant discrepancies in CCC categories between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 schemes. We also examined the temporal trends of CCC categories attributable to cause of death during 1991–2010, and did not find any drastic changes at the 1999 time point, when ICD-10 coding was implemented, and no discontinuities in long-term time trends.

We did observe minor declines in the cardiovascular and respiratory CCC categories in the CDC Multiple Cause of Death 1991–2010, which corresponded with a reduction in overall population death rates in heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which have been attributed in part to reductions in tobacco use, but for pediatric patients, are more likely due to improved cardiac and pulmonary care. The minor increases in the congenital/genetic CCC were most likely related to improved diagnostic capabilities, such as the improved detection of genetic diseases through advancements in newborn screening processes. Nevertheless, none of these trends demonstrated substantial shifts over the 20-year period. This suggests that CCC v2 has close comparability between ICD-9 and ICD-10, and that the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 is unlikely to substantially change CCC v2 proportions, or cause a significant discontinuity in time trends.

### Laryngomalacia and swallowing function in children [^e04b7f14]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

1) To determine the prevalence of dysphagia in children with laryngomalacia, 2) To ascertain whether severity of laryngomalacia influences the presence of swallowing dysfunction, and 3) To examine whether patients with medical comorbidities and laryngomalacia have a higher prevalence of swallowing dysfunction.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

All patients seen in the aerodigestive center at our institution between January 2007 and December 2012 with the diagnosis of laryngomalacia were included. Swallowing function was assessed by symptoms, clinical swallowing evaluations (CSE) performed by speech pathologists, modified barium swallow (MBS) studies, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluations of swallowing (FEES).

Results

There were 324 patients with laryngomalacia identified (41.4% female, 58.6% male). Severity of laryngomalacia was categorized in 279 patients, with 62.7% mild, 28.7% moderate, and 8.6% severe. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was diagnosed in 69.8% of patients. Other medical comorbidities included Down syndrome (3.1%), neurological impairment (6.5%), and congenital heart disease (0.9%). Symptoms of dysphagia or feeding difficulty were present in 163/324 (50.3%), and failure to thrive was present in 31/324 patients (9.6%). At least one abnormal swallowing assessment was present in 97/120 (80.8%) patients presenting with subjective dysphagia and 43/65 (66.2%) patients without subjective dysphagia. A total of 140/185 (75.7%) patients had at least one abnormal baseline swallowing assessment. There was no significant relationship between severity of laryngomalacia and presence of abnormal swallowing function based on symptoms, CSE, MBS, or FEES. However, patients with greater severity were more likely to have failure to thrive. There was not a significant association between the presence of swallowing dysfunction or disease severity and medical comorbidities such as Down syndrome, neurological impairment, or congenital heart disease. However, GERD was more likely to be present in patients with moderate and severe laryngomalacia than in patients with mild disease.

Conclusions

Swallowing dysfunction is common in children with laryngomalacia regardless of disease severity or other medical comorbidities. Swallowing studies are frequently abnormal in laryngomalacia patients presenting both with and without subjective symptoms of dysphagia. Dysphagia assessment should be considered as part of the evaluation of infants with laryngomalacia.

### Management of laryngomalacia in children with congenital syndrome: the role of supraglottoplasty [^387499f5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Importance

Supraglottoplasty is the surgical procedure of choice for severe laryngomalacia and has shown to be successful in most cases; however, patients with medical comorbidities present a higher rate of failure. To date, the best management of laryngomalacia in children with congenital syndrome remains unclear.

Purpose

To study the outcome of supraglottoplasty in children with severe laryngomalacia, and to analyze the management and outcome in infants with a congenital syndrome.

Methods

Retrospective medical records review from January 2003 to October 2012 of all patients who underwent laser supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia at the University Children's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.

Results

Thirty-one patients were included; median age at time of surgery was 3.5 months. Three patients (10%) had a genetically proven congenital syndrome with associated neurologic anomalies. Overall success rate was 87%. Failures were observed in four (13%) of 31 cases; including all three patients presenting a congenital syndrome.

Conclusions

Supraglottoplasty is an effective and safe treatment for laryngomalacia in otherwise healthy children. Signs of a possible underlying predominant neurologic origin and discrepancy between the clinical presentation and the endoscopic findings have to be taken into account, as in children with congenital syndrome with neurologic anomalies the risk of failure is higher.

### Chronic conditions in children and young people: learning from administrative data [^cebbd0f7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Evaluating chronic conditions in hospital administrative data

Evidence on healthcare utilisation is rapidly emerging as a result of the improving quality, standardisation and longevity of administrative healthcare data. In Western Australia, Canada, Scotland and the Nordic countries, administrative healthcare data have been routinely collated over decades, making it possible to evaluate patterns of healthcare for children with chronic conditions from birth to adulthood at a fraction of the cost of traditional cohort studies. Of all types of healthcare data, hospital administrative data, which primarily record hospital activity for reimbursement and commissioning purposes, are the most standardised and comprehensive across many healthcare systems and they are usually longitudinal, meaning that episodes of care for the same patient are linked over time. Many of these databases record diagnoses in the form of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. In the National Health Service (NHS), these codes are entered by professional coders based on hospital discharge records. We can use these codes to identify chronic conditions in hospital administrative data to measure the changing burden of chronic conditions over time, between countries and between regions or hospitals.

Different classifications for chronic conditions in children have been developed in the UK and the USA (box 1), though both produce similar proportions of chronic conditions for some groups of children (figure 1). These classifications offer a starting point for studying chronic conditions in children, but more studies are needed that validate these and other classifications and how they vary.

Box 1
Classifications to identify chronic conditions in hospital administrative data

Hardelid classification

Definition of chronic condition: Any health problem requiring clinical follow-up for > 12 months in 50% or more of cases. Medical follow-up was defined as repeated hospital admission, specialist follow-up through outpatient department visits or use of support services such as physiotherapy or speech and language therapy.

Data sources: Hospital administrative data for England and death registrations.

Coding system: International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, grouped into eight mutually exclusive body system categories and including additional generic codes (eg, gastrostomy feeding). Examples of conditions include cerebral palsy, epilepsy, learning disability, asthma, self-harm.

### Collaboration between specialties for respiratory allergies in the international classification of diseases (ICD)-11 [^621bb5c6]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Many international initiatives have been launched to prevent and decrease the negative outcome of these conditions, which are considered a global health problem. However, international classification and coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have grouped them under topographic distribution, regardless of the underlying mechanisms and triggers. This has led to the framework of both the 10th and draft 11th revisions of ICD (ICD-10 2010 version and ICD-11 beta draft as at May 2014 respectively) to be deficient in capturing the concepts currently in use for allergic and hypersensitivity conditions. These findings highlight the need for the major respiratory societies to be involved in updating the representation of allergic and hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract in the ongoing ICD-11 revision.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^e91b5130]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Persistent dysphonia — supporting timing and care patterns — reports that symptoms from viral laryngitis typically last 1 to 3 weeks and then resolve spontaneously, so initial observation for most patients with new-onset dysphonia is reasonable and persistence beyond this period raises concern for other pathologies. Delays are common, with most patients with dysphonia waiting between 88.7 and 119.2 days before seeking treatment and a survey of primary care providers finding that 64% preferred to treat rather than refer a patient with chronic dysphonia (> 6 weeks). The guideline text urges referral based on evidence suggesting that referral for careful laryngeal visualization results in shorter time to disease resolution and is more cost-effective than continued treatment without identification of an underlying etiology. Care patterns further note that a majority of patients (90%) with a complaint of hoarseness initially present to primary care, while otolaryngologists ultimately see between 3% and 10% of initial dysphonia consultations.

3 Results

Figure 1 summarizes the outcome selection process. Our initial list of outcomes for Delphi Round 1 comprised 42 items (Figure 1), (see Table 1). We recruited 1067 participants to the Delphi International expert panel: 974 (91.2%) people living with LTS or family member/friend, 68 (6.0%) clinician researchers, 16 (1.0%) clinicians, and 9 (0.8%) researchers. Participant characteristics are presented in Table 2. Of these 42 outcomes, 14 (33.3%) met consensus criteria by all four stakeholder groups (Table 1). Ten outcomes were added by participants (Figure 1), and therefore, a total of 52 outcomes were voted on twice across the modified Delphi process. Item generation and reduction for the additional outcomes are described in Table S1. In round 2, there were 575 participants, 53.8% of the round 1 participants: 39 (6.8%) clinician researchers, 12 clinicians (2.1%), 518 people living with LTS (90.1%), and 6 researchers (1.0%). From the two rounds of voting, 27 outcomes met the criterion (Table 3) and were taken forward to the consensus meetings. Scores across all outcomes and groups are described in Table S2. Seventeen experts attended the two consensus meetings, including 6 (35.2%) people living with LTS (Table 2).

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Characterizing disease severity through surgical recurrence rates in idiopathic subglottic stenosis [^d08a5205]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

A disease classification system in iSGS that uses intervals contained within a 5‐year surgery rate to categorize patients into three separate groups with worsening disease severity demonstrated near identical proportions across institutions. The 2‐year surgery rate starting from a patient's first treatment appears particularly valuable in showing the proportion of patients who will be classified into Group A, the mildest form of the disease, and those who will remain surgery free. This information is beneficial for patient counseling and should spur further work in classifying disease severity for a condition that currently is unpredictable in response to treatment.

Follow-up and Mortality Outcomes

We followed participants for mortality from survey administration through the end of 2011, and approximately 47 000 deaths occurred during follow-up. In addition to all-cause mortality, we defined underlying cause of death according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes as follows: all cancers (ICD-10 codes C00-C97), smoking-related cancers (lip, oral cavity, and pharynx [ICD-10 codes C00-C14]; esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, and pancreas [ICD-10 codes C15, C16, C18-C21, C22, and C25]; larynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung [ICD-10 codes C32 and C33-C34]; cervix, kidney, bladder [ICD-10 codes C53, C64-C65, and C67], and myeloid leukemia [ICD-10 code C92]), circulatory diseases (ICD-10 codes I00-I09, I20-I25, I26-I28, I29-I51, I60-I69, I70, and I71, I72-I78), cerebrovascular disease (ICD-10 codes I60-I69), respiratory disease including influenza, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ICD-10 codes J10-J11, J12-J18, J40-J42, J43, and J44), and all other causes.

### Congenital subglottic cyst: a rare cause for sudden airway compromise in a newborn [^163a9b7d]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A full-term infant developed stridor, respiratory distress and hypercarbia shortly after birth requiring urgent airway intervention. The patient underwent urgent intubation via rigid bronchoscopy. The diagnosis of congenital subglottic cyst was made. The cyst was decompressed and the patient was extubated the following day. On repeat laryngoscopy 1 month later, there was no residual disease and the patient remained symptom free. Congenital subglottic cysts are extremely rare and the diagnosis can be either missed or misdiagnosed with more common causes of stridor, such as laryngomalacia. Subglottic cysts may cause total airway obstruction and even death if they are large enough and not treated immediately.

### Medical and surgical management of congenital laryngomalacia: a case-control study [^8abb490a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the growth of infants with moderate to severe laryngomalacia who underwent supraglottoplasty to the growth of those treated with medical therapy alone.

Study Design

Case-control study of patients treated between 2008 and 2013.

Setting

Tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology practice.

Subjects and Methods

Fifty-one infants newly diagnosed with moderate to severe congenital laryngomalacia. Seventeen infants underwent supraglottoplasty and 34 matched controls had medical management, which included acid suppression therapy, speech and swallowing therapy, and/or high-calorie formula. The primary outcome measure was weight percentile recorded at the second clinic visit and at the last available follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the need for primary or revision supraglottoplasty, tracheostomy or gastrostromy, or the development of or persistence of failure to thrive.

Results

There was no difference in the mean weight percentile between the surgical and nonsurgical groups at the time of last follow-up (P = 0.89). The mean change in weight percentile during the study period was 32% (95% CI, 15%-48%) in the supraglottoplasty group and 31% (95% CI, 22%-40%) in the medical group (P = 0.97). Five of 5 (100%) patients with failure to thrive managed surgically and 10 of 10 (100%) managed medically were above the fifth percentile at the end of the follow-up period. One (3%) patient in the medical management group required tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement.

Conclusions

Medical management and close observation of infants with moderate to severe congenital laryngomalacia may be a viable alternative to supraglottoplasty in appropriately selected infants.

### Laryngeal structural dysphagia in children [^4b3ab067]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The upper aerodigestive system is closely intertwined from an embryologic and functional perspective. Laryngotracheal anatomic abnormalities, such as laryngomalacia, stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, and laryngeal clefts, affect not only the respiratory function but also the swallow function. Laryngotracheal pathology can interfere with the suck-swallow-breathe mechanism in infants. It can also exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux. Chronic aspiration secondary to laryngotracheal anomalies can result in respiratory and pulmonary complications. Surgical treatment of laryngotracheal anomalies can also cause transient or long-term swallow dysfunction. Multidisciplinary approaches and clinical assessment of swallowing are important in patients with laryngotracheal pathology.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^00650e21]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Three prospective studies reported flexible bronchoscopy findings in preterm infants. Among 174 preterm infants undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, 7.5% had subglottic cysts. Another study of 117 preterm infants identified TBM or subglottic stenosis (SGS) in 48 patients (15 with moderate/severe SGS; 19 with moderate/severe malacia, and two with both). Flexible bronchoscopy of 13 mechanically ventilated preterm infants revealed vocal cord nodules (62%) and airway malacia (31%).

Four studies focused on flexible laryngoscopy used to identify LVCP in preterm infants after PDA ligation. A meta-analysis (33 studies; n = 4,887) showed an 11% incidence of LVCP in preterm infants, which was associated with an increased risk of BPD, gastrostomy, and mechanical ventilation days. A retrospective study showed that 22 of 55 extremely preterm infants had LVCP after PDA ligation. Those with LVCP were more likely to develop BPD, reactive airway disease, and gastrostomy dependence, suggesting that flexible laryngoscopy be considered for patients with respiratory or feeding difficulties after PDA ligation. A study of 23 preterm infants after PDA ligation and 12 matched preterm control subjects reported that 12 of 23 had LVCP after PDA ligation, with seven showing signs of aspiration. Finally, a study examining long-term morbidities in preterm infants after PDA ligation noted that 44% had LVCP, with most requiring gastrostomies.

One study examined the benefit of DLB in addition to flexible laryngoscopy for 532 patients with aspiration (mean age at enrollment, 2.2 yr; 131 preterm). Flexible laryngoscopy enabled identification of 93 patients with airway lesions, whereas DLB enabled identification of 173 additional lesions (136 laryngeal clefts, 40 laryngomalacia cases, 25 vocal fold immobility cases, 22 tracheomalacia cases [with 6 also showing laryngomalacia], 12 SGS cases, three H-type tracheoesophageal fistulae, and 2 glottic webs), with 66.3% requiring surgical intervention.

Certainty of evidence

The panel's confidence in the accuracy of these estimated effects for the utility of airway endoscopy for critical outcomes was very low. Small, observational studies often lacked a comparison group. The mode of endoscopy (flexible laryngoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, DLB) differed between studies, limiting generalizability.

### Congenital subglottic cyst: a rare cause for sudden airway compromise in a newborn [^c3655607]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Subglottic cysts are retention cysts of subepithelial mucosal glands, which may be either congenital or acquired. Subglottic cysts are rare and occur at a rate of ~1.8/100 000 live births. The incidence of subglottic cysts is increasing and is thought to be secondary to the increased survival rates of premature infants. These premature infants frequently require prolonged duration of tracheal intubation (a known mechanism for the formation of acquired subglottic cysts). The mechanism is however not completely understood. Acquired cysts are presumed to be iatrogenic and secondary to repetitive piston trauma of the endotracheal tube and ventilator on subglottic mucosa. This may result in the blockage of the subglottic ducts as a result of erosion and subsequent scarring. In contrast, congenital subglottic cysts can occur in term neonates with no previous airway intervention. The subglottic region is the narrowest segment of the paediatric airway, and therefore narrowing secondary to either acquired or congenital subglottic cysts has the potential to cause rapidly progressive respiratory distress and complete airway obstruction.

The non-specific symptoms related to subglottic cysts may present a diagnostic challenge. A high index of suspicion is required to ensure appropriate and timely investigation and treatment. Common symptoms include dysphonia, dysphagia, hoarseness, stridor and dyspnoea. All of which are easier to detect in older children. This condition may be misdiagnosed as laryngomalacia, croup or subglottic stenosis, due to the similar characteristic features and the relative rarity of the congenital subglottic cysts. Diagnostic laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are therefore routinely indicated for airway evaluation in at-risk infants.

There are, however, certain features in the history and examination to assist clinicians in differentiating these conditions. Stridor implies a narrowing in a level of the laryngotracheal pathway. Stridor during inspiration suggests obstruction above the vocal cords, in conditions such as laryngomalacia and vallecula cysts. A biphasic stridor is more typical of obstruction at the level of the vocal cords or subglottic, which may be present in conditions such as unilateral and bilateral vocal cord palsy, subglottic stenosis and subglottic cysts. Expiratory stridor is commonly associated with obstruction at the level of the trachea, in conditions such as tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis and vascular rings.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

A Classification according to type, grade and site of stenosis proposed from Freitag et al. adapted from. B Qualitative and quantitative classification proposed by Murgu and Colt, adapted from

In 2010, Murgu and Colt made a different proposal, where a qualitative and quantitative classification was considered. The gaps observed in Freitag et al. classification were also filled (Fig. 1 B). The idea of creating an ideal and reproductive classification for CAO has not yet been fully completed and consensus has not yet been reached. In the future, ongoing studies will standardize nomenclatures and find descriptors that include the degree of stenosis and patient´s functional status, histologic and morphologic types, extension, localization, and mechanism of obstruction.

The European Laryngological Society (ELS) published a consensus paper in 2015 that offered a new classification system of benign laryngo-tracheal stenosis (LTS) in adults and children. It included a routine five-step endoscopic evaluation of patients, to assess the grade of stenosis (Cotton– Myer grade I–IV), number of subsites involved ("a–d" for one to four of supraglottic, glottic, subglottic, and tracheal segments involved), and an additional plus sign ("+") for patients with severe airway or medical comorbidities. The focus of this classification was to access the surgical outcome of patients with LTS.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^10774d8e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Airway endoscopy in post-prematurity respiratory disease (PPRD) is supported by observational data across flexible bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, and direct laryngobronchoscopy (DLB), with "11 observational studies" identified. In bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), malacia was found in "Three hundred fifty-three of 974 infants with BPD (36.2%)" undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, and among severe BPD cases "In 20 of 27 infants" airway pathologies included "tracheomalacia (48%), bronchomalacia (40.7%), and airway edema (48%)", with changes in management in "63%". In prospective cohorts, one study of preterm infants reported "Another study of 117 preterm infants identified TBM or subglottic stenosis (SGS) in 48 patients", and in ventilated preterm infants flexible bronchoscopy revealed "vocal cord nodules (62%) and airway malacia (31%)". After patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation, flexible laryngoscopy detected left vocal cord paralysis (LVCP): a meta-analysis reported "(33 studies; n = 4,887)" with an "11% incidence of LVCP", and single-center series found "22 of 55" extremely preterm infants with LVCP and, in another, "12 of 23 had LVCP… with seven showing signs of aspiration", while a long-term study noted "44% had LVCP, with most requiring gastrostomies". For children with aspiration, adding DLB to flexible laryngoscopy evaluated "532 patients (mean age at enrollment, 2.2 yr; 131 preterm)", where flexible laryngoscopy identified 93 patients with lesions and DLB identified "173 additional lesions… " across specific types, with "66.3% requiring surgical intervention".

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^29fe231f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Taxonomy and terminology of UCTS and related diagnoses

UCTS involves diverse symptom presentations, in the absence of structural causes, and encompasses divergent aetiological theories and specialty approaches. This clinical dilemma is the subject of highly divided terminology and taxonomy, involving specialty and regional divides and presents a challenge in developing consistent clinical guidelines. Divisions reflect varying interpretations of symptom mechanisms, origins and significance, as detailed above.

In table 4, diagnoses and other labels relevant to UCTS in the literature are presented and categorically divided according to inflammatory and functional concepts. Terms with a shared clinical or pathophysiological focus are further grouped. Current understanding of clinical features, symptom mechanisms, disease associations and other identified biopsychosocial factors for each were synthesised from the literature and are summarised in the table. Similarly, biopsychosocial associations associated with each UCTS reported in the literature are summarised in table 5.

Table 4
Clinical features reported in association with unexplained chronic throat symptoms

Table 5
Symptom associations in unexplained chronic throat symptoms

On review of the literature, three broad themes emerged in terms of diagnostic taxonomy and nomenclature:

Symptom-centric terms

Various diagnoses in the UCTS landscape identify a predominant symptom profile following the exclusion of structural pathologies (eg, idiopathic cough, functional dysphonia). This extends the symptom-directed approach that guides the assessment of organic and structural disease concepts in patients with undifferentiated throat symptoms.

Mechanism-centric terms

Diagnoses may identify a central mechanism for UCTS and likewise imply the absence of identifiable organic disease. They may relate to single symptoms (eg, CHS, muscle tension dysphonia) or encompass multiple symptom manifestations (eg, Laryngeal dysfunction).

Disease-centric terms

UCTS may be empirically attributed to consequences of underlying disease states, such as reflux or allergy (LPR, AL). These diagnoses are distinguished from those in table 2 by the inherent challenge in both identifying the proposed disease and establishing the symptom–disease correlation.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^da217d43]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^8fdec13b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) — corticosteroid therapy recommendation: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, with a recommendation against prescribing based on randomized trials showing adverse events and absence of clinical trials demonstrating benefits with a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use. Quality improvement opportunity is to discourage the empiric use of steroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal examination. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with randomized trials showing increased incidence of adverse events associated with orally administered steroids and absence of clinical trials demonstrating any benefit of steroid treatment on outcomes, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit is to avoid potential adverse events associated with unproven therapy, with risks, harms, costs noted as none, and a benefits-harms assessment indicating a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use; value judgments emphasize avoiding adverse events of ineffective or unproven therapy. Patient preferences have a small role with shared decision making in specific circumstances, exclusions include children with croup, the policy level is recommendation against, and there were no differences of opinions.

### Congenital subglottic cyst: a rare cause for sudden airway compromise in a newborn [^f1c5e764]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Assessing the response to treatment may assist in making the correct diagnosis. A good response to epinephrine and corticosteroids may be seen in inflammatory conditions, such as croup. The use of positive end expiratory pressure or CPAP may show the most improvement in dynamic obstruction, such as in tracheobronchomalacia.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of neonatal stridor and symptoms are often exacerbated during feeding, agitation or when supine. While it may be present at birth, it usually develops in the weeks to months after birth. Most cases of laryngomalacia will self-resolve; however, treatment includes managing reflux and thickened feeds for mild-to-moderate disease and surgical intervention with supraglottoplasty for severe disease. In our case, a diagnosis of laryngomalacia was less likely as the stridor was present from birth, biphasic and unchanged with position.

Vocal cord palsy is the second most common cause for neonatal stridor and may be congenital or iatrogenic. Iatrogenic causes include cardiac surgeries and tracheo-oesophageal fistula repair. Unilateral vocal cord palsy usually presents with weak cry and aspiration, but can also present with stridor. Bilateral vocal cord palsy is more likely to result in severe airway obstruction with blue spells and may require urgent tracheostomy.

Acquired subglottic cysts are often treated with endoscopic marsupialisation with cold steel instruments. CO 2 laser, coblation and a microdebrider are used cautiously to avoid creating circumferential scarring of an already narrow neonatal or infant airway. Due to the rarity of the condition, there is no consensus on the treatment of congenital subglottic cysts although the overarching goal remains the same: to establish and maintain a patient airway with resolution of symptoms, minimal residual scarring and no recurrence. In this case report, the priority was focused on urgently securing the airway and restoring airway patency. Fortunately, there was no evidence of recurrence or scarring on follow-up laryngoscopy. While the recurrence rates in congenital subglottic cysts are unknown, recurrence rates in acquired subglottic cyst may be as high as 20%.

### Breathing (and coding?) a bit easier: changes to international classification of disease coding for pulmonary hypertension [^66f72f62]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^62151678]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) background and burden — Dysphonia is characterized by altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication and/or quality of life and affects nearly one-third of the population at some point in its life.

### Congenital vocal cord paralysis [^01b2db2f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital stridor is rare. The most common presentation for congenital stridor is chronic loud breathing since birth. It is noticed in patients by the first 4 to 6 weeks of life. There are many causes of congenital stridor. Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of congenital stridor. Congenital vocal cord paralysis is the second most common cause of congenital stridor. Vocal cord paralysis in infants and children can be either congenital or acquired and either unilateral or bilateral. Although most commonly the paralysis is idiopathic, there are many causes of acquired vocal cord paralysis. Arnold-Chiari malformation is the most common congenital central nervous system abnormality resulting in vocal cord paralysis, and central nervous system abnormalities usually may cause bilateral vocal cord paralysis. In this article, we report 2 patients with idiopathic congenital vocal cord paralysis. One of them has the unilateral vocal cord paralysis, and the other, bilateral.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^b5e84f42]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to regard patients with a neck mass as at increased risk for malignancy if the mass persists ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or is of uncertain duration and there is no history of infectious etiology.

Additionally, 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented COVID-19 diagnosis before the post–COVID-19 diagnosis, although fewer children had a prior COVID-19 code (569 cases [52.7%]). The median (IQR) time between the COVID-19 and post–COVID-19 diagnosis was 56 (21–200) days, ranging from 40 days for children to 59 days for younger adults (Table). The most common concurrent conditions varied by age; children aged 0 to 17 years experienced COVID-19–like symptoms (eg, cough, 207 cases [19.2%]; and breathing abnormalities, 115 cases [10.6%]), whereas more serious conditions were more common among adults 65 years or older (eg, respiratory failure, 459 cases [21.1%]; and viral pneumonia,189 cases [8.7%]) (Figure 2 and eTable in the Supplement).

Observed Proportions of Concurrent Diagnosis Codes on the Day of Post–COVID-19 Diagnosis Code by Age

COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Signs and symptoms (eg, cough and breathing abnormalities) were slightly less common on the day of the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code compared with the 30 days before the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code. Comparatively, more serious conditions (eg, respiratory failure and viral pneumonia) were slightly more common in the 30 days before the post–COVID-19 code compared with the day of the post–COVID-19 code (Figure 3).

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.
