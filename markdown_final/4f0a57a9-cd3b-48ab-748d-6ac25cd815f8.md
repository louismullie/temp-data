## Question

What is the role of mechanical ventilation in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of mechanical ventilation in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental role of mechanical ventilation in ARDS. Then, I should verify the core principle of lung-protective ventilation and its evidence base. Next, I will examine specific ventilatory parameters and targets. After that, I need to review adjunctive strategies like PEEP, prone positioning, and neuromuscular blockade. I will then consider rescue therapies and special populations, including COVID-19. Finally, I should appraise implementation gaps, controversies, and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational role of mechanical ventilation in ARDS. Mechanical ventilation is supportive rather than curative; it maintains gas exchange while the underlying lung injury heals, but it can itself cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), so the therapeutic goal is to support life while minimizing iatrogenic harm, which is why lung-protective strategies are central to care [^cefcf7a4] [^a926812b].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle before moving on. The cornerstone of ARDS ventilation is lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and limited inspiratory pressures to reduce VILI, and this strategy has been shown to reduce mortality in randomized trials and meta-analyses, establishing it as the standard of care [^e357071e] [^cec115f0] [^6433c599].

> I need to check the specific targets next. Guidelines consistently recommend tidal volumes of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O; many clinicians target around 6 mL/kg PBW, and performance measures operationalize these thresholds for quality improvement and audit [^e357071e] [^cb26f7e8] [^9064e500].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about PEEP. I initially thought higher PEEP universally improves outcomes, but I should double-check the nuance. Meta-analyses and guidelines suggest higher PEEP benefits patients with moderate to severe ARDS (P/F ≤ 200 mmHg) by improving oxygenation and possibly reducing mortality, whereas in mild ARDS, higher PEEP may not help and could be harmful; thus, PEEP should be individualized and, when used at higher levels, paired with low tidal volume ventilation rather than aggressive recruitment maneuvers [^869428a8] [^66697e06] [^0efbd720].

> Next, I should review prone positioning because it meaningfully changes outcomes. Strong recommendations support prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day in severe ARDS, with multiple RCTs and meta-analyses showing reduced mortality; this remains one of the few non-pharmacologic interventions with consistent survival benefit in severe disease [^e357071e] [^18518d04] [^f245e39c].

> I will now examine neuromuscular blockade in early severe ARDS. Guidelines suggest early neuromuscular blockade for 48 hours in severe ARDS to improve ventilator synchrony and gas exchange, though the most recent large RCT (ROSE) did not show a mortality benefit, so this remains a conditional recommendation with low certainty and should be balanced against sedation and mobility goals [^6bd2927c] [^4fe45b28].

> Let me consider rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation does not improve survival and may be harmful in moderate to severe ARDS, so it should not be used routinely; in contrast, veno-venous ECMO is reasonable in selected patients with severe, refractory hypoxemia or hypercapnic acidosis despite optimized conventional therapy, ideally in experienced centers [^e972fef1] [^6bd2927c] [^295af2db].

> But wait, what if the ARDS is due to COVID-19? Does the ventilation strategy change? Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 ARDS shares similar respiratory mechanics with classical ARDS, so the same lung-protective principles, prone positioning, and cautious PEEP titration apply; personalized approaches may be even more important given heterogeneity, but the core strategy remains unchanged [^7636e21a] [^8068f949] [^d1f108de].

> I should confirm implementation realities because evidence-to-practice gaps persist. Despite strong recommendations, adherence to low tidal volume ventilation remains inconsistent, and underuse is associated with worse outcomes; quality improvement initiatives and performance measurement are essential to close this gap and standardize care across ICUs [^9064e500] [^3f8be4d9].

> Let me reconsider controversies so I don't overstate certainty. Some argue that a fixed 6 mL/kg PBW may be too rigid and that individualization by lung mechanics, recruitability, and effort may be preferable; observational and physiologic data support tailoring VT and focusing on driving pressure, but definitive RCTs are limited, so moderation and individualized assessment are prudent while evidence matures [^24e5b199] [^fe2baea4] [^222935bb].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise approach. First, recognize ARDS early and initiate lung-protective ventilation with 4–8 mL/kg PBW and plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O. Second, titrate PEEP to improve oxygenation while avoiding overdistension, favoring higher PEEP in moderate to severe disease. Third, implement prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day in severe ARDS. Fourth, consider early neuromuscular blockade in severe cases. Fifth, escalate to ECMO if refractory hypoxemia persists despite optimized conventional therapy. And sixth, embed daily assessment for weaning and liberation once the patient improves [^e357071e] [^6bd2927c] [^639e6077].

> In summary, mechanical ventilation in ARDS is life-sustaining supportive therapy whose primary role is to maintain adequate gas exchange while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury through lung-protective ventilation; when applied with low tidal volumes, limited plateau pressures, judicious PEEP, prone positioning in severe disease, and selective adjuncts, it reduces mortality and improves outcomes, though implementation and individualization remain critical challenges [^cefcf7a4] [^e357071e] [^da5d5d1d].

---

Mechanical ventilation is **life-sustaining support** for ARDS, not a cure [^cefcf7a4]. The primary goal is to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation while **minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)** [^a926812b] through lung-protective strategies: low tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg PBW), plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O, and appropriate PEEP [^e357071e] [^d8ad12c9]. Prone positioning is recommended for severe ARDS to improve oxygenation and reduce mortality [^e357071e] [^18518d04]. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is not recommended routinely [^e972fef1] [^ccb0a6ce]. Mechanical ventilation does not treat the underlying cause; management must also target the precipitating illness and complications [^cefcf7a4].

---

## Indications for mechanical ventilation in ARDS

Mechanical ventilation is indicated in ARDS when **hypoxemia persists despite supplemental oxygen** (typically PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg) or when **hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis** compromise hemodynamics or mental status. It is also indicated for **respiratory distress** with increased work of breathing that leads to fatigue or impending respiratory failure.

---

## Goals of mechanical ventilation in ARDS

The primary goals of mechanical ventilation in ARDS are to:

- **Maintain adequate oxygenation**: PaO2 ≥ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≥ 88% [^notfound].
- **Maintain adequate ventilation**: PaCO2 35–45 mmHg, accepting permissive hypercapnia when necessary to limit VILI [^52283d68].
- **Minimize VILI**: Avoid alveolar overdistension, cyclic collapse, and excessive shear stress [^6b93373c].
- **Support systemic function**: Reduce respiratory muscle workload and improve comfort [^13a7691d].

---

## Lung-protective ventilation strategies

Lung-protective ventilation is the cornerstone of ARDS management, aiming to **reduce VILI** and improve outcomes [^e357071e]:

| **Parameter** | **Recommended target** |
|-|-|
| Tidal volume (VT) | 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) [^e357071e] [^d8ad12c9] |
| Plateau pressure (Pplat) | ≤ 30 cm H2O [^e357071e] [^314fb091] |
| Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) | 5–12 cm H2O, individualized to minimize atelectasis and optimize oxygenation [^869428a8] [^4ad820df] |
| Driving pressure (Pplat - PEEP) | ≤ 14 cm H2O when feasible [^notfound] |
| Respiratory rate | 20–35 breaths/min to maintain adequate minute ventilation [^notfound] |

---

Permissive hypercapnia is acceptable to enable **lung-protective settings**, provided pH remains ≥ 7.20 [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and ventilatory modes

Several adjunctive therapies and modes are used to **optimize oxygenation and reduce VILI**:

- **Prone positioning**: Strongly recommended for severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 150 mmHg) to improve oxygenation and reduce mortality [^e357071e] [^18518d04].
- **Neuromuscular blockade**: Considered early in severe ARDS to improve ventilator synchrony and reduce VILI [^6bd2927c] [^4fe45b28].
- **Recruitment maneuvers**: Brief, cautious maneuvers may be considered; prolonged high-pressure maneuvers are not recommended [^66697e06] [^ed10d01d].
- **High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)**: Not recommended routinely due to lack of mortality benefit and potential harm [^e972fef1] [^ccb0a6ce].
- **Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**: Considered in refractory hypoxemia despite optimal conventional therapy [^6bd2927c] [^295af2db].

---

## Risks and complications of mechanical ventilation in ARDS

Mechanical ventilation in ARDS carries significant risks and complications, including:

- **Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)**: Barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma [^92d6960f].
- **Oxygen toxicity**: Excessive FiO2 can cause oxidative lung injury [^notfound].
- **Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)**: Increased risk with prolonged ventilation [^notfound].
- **Hemodynamic compromise**: PEEP and high intrathoracic pressures can reduce venous return and cardiac output [^notfound].
- **Long-term complications**: Chronic lung disease, neuromuscular weakness, and cognitive impairment [^cefcf7a4].

---

## Outcomes and prognosis

Mechanical ventilation, particularly with lung-protective strategies, has significantly improved outcomes in ARDS. Mortality has declined from 40–60% to 30–40% in recent decades, though it remains high in severe cases [^cefcf7a4]. Prone positioning and low tidal volume ventilation are the interventions with the most consistent mortality benefit [^89b0f99e].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from ATS/ESICM/SCCM and other societies emphasize:

- **Lung-protective ventilation**: Low tidal volumes and limited plateau pressures for all ARDS patients [^e357071e] [^d8ad12c9].
- **Prone positioning**: For severe ARDS [^e357071e] [^18518d04].
- **Individualized PEEP**: Tailored to patient-specific factors and disease severity [^869428a8] [^4ad820df].
- **Avoidance of routine HFOV**: Due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^e972fef1] [^ccb0a6ce].

---

Mechanical ventilation is **essential supportive therapy** for ARDS, with the primary goal of maintaining gas exchange while minimizing VILI through lung-protective strategies. It does not treat the underlying cause, so comprehensive management must address the precipitating illness and complications.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units across the globe. As experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimising ventilatory management. Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the current paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common condition in intensive care unit patients and remains a major concern, with mortality rates of around 30-45% and considerable long-term morbidity. Respiratory support in these patients must be optimized to ensure adequate gas exchange while minimizing the risks of ventilator-induced lung injury. The aim of this expert opinion document is to review the available clinical evidence related to ventilator support and adjuvant therapies in order to provide evidence-based and experience-based clinical recommendations for the management of patients with ARDS.

### Mechanical ventilation in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^88bc92c4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is now common in intensive care units throughout the world. The diagnosis of ARDS is based on a definition that includes bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs, impaired oxygenation, and the absence of clinical evidence of elevated left atrial pressure. ARDS is the clinical result of a group of diverse processes, which range from physical or chemical injury, to extensive activation of innate inflammatory response. All these processes damage the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier causing increased alveolar-capillary permeability and an influx of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space. This alveolar flooding results in hypoxemia, inactivated surfactant, intrapulmonary shunt, and impaired alveolar ventilation. The treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is largely supportive in nature, keeping patients alive while allowing their lungs to heal, and minimizing further pulmonary insult. In 1994 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) established the ARDS Network for the conduct of clinical trials. This is a network, supported by the National Institutes of Health, that provided the infrastructure for well-designed, multicenter, randomized trials of therapies for ARDS. The first study from this group in 2001 produced landmark data demonstrating mortality improvements in ARDS with particular mechanical ventilation strategies. Specifically, low tidal volume mechanical ventilation was demonstrated to reduce mortality by 22%. Other strategies such as high positive end expiratory pressure and prone positioning have not been shown to reduce mortality. Clinicians who are involved in the care of patients with ARDS should have a basic understanding of mechanical ventilation and the evidence guiding the mechanical ventilation strategies of these patients. Until further evidence is published, providers should adopt the use of a volume and pressure limited approach to mechanical ventilation.

Introduction

Aims

The purpose of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based framework for the management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that will inform both key decisions in the care of individual patients and broader policy. Our recommendations are neither dictates nor standards of care. We cannot take into account all of the features of individual patients and complex local factors; all we can do is to synthesise relevant evidence and to put it into the context of current critical care medicine. Similarly, our recommendations are not comprehensive: these guidelines have relevance to a fraction of the total number of decisions that are required of carers for these complex patients. Indeed, the current state of the art for the management of ARDS has been recently reviewedand comparable guidelines have been produced by national and international stakeholders.

Scope

The topics considered were chosen by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in the light of results from a survey carried out for the Intensive Care Society (ICS), including 556 responses from 3200 members. Popular topics were excluded by the GDG if it was felt that there was a dearth of evidence (eg, appropriate diagnostic investigations and the role of specialist centres), when the evidence was not specific to ARDS (weaning from mechanical ventilation, nutrition and the timing of tracheostomy) and if there was overlap with existing guidelines (post-ICU (intensive care unit) care and rehabilitation).

### Ventilatory management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a926812b]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

The acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are critical illnesses associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive therapy. However, despite several important advances, the optimal strategy for ventilation and adjunctive therapies for patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome is still evolving.

Evidence Acquisition

To identify reports of invasive ventilatory and adjunctive therapies in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we performed a systematic English-language literature search of MEDLINE (1966-2005) using the Medical Subject Heading respiratory distress syndrome, adult, and related text words, with emphasis on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were similarly searched. The search yielded 1357 potential articles of which 53 were relevant to the study objectives and considered in this review.

Evidence Synthesis

There is strong evidence to support the use of volume- and pressure-limited lung-protective ventilation in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The benefit of increased levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers is uncertain and is being further evaluated in ongoing trials. Existing randomized controlled trials of alternative ventilation modes, such as high-frequency oscillation and adjunctive therapies, including inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning demonstrate no significant survival advantage. However, they may have a role as rescue therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with refractory life-threatening hypoxemia.

Conclusions

Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation strategies should be used in managing adult acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Further research is needed to identify barriers to widespread adoption of this strategy, as well as the role of alternative ventilation modes and adjunctive therapies.

### Personalized mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^fe2baea4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

A personalized mechanical ventilation approach for patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on lung physiology and morphology, ARDS etiology, lung imaging, and biological phenotypes may improve ventilation practice and outcome. However, additional research is warranted before personalized mechanical ventilation strategies can be applied at the bedside. Ventilatory parameters should be titrated based on close monitoring of targeted physiologic variables and individualized goals. Although low tidal volume (V T ) is a standard of care, further individualization of V T may necessitate the evaluation of lung volume reserve (e.g., inspiratory capacity). Low driving pressures provide a target for clinicians to adjust V T and possibly to optimize positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), while maintaining plateau pressures below safety thresholds. Esophageal pressure monitoring allows estimation of transpulmonary pressure, but its use requires technical skill and correct physiologic interpretation for clinical application at the bedside. Mechanical power considers ventilatory parameters as a whole in the optimization of ventilation setting, but further studies are necessary to assess its clinical relevance. The identification of recruitability in patients with ARDS is essential to titrate and individualize PEEP. To define gas-exchange targets for individual patients, clinicians should consider issues related to oxygen transport and dead space. In this review, we discuss the rationale for personalized approaches to mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS, the role of lung imaging, phenotype identification, physiologically based individualized approaches to ventilation, and a future research agenda.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the use of mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel conducted systematic reviews and metaanalyses of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

Results

For all patients with ARDS, the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4-8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure<30 cm H 2 O) (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (high confidence in effect estimates) and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure (moderate confidence in effect estimates) and recruitment maneuvers (low confidence in effect estimates). Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected ventilatory interventions for adult patients with ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### Optimal ventilator settings in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^26f5b2d7]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine, acute lung injury and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome pose major therapeutic problems. While mechanical ventilation is integral to the care of these patients, its adverse consequences including ventilator-induced lung injury are determinants of disease progression and prognosis. Among several important ventilator parameters, the use of low tidal volumes is probably the most important feature of lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Intensivists should be trained to recognize acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome and encouraged to use low-tidal-volume ventilation in clinical practice. Alternative modes of ventilation such as high-frequency ventilation and prone position should be reserved for selected patients in whom conventional lung-protective ventilation strategies have failed.

### Mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^9e8c2b00]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome continues to be a high-mortality condition. The role of mechanical ventilation remains primarily a supportive modality. Recent research has elucidated the adverse impact of traditional ventilation strategies on development of the disease and, ultimately, mortality. The institution of low tidal volume ventilation has been the only intervention that has resulted in definitive improvement in survival. Animal and human investigations that culminated in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network low tidal volume study are reviewed. Current controversies in the application of mechanical ventilation including the use of positive end-expiratory pressure, recruitment maneuvers, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation are also addressed.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—conclusions emphasize individualized application of recommendations and research gaps: Significant advances have been made in the ventilatory management of ARDS in the last few decades, and clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline, and they should be careful when comparing the relative benefits of one intervention over another if they have the same rating. The potential benefits or synergies of combined or sequential treatments with interventions included in this guideline have not been explicitly studied, and therefore no recommendations have been made, while most recent studies of ventilatory interventions, however, have used LTV ventilation in recognition of supportive clinical and experimental evidence.

### An evidence-based approach to acute respiratory distress syndrome [^8a760a6b]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

We provide an evidence-based approach to managing patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We searched MEDLINE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health for randomized trials evaluating lung-protective ventilation strategies, inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and late-phase corticosteroids for managing these patients, and for additional literature related to long-term follow-up of ARDS survivors. The results of our review suggest that pressure- and volume-limited ventilation, according to the ARDS Network protocol, can reduce mortality for patients with acute lung injury, and so may an "open lung" approach to mechanical ventilation. Those 2 strategies are currently being compared in 2 multicenter randomized trials. Although both inhaled nitric oxide therapy and prone positioning can produce dramatic acute improvements in oxygenation for some patients, there is no evidence that these interventions can benefit patients with respect to patient-important outcomes. Therefore it is unreasonable to be dogmatic about the role of inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning in ARDS. The role of corticosteroids in the late phase of ARDS is unclear and remains a very important unanswered question. With respect to long-term follow-up, we found that pulmonary dysfunction is probably not a major source of morbidity for ARDS survivors, whereas neuropsychological dysfunction is prominent. Ongoing research may suggest interventions to improve the outcome of ARDS and of critical illness in general.

### Fifty years of research in ARDS. is acute respiratory distress syndrome a preventable disease? [^2f6fdf6d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in our understanding and management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the morbidity and mortality from ARDS remains high. Given the limited number of effective treatments for established ARDS, the strategic focus of ARDS research has shifted toward identifying patients with or at high risk of ARDS early in the course of the underlying illness, when strategies to reduce the development and progression of ARDS and associated organ failures can be systematically evaluated. In this review, we summarize the rationale, current evidence, and future directions in ARDS prevention.

### Clinical review: acute respiratory distress syndrome-clinical ventilator management and adjunct therapy [^4641f9f0]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a potentially devastating form of acute inflammatory lung injury with a high short-term mortality rate and significant long-term consequences among survivors. Supportive care, principally with mechanical ventilation, remains the cornerstone of therapy - although the goals of this support have changed in recent years - from maintaining normal physiological parameters to avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury while providing adequate gas exchange. In this article we discuss the current evidence base for ventilatory support and adjunctive therapies in patients with ARDS. Key components of such a strategy include avoiding lung overdistension by limiting tidal volumes and airway pressures, and the use of positive end-expiratory pressure with or without lung recruitment manoeuvres in patients with severe ARDS. Adjunctive therapies discussed include pharmacologic techniques (for example, vasodilators, diuretics, neuromuscular blockade) and nonpharmacologic techniques (for example, prone position, alternative modes of ventilation).

### Mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome during extracorporeal life support. research and practice [^fb78c8df]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-induced lung injury remains a key contributor to the morbidity and mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Efforts to minimize this injury are typically limited by the need to preserve adequate gas exchange. In the most severe forms of the syndrome, extracorporeal life support is increasingly being deployed for severe hypoxemia or hypercapnic acidosis refractory to conventional ventilator management strategies. Data from a recent randomized controlled trial, a post hoc analysis of that trial, a meta-analysis, and a large international multicenter observational study suggest that extracorporeal life support, when combined with lower Vt and airway pressures than the current standard of care, may improve outcomes compared with conventional management in patients with the most severe forms of ARDS. These findings raise important questions not only about the optimal ventilation strategies for patients receiving extracorporeal support but also regarding how various mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS may potentially be mitigated by ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategies when gas exchange is sufficiently managed with the extracorporeal circuit. Additional studies are needed to more precisely delineate the best strategies for optimizing invasive mechanical ventilation in this patient population.

LurieMD, PhD, Contributing EditorIndividualAuthor To the Editor: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is an inflammatory syndrome of the lung with a mortality rate of 35% to 65%. 1 Despite intense research into the mechanisms underlying ARDS, it is unclear why most deaths attributable to. ARDS are not from respiratory failure, but rather from progressive dysfunction of other organs, or so-called multisystem organ failure. 2 One hypothesis is that mechanical ventilation, which is invariably used in the care of patients with ARDS, can increase alveolar capillary permeability and augment the pulmonary inflammatory response, leading to increased production. of inflammatory mediators. 3 If these mediators enter the circulation, they could cause MSOF. 4 Fontanarosa PB, Ranieri VM, Giunta F, Suter PM, Slutsky AS.

### Advances in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (...) [^99291083]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

The approach to mechanical ventilation has been revolutionized by new insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Concepts such as low-volume ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, inverse ratio ventilation, best and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, airway shear, pressure volume curves, inflection points, and prone positioning have radically transformed thinking about ventilator management. Since 1966, more than 8000 ARDS-related publications have appeared. Studies highlighting the experimental basis for innovations in mechanical ventilation are presented. Selected clinical series that exemplify the use of these new strategies are reviewed, to demonstrate how key experimental and clinical research has altered our understanding about what works, and why. Mismanagement of mechanical ventilation causes lung injury and increases mortality.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^c699a406]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to 10% of patients with respiratory failure admitted through the emergency department. Use of noninvasive respiratory support has proliferated in recent years; clinicians must understand the relative merits and risks of these technologies and know how to recognize signs of failure. The cornerstone of ARDS care of the mechanically ventilated patient is low-tidal volume ventilation based on ideal body weight. Adjunctive therapies, such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may have a role in the emergency department management of ARDS depending on patient and department characteristics.

### What links ventilator driving pressure with survival in the acute respiratory distress syndrome? A computational study [^e50bab5d]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute heterogeneous inflammation of the lungs leading to deterioration in effective gas exchange, worsening of lung compliance, increasing pulmonary shunt, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Almost 1 in 10 intensive care admissions meet the ARDS criteria, 70% of which are categorized as ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ ARDS, with mortality rates exceeding 40%. The most common means of reinstating adequate oxygenation in patients with ARDS is through mechanical ventilation (MV), with the aim of meeting patients’ oxygenation and CO 2 removal requirements while the underlying pathology is treated. However, the lungs of patients suffering from ARDS are highly susceptible to damage introduced by mechanical ventilation, commonly known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Minimizing lung injury, while maintaining adequate gas exchange (“protective ventilation”), is thus a crucial requirement in the effective clinical management of ARDS. Currently, there is widespread confusion regarding how best to achieve protective ventilation in ARDS, with multiple debates ongoing regarding the problem. Many strategies have been proposed, and are in use; each with its own rationale, advocates and evidence of effectiveness. Evaluating the relative benefits of different strategies using only traditional approaches (e.g. randomized trials) is challenging and costly, due to the number of potential strategies and disease states, and to the difficulty of recruiting critically ill patients to clinical trials.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilatory management—key guideline recommendations are as follows: The recommendations for the following interventions for the treatment of ARDS are strong: mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) with lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) and prone positioning for more than 12 h/d in severe ARDS, each with stated confidence in effect estimates; the recommendation against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is strong; the recommendation for higher positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with moderate or severe ARDS and for recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is conditional, with the listed confidence ratings; and additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

### Lung protective ventilation strategy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^cec115f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury require mechanical ventilatory support. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are further complicated by ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung protective ventilation strategies may lead to improved survival. This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 2003 and updated in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ventilation with lower tidal volume on morbidity and mortality in patients aged 16 years or older affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. A secondary objective was to determine whether the comparison between low and conventional tidal volume was different if a plateau airway pressure of greater than 30 to 35 cm H20 was used.

Search Methods

In our previous 2007 updated review, we searched databases from inception until 2006. In this third updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Web of Science from 2006 to September 2012. We also updated our search of databases of ongoing research and of reference lists from 2006 to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation using either a lower tidal volume (Vt) or low airway driving pressure (plateau pressure 30 cm H2O or less), resulting in a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg or less, versus ventilation that used Vt in the range of 10 to 15 ml/kg in adults (16 years old or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Wherever appropriate, results were pooled. We applied fixed-effect and random-effects models.

Main Results

We did not find any new study which were eligible for inclusion in this update. The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 patients. Five trials had a low risk of bias. One trial had an unclear risk of bias. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced with a RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92). Overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O in the control group was used (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). There was insufficient evidence for morbidity and long-term outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinical heterogeneity, such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials, makes the interpretation of the combined results difficult. Mortality was significantly reduced at day 28 and at the end of the hospital stay. The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded. Ventilation with lower tidal volumes is becoming a routine strategy of treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury, stopping investigators from carrying out additional trials.

### Lower tidal volume at initiation of mechanical ventilation may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^9d0ea810]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

• The majority of data suggest that higher tidal volumes are causal in the development of ARDS.

• An overall lack of quality data prevents a definitive recommendation for the most appropriate tidal volume in patients with ARDS.

• ARDS occurs early in the course of mechanical ventilation, suggesting that ARDS-prevention trials should occur early in the course of mechanical ventilation, such as in the emergency department.

• The development of ARDS is associated with significant increases in mortality and morbidity, suggesting that ARDS-prevention trials are needed.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine guideline—mechanical ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—states that the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O); for patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d; and for patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### Mechanical ventilation strategies for intensive care unit patients without acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^99dc45a5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It has been shown that the application of lung-protective mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume can improve the prognosis of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Several clinical studies have attempted to optimize the ventilator management strategy to improve oxygenation and lung compliance, thereby reducing the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and the mortality of ICU patients without ALI or ARDS. However, the optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for ICU patients without ALI or ARDS is uncertain.

Clinical data show that patients without a diagnosis of ALI or ARDS can benefit ventilation with a low tidal volume. Schultz et al. concluded that the initial ventilator setting, high tidal volume, may be associated with lung injury in patients without ALI or ARDS. Serpa Neto et al. used a traditional pairwise meta-analysis to systematically evaluate ventilation strategies such as high and low tidal volume. Their conclusions were as follows: compared to ventilation with a higher tidal volume, protective ventilation with lower tidal volumes at the onset of mechanical ventilation was associated with better clinical outcomes, including a shorter length of hospital stay, lower mortality, fewer pulmonary infections, and less atelectasis, among patients without ALI or ARDS.

In addition to tidal volume, there are other factors in the overall ventilation strategy, such as positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), recruitment maneuver (RM), and respiratory ratio. Tidal volume and PEEP play important roles. However, traditional pairwise meta-analysis can only be used to compare specific factors between ventilation strategies and cannot be used to compare the entire set of parameters relevant to different ventilation strategies. Therefore, tidal volume and clinical outcomes of different comprehensive ventilation strategies using a specific tidal volume and PEEP cannot be compared by traditional pairwise meta-analysis. Accordingly, the results obtained from traditional pairwise meta-analyses have significant limitations. Fortunately, a network meta-analysis is advantageous for the evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of multiple interventions, even when some parameters might not have been directly compared. Additionally, network meta-analysis has the potential to reduce the uncertainty in treatment effect estimates. Given these advantages, we used a network meta-analysis to search the literature for data examining the optimal tidal volume and PEEP in patients without ALI or ARDS. Based on these data, we divided the ventilation mode into six types and considered each ventilation mode as a unique ventilation strategy. Subsequently, the effectiveness and safety of various ventilation strategies were compared to identify the optimal ventilation strategy for ICU patients without ALI or ARDS.

### Lower tidal volume at initiation of mechanical ventilation may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^776d9cdd]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The most appropriate tidal volume in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is controversial and has not been rigorously examined. Our objective was to determine whether a mechanical ventilation strategy using lower tidal volume is associated with a decreased incidence of progression to ARDS when compared with a higher tidal volume strategy.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, conference proceedings, and clinical trial registration was performed with a comprehensive strategy. Studies providing information on mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation, and in which tidal volume was independently studied as a predictor variable for outcome, were included. The primary outcome was progression to ARDS.

Results

The search yielded 1,704 studies, of which 13 were included in the final analysis. One randomized controlled trial was found; the remaining 12 studies were observational. The patient cohorts were significantly heterogeneous in composition and baseline risk for developing ARDS; therefore, a meta-analysis of the data was not performed. The majority of the studies (n = 8) showed a decrease in progression to ARDS with a lower tidal volume strategy. ARDS developed early in the course of illness (5 hours to 3.7 days). The development of ARDS was associated with increased mortality, lengths of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, and nonpulmonary organ failure.

Conclusions

In mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS at the time of endotracheal intubation, the majority of data favors lower tidal volume to reduce progression to ARDS. However, due to significant heterogeneity in the data, no definitive recommendations can be made. Further randomized controlled trials examining the role of lower tidal volumes in patients without ARDS, controlling for ARDS risk, are needed.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: a historical perspective [^3ad069f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Though well described even in ancient writings, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) gained major medical attention with the availability of mechanical ventilation and establishment of intensive care units. In the 50 years since this beginning there have been remarkable advances in the understanding of the etiology, physiology, histology, and epidemiology of this often lethal complication of common human maladies. Until recently, improvements in outcome have mainly followed improvements in intensive care unit operation and their associated life support systems, and have not come through discoveries made in the course of prospective randomized trials. In spite of the remarkable increase in research focused on ARDS, there remain a large number of unanswered clinical questions that are potentially extremely important with regard to short-term morbidity as well as long-term outcome. The ARDS Clinical Trials Network study of tidal volume has proven that randomized trials in ARDS with positive results are possible even when using difficult primary outcome measures such as mortality or ventilator-free days. Therefore, the rich combination of new trial strategies, potential treatments, experienced investigators, and increasingly standardized routine care set the stage for rapid advances to be made in the short- and long-term outcomes of this devastating syndrome.

### Lower tidal volume at initiation of mechanical ventilation may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^fdd67c5e]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently, no definitive recommendations can be made on the most appropriate tidal volume strategy in mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS. Data suggest an increased incidence of ARDS with higher tidal volumes, but previous studies are limited by their heterogeneity and high variability in baseline ARDS risk among the patients included. Given the increased mortality and morbidity associated with progression to ARDS, a focus on prevention should remain a high priority for future research and clinical practice.

### Mechanical ventilation [^42a6624a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation has advanced significantly over the last 20 years. The goal of therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome should be to optimize oxygenation while minimizing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury and providing adequate ventilation. Appropriate use of ventilation modes and strategies, positive-end expiratory pressure levels, and recruitment maneuvers can improve oxygen delivery. Salvage therapies, such as prone positioning, inhaled epoprostenol and nitric oxide, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, have a well-established role in supportive management and are associated with improved oxygenation but not survival.

### Ventilatory management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (...) [^bbd58c18]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

No specific pharmacologic therapy has proved effective for ALI or ARDS, and therapy is largely supportive with the use of mechanical ventilation. 11 Perhaps the most important advance in ALI and ARDS research has been the recognition that mechanical ventilation, although necessary to preserve life, can potentiate or directly injure the lungs through. Conventional lung-protective ventilation involves strategies designed to mitigate further lung injury in patients with ALI or ARDS using a standard mechanical ventilator. Five randomized controlled trials23-27 and 3 meta-analyses28-30 have evaluated lung-protective ventilation compared with conventional approaches, using a variety of volume- and pressure-limited strategies. Quiz Ref IDThe largest trial of volume- and pressure-limited ventilation was conducted by the ARDS Network. 27 This trial of 861 patients demonstrated a 9% absolute decrease in mortality when patients with ALI or ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation have reduced tidal volumes and reduced pressures. In addition to pressure and volume limitation, higher PEEP and the use of recruitment maneuvers may be important components of a lung-protective ventilation strategy. A second trial of 61 ARDS patients comparing HFOV with conventional mechanical ventilation also revealed no significant differences in survival without supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support, or other secondary end points. 50 However, a post hoc analysis revealed that patients with the most severe hypoxemia had a trend toward a benefit from HFOV.

Recognition that mechanical ventilation, although life-saving, can contribute to patient morbidity and mortality has been the most important advance in the management of patients with ALI and ARDS. Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation clearly leads to improved patient survival. The role of recruitment maneuvers, higher levels of PEEP, or both remain controversial and are the subject of 2 ongoing multicenter clinical trials.

### Lung protective ventilation strategy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^2f7c71ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury require mechanical ventilatory support. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are further complicated by ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung-protective ventilation strategies may lead to improved survival.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ventilation with lower tidal volume on morbidity and mortality in patients aged 16 years or older affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. A secondary objective was to determine whether the comparison between low and conventional tidal volume was different if a plateau airway pressure of greater than 30 to 35 cm H20 was used.

Search Strategy

In our original review, we searched databases from inception until 2003. In this updated review, we searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). We updated our search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Web of Science from 2003 to 2006. We also updated our search of intensive care journals and conference proceedings; databases of ongoing research, reference lists and 'grey literature' from 2003 to 2006.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation using either lower tidal volume (Vt) or low airway driving pressure (plateau pressure 30 cm H2O or less), resulting in tidal volume of 7 ml/kg or less versus ventilation that uses Vt in the range of 10 to 15 ml/kg, in adults (16 years old or older).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Wherever appropriate, results were pooled. We applied fixed- and random-effects models.

Main Results

We found one new study in this update for a total of six trials, involving 1297 patients, which were eligible for inclusion. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation: relative risk (RR) 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced: RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92); overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O in control group was used: RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). There was insufficient evidence about morbidity and long term outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinical heterogeneity, such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials, make the interpretation of the combined results difficult. Mortality is significantly reduced at day 28 and at the end of hospital stay. The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded.

### Science review: mechanisms of ventilator-induced injury [^92d6960f]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury are among the most frequent reasons for intensive care unit admission, accounting for approximately one-third of admissions. Mortality from ARDS has been estimated as high as 70% in some studies. Until recently, however, no targeted therapy had been found to improve patient outcome, including mortality. With the completion of the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network low tidal volume study, clinicians now have convincing evidence that ventilation with tidal volumes lower than those conventionally used in this patient population reduces the relative risk of mortality by 21%. These data confirm the long-held suspicion that the role of mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is more than supportive, in that mechanical ventilation can also actively contribute to lung injury. The mechanisms of the protective effects of low tidal volume ventilation in conjunction with positive end expiratory pressure are incompletely understood and are the focus of ongoing studies. The objective of the present article is to review the potential cellular mechanisms of lung injury attributable to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS and acute lung injury.

### Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a clinical review [^961fe692]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are well defined and readily recognised clinical disorders caused by many clinical insults to the lung or because of predispositions to lung injury. That this process is common in intensive care is well established. The mainstay of treatment for this disorder is provision of excellent supportive care since these patients are critically ill and frequently have coexisting conditions including sepsis and multiple organ failure. Refinements in ventilator and fluid management supported by data from prospective randomised trials have increased the methods available to effectively manage this disorder.

### Toward optimal mechanical ventilation of the injured lung: the role of expiratory duration [^8d0a2895]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 40% of the 200,000 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the US each year do not survive. Public awareness of the devastation wrought by ARDS has significantly increased since 2020 because of its role in the morbidity and mortality of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Currently there are no preventive medical therapies for ARDS, so management remains purely supportive. Central to this support is positive pressure mechanical ventilation, but this potentially life-saving intervention is a double-edged sword that can also increase fatality when it leads to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Accordingly, recent efforts have been made to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation in favor of other techniques such as high-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive ventilation methods such as continuous or biphasic positive airway pressure.

When mechanical ventilation is necessary, however, the only base of evidence for its use in ARDS is low-tidal volume (low-V T) ventilation, and prone positioning. There is also some evidence that avoidance of high driving pressure is also beneficial, although this has yet to be proven definitively. Unfortunately, mortality from ARDS has remained essentially stable since the ARDSnet trial. Even the case for some level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) remains equivocal despite its physiologic rationale being beyond dispute. No trial has yet demonstrated a reduction in mortality by any algorithm for selecting PEEP, although some meta-analyses suggest otherwise.

These various factors nurture the conviction that we have yet to find the best way to mechanically ventilate patients with ARDS. Identifying an optimal strategy has proven challenging because of the plethora of pathophysiologic considerations pertinent to VILI. In this Perspective, we systematically explore these considerations to identify potential research directions that may help to optimize mechanical ventilation in a patient-specific manner.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^03fd5f2f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four “PICO questions” (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

American Thoracic Society workshop—low tidal volume ventilation performance measure for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is anchored to the 2017 guideline recommendation stating, “We recommend that adult patients with ARDS receive mechanical ventilation with strategies that limit tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg PBW [predicted body weight]) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cm H2O) (strong recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates).” The indicator targets the “Proportion of ventilator settings from the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients with a diagnosis of ARDS that meet criteria as low tidal volume ventilation.” The numerator is the “Number of ventilator settings in the denominator that meet tidal volume (4–8 mL/kg PBW) AND peak or inspiratory pause (plateau) pressure (<30 cm H2O) criteria,” and the denominator is the “Number of low tidal volume ventilation opportunities as defined by: Twice daily ventilator setting measures over the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a diagnosis ARDS,” with data sources specified. Exclusions include “Pre-existing chronic fibrotic lung disease” and “Death within 12 hours of intubation,” and subsequent exclusions of “Initiation of ECMO,” “Plan to withdraw life-sustaining treatment,” “Initiation of ventilator weaning,” and “Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.” The page also notes that the American Thoracic Society “recommends that only ‘strong’ recommendations should be considered for performance measure development.”

Management

The essence of management of ARDS consists of optimising the diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions, and the deployment of supportive measures that minimise iatrogenic injury and the consequences of severe critical illness (ie, secondary and tertiary prevention). We have combined these strategies with the outcome of the analysis of evidence relating to the topics selected in figure 3.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^cefcf7a4]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients and is defined by the acute onset of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, hypoxaemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. ARDS occurs most often in the setting of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents or severe trauma and is present in ~10% of all patients in intensive care units worldwide. Despite some improvements, mortality remains high at 30-40% in most studies. Pathological specimens from patients with ARDS frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory oedematous fluid in the alveolar space. Diagnosis is based on consensus syndromic criteria, with modifications for under-resourced settings and in paediatric patients. Treatment focuses on lung-protective ventilation; no specific pharmacotherapies have been identified. Long-term outcomes of patients with ARDS are increasingly recognized as important research targets, as many patients survive ARDS only to have ongoing functional and/or psychological sequelae. Future directions include efforts to facilitate earlier recognition of ARDS, identifying responsive subsets of patients and ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of lung injury to design specific treatments.

### Mechanical ventilation-associated lung fibrosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a significant contributor to poor outcome [^d3c0b0fd]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

One of the most challenging problems in critical care medicine is the management of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Increasing evidence from experimental and clinical studies suggests that mechanical ventilation, which is necessary for life support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, can cause lung fibrosis, which may significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. The role of mechanical stress as an inciting factor for lung fibrosis versus its role in lung homeostasis and the restoration of normal pulmonary parenchymal architecture is poorly understood. In this review, the authors explore recent advances in the field of pulmonary fibrosis in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome, concentrating on its relevance to the practice of mechanical ventilation, as commonly applied by anesthetists and intensivists. The authors focus the discussion on the thesis that mechanical ventilation-or more specifically, that ventilator-induced lung injury-may be a major contributor to lung fibrosis. The authors critically appraise possible mechanisms underlying the mechanical stress-induced lung fibrosis and highlight potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate this fibrosis.

Discussion

The summary of the group’s recommendations emphasises the importance of avoiding VALI in patients with ARDS, as all of the interventions with positive recommendations apart from maintaining a conservative fluid balance, arguably act through this process. Despite at best moderate quality evidence by MA, we have strongly supported the use of low tidal volume and low airway pressure mechanical ventilation. This ventilation strategy is supported by results of the ARDS Network ARMA study,data from studies whose primary outcome was the prevention of ARDS and a large volume of evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies. It is now so universally accepted that it is mandated for all patients in clinical trials of ARDS. When applied to patients with moderate/severe ARDS for at least 12 hours per day, prone positioning was also strongly recommended because the most recent studies focused enrolment on the most severe strata of patients with ARDS and involved a multimodal intervention comprising lung-protective ventilation with prolonged prone positioning producing highly favourable outcomes.By contrast, despite a strong theoretical rationale as a means of preventing VALI, high frequency oscillatory ventilation was ineffective or deleterious in two large studies leading to our recommendation strongly against its use.

While broadly similar recommendations for the management of ARDS have been produced, many questions remain. Fundamentally the parameters characterising optimal protective mechanical ventilation are unknown, as are the optimal means of achieving them. We have recommended targeting < 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW), but, based on the absence of evidence of a safe tidal volume threshold on retrospective reanalysis of the ARMA studyand a dose-response effect seen in observational studies,it would be reasonable to recommend minimising tidal volume as far as possible. Similarly, analysing individual patient data from RCT concluded that driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) was a better predictor of outcome than tidal volume or plateau pressure alone.Finally, there is no consensus regarding the means used to optimise PEEP (oxygenation or various lung mechanical parameters) or to manage the respiratory acidosis that commonly accompanies protective ventilation.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^b5b5b3a0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Current management of ARDS is hampered by failure to diagnose the condition and to prevent iatrogenic harms. We need to heighten awareness of the diagnosis, particularly outside ICU, so that the opportunity to prevent progression of the syndrome is not missed. Research into prevention and treatment needs to be translated more effectively into the clinic. Biomarkers that confirmed the diagnosis highlighted patients with a poor prognosis and predicted that a positive response to a particular therapy would be invaluable in research and clinical care. For example, a validated bedside biomarker of VALI would facilitate the fine tuning of mechanical ventilation and could guide related decisions during the recovery phase of ARDS, for example, assessing the risk-benefit relationship between allowing spontaneous ventilatory modes with associated larger tidal volumes.

In order to discover effective drug therapies, continued investment in human studies that aim to elucidate the pathogenesis of ARDS is essential to identify clinically useful biomarkers and surrogate outcome measures.These investigations need to be performed with a view to designing a stepwise approach to testing novel therapeutics in this particularly challenging patient group.

Finally, standardisation of outcome measures will help in the conduct and comparison of clinical trials and such work is underway, for example, the Core Outcomes for Ventilation Trials: the COVenT Delphi study (COMET registration:). As reflected in the outcome prioritisation exercise carried out by the GDG, there is an increasing emphasis on the health of survivors of critical illness, which mandates that clinical trials include long-term outcomes and economic analysis that will inform the societal impact of intensive care medicine.

### Mechanical ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a review of new strategies for the practicing hospitalist [^639e6077]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of mechanical ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is to support adequate gas exchange without harming the lungs. How patients are mechanically ventilated can significantly impact their ultimate outcomes.

Methods

This review focuses on emerging evidence regarding strategies for mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure including: low tidal volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), novel ventilator modes as alternatives to low tidal volume ventilation, adjunctive strategies that may enhance recovery in ARDS, the use of lung-protective strategies in patients without ARDS, rescue therapies in refractory hypoxemia, and an evidence-based approach to weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Results

Once a patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, low tidal volume ventilation remains the best strategy in ARDS. Adjunctive therapies in ARDS include a conservative fluid management strategy, as well as neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning in moderate-to-severe disease. There is also emerging evidence that a lung-protective strategy may benefit non-ARDS patients. For patients with refractory hypoxemia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered. Once the patient demonstrates signs of recovery, the best approach to liberation from mechanical ventilation involves daily spontaneous breathing trials and protocolized assessment of readiness for extubation.

Conclusions

Prompt recognition of ARDS and use of lung-protective ventilation, as well as evidence-based adjunctive therapies, remain the cornerstones of caring for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to consider lung-protective ventilation in non-ARDS patients as well, though the evidence supporting this practice is less conclusive.

### Early treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^52283d68]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury invoked by a variety of systemic or pulmonary insults. Despite medical progress in management, mortality remains 27% to 45%. Patients with ARDS should be managed with low tidal volume ventilation. Permissive hypercapnea is well tolerated. Conservative fluid strategy can reduce ventilator and hospital days in patients without shock. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers reduce mortality in some patients. Early management of ARDS is relevant to emergency medicine. Identifying ARDS patients who should be transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center is an important task for emergency providers.

### Management of the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a8c6cdc8]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Significant advances have occurred in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is now recognized that ARDS is a manifestation of a diffuse process that results from a complicated cascade of events following an initial insult or injury. Mechanical ventilation and PEEP are still important components of supportive therapy. To avoid ventilator-associated lung injury there is emphasis on targeting ventilator management based on measurement of pulmonary mechanics. For those with resistant hypoxia and severe pulmonary hypertension adjunctive modalities, such as prone positioning and low-dose iNO, may provide important benefit. Alternative modes of supporting gas exchange, such as with partial liquid ventilation and extracorporeal gas-exchange, may serve as rescue therapies. Advances in cell and molecular biology have contributed to a better understanding of the role of inflammatory cells and mediators that contribute to the acute lung injury and the pathophysiology of the syndrome that manifests as ARDS. Based on this new understanding, the potential targets for intervention to ameliorate the systemic inflammatory response have proliferated. Examples include the cytokine network and its receptors, antioxidants, and endothelins. Apart from the challenge of testing these agents in experimental models, it seems likely that determination of the optimum combination of agents will become an equally important endeavor. A particular challenge is to develop better methods of predicting which of the many at-risk patients will go on to full-blown ARDS and MODS, thereby targeting subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies. Similarly, the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy may be diminished by improved, perhaps molecular, techniques to detect microbial pathogens and permit differentiation between Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis.

American Thoracic Society acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) guideline—conclusions provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. With regard to differences from ESICM guidance, the document states “we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients” and clarifies that the recommendation is narrower “with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers)”; for neuromuscular blocking agents, it notes “we suggest its use in early severe ARDS.” For performance measurement, the committee determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable; measures retained from 2017 specify ventilation strategies limiting tidal volume to 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cm H2O) in ARDS, and prone positioning for >12 hours per day in severe ARDS.

### Management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a primer [^a9168400]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

This narrative review explores the physiology and evidence-based management of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia, with a focus on mechanical ventilation, adjunctive therapies, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Severe ARDS cases increased dramatically worldwide during the Covid-19 pandemic and carry a high mortality. The mainstay of treatment to improve survival and ventilator-free days is proning, conservative fluid management, and lung protective ventilation. Ventilator settings should be individualized when possible to improve patient-ventilator synchrony and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Positive end-expiratory pressure can be individualized by titrating to best respiratory system compliance, or by using advanced methods, such as electrical impedance tomography or esophageal manometry. Adjustments to mitigate high driving pressure and mechanical power, two possible drivers of VILI, may be further beneficial. In patients with refractory hypoxemia, salvage modes of ventilation such as high frequency oscillatory ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation are additional options that may be appropriate in select patients. Adjunctive therapies also may be applied judiciously, such as recruitment maneuvers, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, neuromuscular blockers, or glucocorticoids, and may improve oxygenation, but do not clearly reduce mortality. In select, refractory cases, the addition of V-V ECMO improves gas exchange and modestly improves survival by allowing for lung rest. In addition to VILI, patients with severe ARDS are at risk for complications including acute cor pulmonale, physical debility, and neurocognitive deficits. Even among the most severe cases, ARDS is a heterogeneous disease, and future studies are needed to identify ARDS subgroups to individualize therapies and advance care.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^66697e06]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilatory strategy—higher versus lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with or without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs)—we suggest using higher PEEP without LRMs rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ≥ 35 cm H2O for ≥ 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Compared with lower PEEP, higher PEEP without LRMs probably reduced mortality (n = 4 trials, 1,162 patients; RR, 0.77; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.60–0.96), improved oxygenation (MD PaO2/FiO2 ratio 63.7 mm Hg higher; 95% CrI, 51.5–75.9 mm Hg), and possibly increased ventilator-free days (MD, 1.3 more; 95% CI, 2.5 fewer to 4.3 more), while the impact on barotrauma was uncertain (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87–1.86). Compared with higher PEEP without LRMs, higher PEEP with prolonged LRMs probably increased mortality (RR, 1.37; 95% CrI, 1.04–1.81), whereas brief LRMs or esophageal pressure–guided PEEP titration may have no effect on mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CrI, 0.79–1.48; and RR, 1.00; 95% CrI, 0.65–1.54). An individual patient meta-analysis including 2,299 patients reported higher PEEP probably improved survival in moderate to severe ARDS (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00; P = 0.049) but possibly increased mortality in mild ARDS (adjusted RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.91–1.83; P = 0.02). For patients with mild ARDS, there were insufficient data to make a recommendation on PEEP strategy, and there was a lack of consensus on brief LRMs and using esophageal pressures to set PEEP.

Considerable progress has been made recently in the understanding of how best to accomplish safe and effective ventilation of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical and nonmechanical factors contribute to causation of ventilator-associated lung injury. Intervention timing helps determine the therapeutic efficacy and outcome, and the stage and severity of the disease process may determine the patient's vulnerability as well as an intervention's value. Reducing oxygen consumption and ventilatory demands are key to a successful strategy for respiratory support of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Results from major clinical trials can be understood against the background of the complex physiology of ventilator-induced lung injury.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal condition whereby the lung is injured by direct (eg, pneumonia or aspiration) or indirect (eg, extrapulmonary sepsis) insults. Clinically, patients with ARDS develop severe hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, and most die of sepsis or multiorgan failure rather than from refractory respiratory failure. Acute respiratory distress is an important public health problem. A global epidemiologic studyreported that 10.4% of total intensive care unit admissions and 23.4% of all patients who were intubated had ARDS, with an associated hospital mortality of 40%.

Since the first description of ARDS in 1967,a number of approaches to its management have been evaluated and used clinically. Despite more than 50 years of research, to our knowledge, none of the treatments currently available are aimed directly at the pathophysiological mechanism resulting in acute respiratory failure (ie, increased alveolar capillary permeability); current approaches are mainly supportive. Perhaps most important has been the recognition that although mechanical ventilation is critical for the survival of patients with ARDS, it can also be injurious (ie, ventilator-induced lung injury).Indeed, lung protective ventilation (LPV), using low tidal volumes and airway pressures to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, is considered the mainstay of management in patients with ARDS.

In 2017, clinical practice guidelines on mechanical ventilation in adult patients with ARDS were published for 6 individual interventions, as follows: (1) LPV, (2) higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), (3) lung recruitment maneuvers (RMs), (4) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), (5) prone positioning, and (6) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO).However, for clinicians, choosing between potentially efficacious treatments can be challenging if the treatments have not been directly compared in clinical trials (eg, prone positioning vs VV ECMO). Moreover, 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)—the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART),the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial,the Esophageal Pressure-Guided Ventilation 2 (EPVent2) trial,and the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial—have been published since the guidelines were completed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare different therapeutic strategies simultaneously to identify the best strategy associated with a reduction in mortality and to rank those therapeutic modalities for adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Lung-protective ventilation strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a critical reappraisal of current practice [^24e5b199]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Recognition of ventilator-induced lung injury has led to the development of lung-protective ventilation strategies, significantly influencing the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). By the end of the 20th century, five randomized controlled trials had compared the survival benefits of low tidal volume (VT) ventilation with those of traditional high VT ventilation. Two studies demonstrated favourable outcomes, most notably the landmark ARDS Network trial, which established the widely recommended VT of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight. However, the universal application of a fixed VT has been controversial, with poor adherence in clinical practice. The two trials used a greater contrast in VTs (6 vs. 12 mL/kg) than did the others (7–11 mL/kg) and incorporated methodological extremes, including toleration of elevated airway pressures or encouragement of unnecessary increases. In addition, disparities in underlying aetiologies and ventilatory parameters, such as unbalanced positive end-expiratory pressure and respiratory rates, may have influenced the results. There is no conclusive evidence to support the superiority of 6 mL/kg over intermediate VTs (7–10 mL/kg). Many subsequent studies have suggested that VT requirements should be individualized on the basis of lung mechanics and physiological status. The benefits of the current recommendations may be limited by factors such as the severity of hypoxemia, lung compliance, dead-space fraction, and inaccuracies in formula-based lung volume estimation. The goal of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients is supportive rather than curative; therefore, a moderate approach is recommended in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to establish an individualized, patient-centred approach that allows more flexible and moderate settings.

### Association of breathing effort with survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^be576b31]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question : Does the proportion of time spent in high respiratory effort during the active breathing phase correlate with ICU survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients on invasive mechanical ventilation? This study analyzed continuous, high-density data collected over 7 days to characterize the evolution of respiratory effort and its association with patient outcomes.

Findings : In this prospective cohort study analyzing over 1.4 million respiratory cycles in 26 ARDS patients, nonsurvivors spent significantly more time in high respiratory effort (12% vs. 3%; p = 0.006) and had higher exposure to elevated dynamic transpulmonary driving pressures (> 25 cm H 2 O) compared with survivors. Survivors exhibited more time in the moderate-effort range (50% vs. 5%; p < 0.001).

Meaning : In ARDS patients, prolonged exposure to high respiratory effort is associated with increased mortality, underscoring the critical role of optimizing respiratory effort to potentially improve clinical outcomes.

The management of acute distress respiratory syndrome (ARDS) often includes invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) as a life-sustaining therapy (–). Despite advancements in IMV management, mortality for ARDS patients requiring IMV remains high, ranging from 30% to 50% (,–). At the initial phase, mechanical ventilation is delivered without active respiratory muscle activity (passive mechanical ventilation) due to sedation and, sometimes, neuromuscular blockade. The initiation of spontaneous breathing is a critical step toward liberation from mechanical ventilation and offers several advantages compared with passive mechanical ventilation (–). However, the patient’s respiratory effort during IMV can also be associated with several mechanism of harm. Excessive respiratory effort has been hypothesized to cause patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) (,–) by significantly increasing the total pressure applied to the lungs. Excessive diaphragmatic contractions may lead to load-induced diaphragmatic injury (myotrauma) (–). Recent observational studies have linked these effects to longer durations of IMV, increased morbidity, and higher mortality. Nevertheless, much of the existing data on respiratory effort during IMV has been gathered over short periods of time (–) (e.g. 5 min every day during 5 consecutive d). These short-term assessments may not accurately reflect the patient’s respiratory effort over the entire course of mechanical ventilation. Consequently, there is a risk of underestimating the burden of sustained high respiratory effort and its potential harms.

### Approaches to conventional mechanical ventilation of the patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^6b93373c]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

To minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, attention should be directed toward avoidance of alveolar over-distention and cyclical opening and closure of alveoli. The most impressive study of mechanical ventilation to date is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network study  of higher versus lower tidal volume (V(T)), which reported a reduction in mortality from 39.8% to 31.0% with 6 mL/kg ideal body weight rather than 12 mL/kg ideal body weight (number-needed-to-treat of 12 patients). To achieve optimal lung protection, the lowest plateau pressure and  V(T) possible should be selected. What is most important is limitation of V(T) and alveolar distending pressure, regardless of the mode set on the ventilator. Accumulating observational evidence suggests that V(T) should be limited in all mechanically ventilated  patients-even those who do not have ALI/ARDS. Evidence does not support the use of pressure controlled inverse-ratio ventilation. Although zero PEEP is probably injurious, an area of considerable controversy is the optimal setting of PEEP. Available evidence does not support the use  of higher PEEP, compared to lower PEEP, in unselected patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, results of a meta-analysis using individual patients from 3 randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in  patients with ALI. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding over-distention. Many approaches for setting PEEP have been described, but evidence is lacking that any one approach is superior to any other. In most, if not all, cases of ALI/ARDS, conventional ventilation  strategies can be used effectively to provide lung-protective ventilation strategies.

Uncertainties and research priorities

The optimal strategy for setting PEEP in patients with ARDS remains uncertain. None of the included RCTs incorporated assessments of lung “recruitability” in response to higher PEEP strategies. Validating strategies to assess for lung recruitability at the bedside, such as the use of oxygenation response, driving pressure change, recruitment/inflation ratio, stress index, or electrical impedance tomography, may help guide individualized PEEP titration. A large multicenter trial evaluating setting PEEP based on respiratory mechanics (recruitability and effort) is ongoing (CAVI-ARDS [Careful Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome] trial;ID, NCT03963622). There is an essential need for further studies to evaluate the effect of PEEP strategies in specific populations (e.g. obese patients) and specific ARDS phenotypes (e.g. hyper-/hypoinflammatory) and with concomitant interventions (e.g. proning). There is likely no uniform best PEEP strategy for all patients with ARDS, and these future research efforts may help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from each PEEP strategy.

### Lower tidal volume at initiation of mechanical ventilation may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^b0420a87]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Close to 200,000 cases of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur annually in the United States. It remains a leading cause of death in critically ill patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%, but as high as 60% in the elderly. ARDS also represents a large societal burden, accounting for 3.6 million hospital days annually and significant long-term sequelae in survivors. These include various neuropsychological impairments (e.g. depression, cognitive decline), persistent weakness and pulmonary dysfunction, and decreased quality of life.Unfortunately, the number of ARDS trials demonstrating improved clinical outcomes are far outnumbered by those that have not [-]. In patients with ARDS, the current body of evidence supports a lower tidal volume strategy as best practice.

In contrast, the optimal tidal volume in patients without ARDS is uncertain. Historically, it was thought that high tidal volume not only was safe, but also was preferred to avoid the hypoxia, atelectasis, and acidosis associated with mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes [-]. This led to the common use of tidal volumes in the 12- to 15-ml/kg range. However, experimental data suggest that tidal volume is a major contributor to the development of lung injury. Clinical data in intensive care unit (ICU) patients also suggests that larger tidal volume may contribute to the development of ARDS [-], suggesting that this syndrome may in part be preventable. However, this evidence has been inconclusive, because of observational trial design, small sample sizes, and lack of reproducibility in different patient populations. In patients without lung injury at the time of endotracheal intubation, progression to ARDS can occur over the course of hours and may increase mortality by >30%. This has led to increased interest in ARDS prevention and the examination of a lower tidal volume strategy to prevent its development in patients without lung injury.

We therefore aimed to systematically review the evidence regarding the role of tidal volume as a contributor to ARDS progression in patients without ARDS. The objectives of this study were to perform a systematic review of the literature comprising a comprehensive search strategy and standardized analysis techniques to determine whether lower tidal volumes, compared with higher tidal volumes, are associated with a decreased incidence of ARDS in mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesized that lower tidal volume ventilation is associated with a decrease in progression to ARDS in mechanically ventilated patients, but the existing literature lacks the methodologic quality to provide definitive recommendations for the best tidal volume in patients without ARDS.

### Advances in the support of respiratory failure: putting all the evidence together [^a8bbe5c2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent years physicians have learned to care better for their patients with acute respiratory failure. For no condition has this improvement become more evident than in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a signature problem of intensive care. Over time, we have learned important lessons. We know from research and experience that despite well-intentioned attempts at revision, our clinical definition for ARDS still needs work. We are now also aware that many factors--mechanical and nonmechanical--contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Timing has proven key to the efficacy of several important ventilation-related therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the stage and severity of disease determine an intervention's potential value or harm. A collective implication of the growing evidence base related to respiratory failure is that reducing oxygen consumption and ventilator demands is a rational point of focus and high priority when attempting to optimize respiratory support for the individual patient.

### Current and evolving standards of care for patients with ARDS [^480d2678]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has changed considerably over the 50 years since its original description. Indeed, standards of care continue to evolve as does how this clinical entity is defined and how patients are grouped and treated in clinical practice. In this narrative review we discuss current standards - treatments that have a solid evidence base and are well established as targets for usual care - and also evolving standards - treatments that have promise and may become widely adopted in the future. We focus on three broad domains of ventilatory management, ventilation adjuncts, and pharmacotherapy. Current standards for ventilatory management include limitation of tidal volume and airway pressure and standard approaches to setting PEEP, while evolving standards might focus on limitation of driving pressure or mechanical power, individual titration of PEEP, and monitoring efforts during spontaneous breathing. Current standards in ventilation adjuncts include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal life support after prone positioning in patients with severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate. Pharmacotherapy current standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock; evolving standards may include steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19, or specific biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS. While much progress has been made, certainly significant work remains to be done and we look forward to these future developments.

### Lower tidal volume at initiation of mechanical ventilation may reduce progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^13ee2a44]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Fourth, the development of ARDS was associated with many other factors across these trials. These include patient-related (e.g. restrictive lung disease), ventilator-related (e.g. airway pressure), and non ventilator-related (e.g. fluid balance and transfusion) factors. This further highlights that the development of ARDS reflects an interaction between patient risk and treatment variables, which was demonstrated before, and suggests that the most effective ARDS-prevention strategy may involve a multimodal approach (e.g. early resuscitation, fluid management and type, lower tidal volume, high transfusion threshold, and so on). In addition, future ARDS-prevention trials will need to control for each of these confounding variables while assessing patient populations with similar baseline risk of progressing to ARDS.

Finally, the progression to ARDS is associated with significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In all trials directly comparing ARDS versus no-ARDS groups, mortality (up to fivefold increase), length of stay, and organ failure were all increased with the development of the syndrome. Although the best strategy to prevent the progression to ARDS has not been fully elucidated, it is clear that its prevention should be a high priority in clinical care and further research.

Important limitations exist in this systematic review. The only RCT was stopped early, after an unplanned interim analysis, because of safety concerns of ARDS development in the 10-ml/kg PBW group. Clinical trials stopped early for benefit are increasing in prevalence, often lack information on why the trial was stopped, and routinely show larger than expected treatment effects. The benefit of clinical trials stopped early, including the trial in this review, should therefore be viewed with caution. However, with 75% of the planned enrollment achieved, and a very significant between-group difference for the primary outcome (p = 0.01), confidence is increased that these results are indeed valid.

Second, relatively few studies have examined ARDS prevention and the role of tidal volume in the development of ARDS. Existing studies are limited by their observational trial design, and therefore any attempt to analyze these studies as a group is limited by their individual weaknesses.

### Effects of interventions on survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome: an umbrella review of 159 published randomized trials and 29 meta-analyses [^89b0f99e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple interventions have been tested in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We examined the entire agenda of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in ARDS that reported on mortality and of respective meta-analyses.

Methods

We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge until July 2013. We included RCTs in ARDS published in English. We excluded trials of newborns and children; and those on short-term interventions, ARDS prevention, or post-traumatic lung injury. We also reviewed all meta-analyses of RCTs in this field that addressed mortality. Treatment modalities were grouped in five categories: mechanical ventilation strategies and respiratory care, enteral or parenteral therapies, inhaled/intratracheal medications, nutritional support, and hemodynamic monitoring.

Results

We identified 159 published RCTs of which 93 had overall mortality reported (n = 20,671 patients)--44 trials (14,426 patients) reported mortality as a primary outcome. A statistically significant survival benefit was observed in eight trials (seven interventions) and two trials reported an adverse effect on survival. Among RCTs with more than 50 deaths in at least one treatment arm (n = 21), two showed a statistically significant mortality benefit of the intervention (lower tidal volumes and prone positioning), one showed a statistically significant mortality benefit only in adjusted analyses (cisatracurium), and one (high-frequency oscillatory ventilation) showed a significant detrimental effect. Across 29 meta-analyses, the most consistent evidence was seen for low tidal volumes and prone positioning in severe ARDS.

Conclusions

There is limited supportive evidence that specific interventions can decrease mortality in ARDS. While low tidal volumes and prone positioning in severe ARDS seem effective, most sporadic findings of interventions suggesting reduced mortality are not corroborated consistently in large-scale evidence including meta-analyses.

### Personalized medicine for ARDS: the 2035 research agenda [^44080fe7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the last 20 years, survival among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has increased substantially with advances in lung-protective ventilation and resuscitation. Building on this success, personalizing mechanical ventilation to patient-specific physiology for enhanced lung protection will be a top research priority for the years ahead. However, the ARDS research agenda must be broader in scope. Further understanding of the heterogeneous biology, from molecular to mechanical, underlying early ARDS pathogenesis is essential to inform therapeutic discovery and tailor treatment and prevention strategies to the individual patient. The ARDSne(x)t research agenda for the next 20 years calls for bringing personalized medicine to ARDS, asking simultaneously both whether a treatment affords clinically meaningful benefit and for whom. This expanded scope necessitates standard acquisition of highly granular biological, physiological, and clinical data across studies to identify biologically distinct subgroups that may respond differently to a given intervention. Clinical trials will need to consider enrichment strategies and incorporate long-term functional outcomes. Tremendous investment in research infrastructure and global collaboration will be vital to fulfilling this agenda.

### Management (...) [^13a7691d]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Numerous previous trials of new pharmacologic and ventilatory modalities have failed to demonstrate improvement in mortality rates. However, recent trials using a new “lung protective” approach to mechanical ventilation resulted in significant reductions in mortality rates. 2, 3 Data from these studies represent an encouraging breakthrough in the management of ARDS. Many family physicians care for patients with ARDS, and many patients who survive ARDS receive their post-intensive care unit treatment from family physicians. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of this syndrome is essential. 2/Fio 2 ratio. Generally, a marked reduction in lung compliance occurs, which increases the work of breathing. The physiologic dead space increases in ARDS and, to maintain a normal or near-normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, patients must increase their minute ventilation.

The severe hypoxia, increased dead space, and decreased lung compliance all contribute to the development of respiratory failure. Most patients evolve diffuse alveolar infiltrates and progress to respiratory failure within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Computed tomographic scans of the chest have led to increased understanding of the structural abnormalities occurring at different stages of ARDS. In most patients with ARDS, sedation is necessary to facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen demand. Occasionally, neuromuscular blocking agents are required to provide effective ventilation but, given the short- and long-term effects of these agents, their use should be limited, and the depth of paralysis should be carefully monitored. VENTILATORY SUPPORT The general principles of ventilatory management are outlined in Table 3. In the past, many clinicians delivered relatively large tidal volumes and hesitated to use PEEP in patients with ARDS.

However, an increased understanding of ventilator-associated lung injury and the results of recent studies have cast doubt on that strategy. In the animal model, overdistention causes acute lung injury and may exacerbate preexisting acute lung injury. Results from a recent, large, multicenter randomized trial have shown that, compared with a traditional approach to mechanical ventilation, a strategy aimed at delivering lower tidal volumes and limiting plateau pressure resulted in a 22 percent reduction in mortality 2. A smaller study combining low tidal volume ventilation with high PEEP also showed decreased mortality. 3 The use of higher levels of PEEP presumably prevents the end-tidal collapse of alveolar units, which in turn reduces repetitive opening and closing and stress-induced damage to alveoli.

### High-frequency oscillatory ventilation versus conventional ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^e972fef1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

High-frequency oscillation (HFO) is an alternative to conventional mechanical ventilation that is sometimes used to treat people with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but effects on oxygenation, mortality and adverse clinical outcomes are uncertain. This review was originally published in 2004 and was updated in 2013 and again in 2015.

Objectives

To determine the effects of HFO compared to conventional mechanical ventilation on physiological outcomes, clinical outcomes, and mortality when used for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and ISI, from inception to December 2015. We conducted the original search in 2002. We manually searched reference lists from included studies and review articles; searched conference proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (1994 to 2015), Society of Critical Care Medicine (1994 to 2015), European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (1994 to 2015), and American College of Chest Physicians (1994 to 2015); contacted clinical experts in the field; and searched for unpublished and ongoing trials in clinicaltrials.gov and controlled-trials.com.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment using HFO with conventional mechanical ventilation for children and adults diagnosed with ARDS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data on clinical, physiological, and safety outcomes according to a predefined protocol. We contacted investigators of all included studies to clarify methods and obtain additional data. We used random-effects models in the analyses.

Main Results

We include 10 RCTs (n = 1850); almost all participants had moderate or severe ARDS. For the primary analysis, the risk of bias was low in three studies and unclear in five studies; the overall quality of evidence was very low due to imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and methodologic limitations. In participants randomized to HFO, there was no significant difference in hospital or 30-day mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.16; P = 0.46, I² = 66%; 8 trials, 1779 participants, 807 deaths) compared with conventional ventilation. One large multicentre RCT was terminated early because of increased mortality in participants randomized to HFO compared to mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and high positive end expiratory pressure, with HFO reserved only as a rescue therapy. We found substantial between-trial statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 66%) for clinical outcomes, including mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this systematic review suggest that HFO does not reduce hospital and 30-day mortality due to ARDS; the quality of evidence was very low. Our findings do not support the use of HFO as a first-line strategy in people undergoing mechanical ventilation for ARDS.

### Lung-protective ventilation strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a critical reappraisal of current practice [^3c3924e3]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lung protection strategies, including low-VT ventilation in ARDS patients, represent among the most significant advancements in critical care medicine. However, there is no definitive evidence to support the superiority of a fixed VT of 6 mL/kg PBW or lower over intermediate VTs. Both excessively high and overly low VTs may be harmful in patients with ARDS, particularly in the context of severe hypoxia, markedly reduced pulmonary compliance, or a high dead-space fraction. To ensure safe and effective MV, existing protocols should be critically re-evaluated in light of emerging evidence. A therapeutic approach grounded in moderation, individualized assessment, and clinical prudence is essential for the optimal management of ARDS.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^0efbd720]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Grade recommendations

We suggest the use of high PEEP strategies for patients with moderate or severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 27 kPa: GRADE Recommendation: weakly in favour).

Grade justification

We identified low-quality evidence to support the use of higher PEEP strategies in the ventilation of patients with moderate or severe ARDS. Evidence was downgraded because of inconsistency caused by differences between individual studies in the strategy to set the level of PEEP, while some trials compared lower tidal volume ventilation as part of a ventilator strategy that incorporated higher PEEP levels. The recommendation to consider the use of higher PEEP in patients with at least moderate ARDS is based on subgroup and individual patient data MA, providing less robust evidence than a RCT investigating higher PEEP in this patient group. The risk of barotrauma as a result of the use of higher PEEP for patients with at least moderate or severe ARDS cannot be excluded because this risk has not been quantified in this population. The quality of this evidence is also limited by inconsistency as the MA included trials of high PEEP with different tidal volume strategies.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^869428a8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in adult ARDS—higher versus lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was tested in eight RCTs including 2,728 patients; on Day 1, mean ± SD PEEP was 15.1 ± 3.6 versus 9.1 ± 2.7 cm H2O. Overall mortality showed no significant difference (six studies, 2,580 patients; RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80–1.03), while oxygenation improved with higher PEEP (61 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 46–77 mm Hg). An individual patient data meta-analysis found that in moderate or severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200) higher PEEP had lower mortality (adjusted RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00), with no significant effect in mild ARDS (adjusted RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.91–1.83; P = 0.02 for comparison). We suggest that adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS receive higher rather than lower levels of PEEP (conditional recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates). This recommendation is based primarily on evidence supporting a statistically significant reduction in mortality in moderate or severe ARDS, and clinicians should consider risks when plateau pressure is greater than or equal to 30 cm H2O.

### Meta-analysis: ventilation strategies and outcomes of the acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury [^6433c599]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Trials have provided conflicting results regarding the effect of different ventilatory strategies on the outcomes of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury.

Purpose

To determine whether ventilation with low tidal volume (Vt) and limited airway pressure or higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves outcomes for patients with ARDS or acute lung injury.

Data Sources

Multiple computerized databases (through March 2009), reference lists of identified articles, and queries of principal investigators. No language restrictions were applied.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) reporting mortality and comparing lower versus higher Vt ventilation, lower versus higher PEEP, or a combination of both in adults with ARDS or acute lung injury.

Data Extraction

Using a standard protocol, 2 reviewer teams assessed trial eligibility and abstracted data on quality of study design and conduct, population characteristics, intervention, co-interventions, and confounding variables.

Data Synthesis

4 RCTs tested lower versus higher Vt ventilation at similar PEEP in 1149 patients, 3 RCTs compared lower versus higher PEEP at low Vt ventilation in 2299 patients, and 2 RCTs compared a combination of higher Vt and lower PEEP ventilation versus lower Vt and higher PEEP ventilation in 148 patients. Lower Vt ventilation reduced hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.96]; P = 0.02) compared with higher Vt ventilation at similar PEEP. Higher PEEP did not reduce hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.86 [CI, 0.72 to 1.02]; P = 0.08) compared with lower PEEP using low Vt ventilation. Higher PEEP reduced the need for rescue therapy to prevent life-threatening hypoxemia (odds ratio, 0.51 [CI, 0.36 to 0.71]; P < 0.001) and death (odds ratio, 0.51 [CI, 0.36 to 0.71]; P < 0.001) in patients receiving rescue therapies.

Limitations

Pooling according to similar ventilatory strategies resulted in few RCTs analyzed in each group. The benefit of low Vt is derived from only 1 study.

Conclusion

Available evidence from a limited number of RCTs shows better outcomes with routine use of low Vt but not high PEEP ventilation in unselected patients with ARDS or acute lung injury. High PEEP may help to prevent life-threatening hypoxemia in selected patients.

### Performance measure development, use, and measurement of effectiveness using the guideline on mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^94d8a52a]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Rationale for recommendation selection—low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was selected for performance measure (PM) development because higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), recruitment maneuvers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were eliminated on the basis of not being strong recommendations, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was rejected as the recommendation was against its use and it is rarely used even for severe ARDS, and LTVV applies to all patients with ARDS whereas prone positioning applies only to severe ARDS defined as PaO2/FiO2 less than 150 mm Hg; moreover, there is evidence that LTVV applied to patients without ARDS may have a beneficial or at least neutral effect, and the PM should follow the clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendation as closely as possible while only deviating to improve feasibility.
