## Question

Are there circumstances where thyroid extract would be preferred to levothyroxine for treating hypothyroidism, for instance in cases of gastrointestinal malabsorption?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any circumstances where desiccated thyroid extract should be preferred over levothyroxine for treating hypothyroidism, including cases of gastrointestinal malabsorption, and if so, which ones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about current guidelines and the standard of care. Then, I should verify comparative evidence between DTE and LT4. Next, I will review how malabsorption is managed, including alternative LT4 formulations and diagnostic workflows. After that, I need to examine pharmacokinetic reasons why DTE might or might not address malabsorption. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and note any narrow exceptions unrelated to malabsorption where DTE sometimes enters discussion.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care so I don't jump to conclusions. The 2025 European Thyroid Association guidance is explicit that LT4 monotherapy is the reference treatment for hypothyroidism, emphasizing dose titration to normalize TSH, brand consistency to avoid variability, and discouraging use of DTE, which is not recommended in routine care; nothing in these guidelines elevates DTE for any malabsorption scenario, which already sets a high bar for exceptions [^115F3e9c] [^111cpkBq] [^111wnznq].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness evidence so I don't misattribute benefits. Wait, let me verify the randomized data: blinded trials comparing DTE with LT4 show no improvement in quality of life or neurocognition, with small signals like modest weight loss and a slight increase in heart rate on DTE, while overall evidence quality ranges from moderate to very low; broader randomized work comparing LT4, LT4+LT3, and DTE also finds no consistent superiority of DTE, although patient preference can favor T3-containing regimens in subsets, especially the most symptomatic, which may reflect expectancy or pharmacodynamic differences without clear clinical outcome gains [^116XnAZC] [^111ErPw1] [^112sbEmW] [^11422K6m] [^112EGe2D].

> Now, I need to check what guidelines say specifically for impaired gastrointestinal absorption. The ETA explicitly recommends switching to liquid solution or soft-gel LT4 as first-line in patients with impaired absorption, enteral feeding, or infancy; these formulations mitigate pH- and dissolution-dependent variability and have clinical data showing better biochemical control in settings like PPI use and broader malabsorption, whereas DTE is not proposed as a solution for malabsorption in these documents or associated management reviews [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7] [^112twjrb] [^112qaJAX] [^112GMb8Q] [^114xYyPJ] [^112MpcZD].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale, but hold on — I should verify absorption fundamentals before inferring. LT4 absorption is variable (about 40–80%), occurs mainly in jejunum/ileum, and is reduced by malabsorption syndromes, foods, and drugs; liquid LT4 can reduce dependence on gastric dissolution, which partly explains its advantage in malabsorptive states and with acid-suppressive therapy, while DTE contains both T4 and T3 with T3 being absorbed more completely (~95%) but still does not circumvent impaired T4 uptake that remains central to replacement needs; initially I thought "malabsorption affects T4 specifically, so adding more T3 via DTE could solve it", but wait, I should correct that: the clinical target remains stable, physiologic T4 repletion with normal TSH, and giving fixed-ratio T3 via DTE adds exposure variability and chronically supraphysiologic T3 peaks without addressing the underlying T4 malabsorption, which is why guidelines favor optimized LT4 formulations rather than substituting with DTE [^117R9sTb] [^1127TFcy] [^113NRFE1] [^115F3e9c].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic and management pathway for suspected malabsorption so I don't miss reversible causes. Let me first confirm: standardized LT4 absorption testing helps distinguish true malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption, after which clinicians eliminate drug–food interferences, treat underlying GI disorders, switch to liquid or soft-gel LT4, and in severe cases consider parenteral LT4; none of these algorithmic steps introduce DTE as a recommended option for malabsorption, which is consistent across guideline and review pathways [^117PZQwr] [^116vMBwp] [^113TfG7K] [^112GMb8Q] [^117JeHAH].

> But wait, what about the oft-cited exceptions where DTE is discussed — do any intersect with malabsorption? I need to ensure I separate indications. Persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH on LT4 can prompt carefully monitored trials of LT4+LT3 in select patients, and some reports note patient preference for T3-containing regimens or hypothesized relevance of DIO2 polymorphisms; however, these scenarios are about symptom persistence rather than malabsorption, and expert consensus documents still do not elevate DTE above evidence-based combination therapy trials, underscoring that DTE is not a solution for the absorption problem per se [^112DtQc5] [^114PQwXT] [^114JbMTU] [^1166tj45].

> Let me synthesize and double-check for internal consistency before concluding. For gastrointestinal malabsorption specifically, there are no circumstances in contemporary guideline frameworks where DTE is preferred to LT4; the recommended approach is to confirm absorption status, remove interferences, treat the GI condition, and use liquid or soft-gel LT4, reserving intravenous LT4 for rare, severe cases; DTE neither addresses the core T4 absorption deficit nor demonstrates superiority in blinded trials, and it introduces variable T3 exposure and small increases in heart rate without clear clinical benefit, which is why it is not endorsed for malabsorption management [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7] [^117PZQwr] [^112GMb8Q] [^111ErPw1] [^112sbEmW].

> In practical terms, I should confirm: if LT4 tablet dosing exceeds expected requirements or TSH remains elevated, I would rule out pseudomalabsorption with an absorption test, review and separate interacting agents and meals, switch to liquid or soft-gel LT4, manage underlying GI disease, and consider parenteral LT4 if necessary; at no point would I switch to DTE to solve malabsorption, since it does not correct the pharmacokinetic barrier and is not guideline-supported for this use [^117PZQwr] [^112twjrb] [^112qaJAX] [^112GMb8Q] [^115F3e9c].

No, thyroid extract is **not preferable** to levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, even in gastrointestinal malabsorption. Levothyroxine **liquid or softgel formulations** are recommended as first-line therapy for malabsorption due to superior absorption and bioavailability versus tablets [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7]. If oral levothyroxine remains ineffective, **parenteral levothyroxine** is the next step [^112GMb8Q]. Thyroid extract is not recommended because of its **variable potency and T3 content**, which can lead to unstable thyroid levels and adverse effects [^111ErPw1]. Consider thyroid extract only when levothyroxine is unavailable or contraindicated, with close monitoring.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and absorption considerations

Levothyroxine is absorbed in the **small intestine**, with bioavailability influenced by gastric pH, food, and medications [^117R9sTb]. Malabsorption syndromes, bariatric surgery, and interfering substances can reduce absorption and cause refractory hypothyroidism [^113iHrDB] [^112fTtaR]. Thyroid extract contains both **T4 and T3**, with T3 absorbed rapidly, which may cause fluctuations in thyroid levels [^113NRFE1]. Its variable T3 content can further lead to unstable thyroid hormone levels and adverse effects.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Clinical trials and meta-analyses show **no consistent superiority** of thyroid extract over levothyroxine in symptom control, quality of life, or biochemical outcomes [^111ErPw1] [^112sbEmW]. Thyroid extract may cause higher TSH, lower T4, and higher T3 levels, reflecting its distinct pharmacokinetic profile [^113hkmQ8]. Current European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines recommend **levothyroxine as the standard therapy** for hypothyroidism, including in gastrointestinal malabsorption, and specifically endorse liquid and softgel formulations for patients with impaired gastrointestinal absorption [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7].

---

## Alternative levothyroxine formulations for malabsorption

Liquid and softgel formulations of levothyroxine have **improved bioavailability** and are less affected by gastrointestinal conditions, food, and medications than traditional tablets [^112twjrb] [^113iHrDB]. These formulations are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with malabsorption syndromes, after bariatric surgery, or with other gastrointestinal conditions that impair levothyroxine absorption [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7]. Intravenous or intramuscular **levothyroxine** is recommended for severe malabsorption or when oral therapy is ineffective [^113iHrDB]. These routes bypass gastrointestinal absorption, thereby promoting more stable thyroid hormone levels.

---

## Risks and limitations of thyroid extract

Thyroid extract carries **several limitations and risks**:

- **Variable potency**: Inconsistent T3 and T4 content leads to unstable thyroid levels [^111ErPw1].
- **Adverse effects**: Higher risk of hyperthyroid symptoms, cardiovascular effects, and bone loss due to T3 fluctuations [^111ErPw1].
- **Lack of standardization**: Not recommended by major guidelines due to inconsistent clinical outcomes and safety concerns [^111ErPw1].

---

## Clinical scenarios where thyroid extract might be considered

Thyroid extract may be considered in **rare situations**:

- **Patient preference**: Patients who strongly prefer thyroid extract and have documented improvement in symptoms, with careful monitoring.
- **Levothyroxine intolerance**: Patients with documented intolerance or allergic reactions to levothyroxine, after attempting alternative formulations.
- **Resource-limited settings**: When levothyroxine is unavailable or prohibitively expensive, thyroid extract may be used with close monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

In patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption, **the following strategies are recommended**:

- **Levothyroxine absorption test**: To differentiate true malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption or nonadherence [^117PZQwr].
- **Alternative formulations**: Use liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulations to improve absorption [^115F3e9c] [^117PpUR7].
- **Parenteral therapy**: Intravenous or intramuscular levothyroxine for severe malabsorption [^113iHrDB].
- **Regular monitoring**: Frequent TSH and free T4 measurements to adjust dosing and ensure euthyroidism.

---

Thyroid extract is generally not preferable to levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, even in gastrointestinal malabsorption. Levothyroxine remains the **standard therapy**, and liquid or softgel formulations are recommended for malabsorption. Thyroid extract may be considered only in rare cases of levothyroxine intolerance or patient preference, with careful monitoring.

### Potential risks and benefits of desiccated thyroid extract for the treatment of hypothyroidism: A systematic review [^111ErPw1]. Thyroid (2024). Low credibility.

Desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) is no longer recommended for the treatment of hypothyroidism but is still in use. This review aimed to summarize the available literature on treatment with DTE in adult patients with hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: The search was conducted up until January 6, 2024, in six electronic databases. Two reviewers independently screened all the search results. The retrieved studies compared DTE treatment with levothyroxine or combination therapy with liothyronine and levothyroxine. The primary outcome was quality of life (QoL), and the secondary outcomes included symptoms, treatment preference, adverse effects, thyroid hormone levels, thyroid autoantibodies, cardiovascular measures, and gene polymorphisms in deiodinase enzymes.

- **Results**: In the qualitative synthesis, we included nine nonrandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs), two randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and three case reports. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low for the various outcomes. The RCTs found no difference between treatments regarding QoL and symptom score assessments. In the NRSIs, symptom and QoL assessments were in favor of DTE. The included studies indicated that DTE may cause an increase in heart rate, lower body weight, and lower high-density lipoprotein compared with other treatment regimens, but results were conflicting. Most studies of DTE treatment are hampered by an inferior design, and data on long-term effects and side effects are lacking. Two RCTs could not demonstrate any difference in QoL or symptom scores when comparing different treatments.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^113iHrDB]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Liquid formulations have many advantages over solid formulations. First, liquid solutions can be used to treat patients who have difficulty swallowing, such as pediatric patients. Liquid solutions can be administered with milk for infants with congenital hypothyroidism without obvious food interference. Notably, the dose may be reduced, since liquid LT4 at an equivalent dose can lead to increased TSH suppression. In addition, a liquid LT4 formulation can be administered directly through feeding tubes in patients receiving enteral feeding, and thus are preferred by nurses due to their convenience. The oral administration of a solution via a feeding tube is also a preferred option for patients with myxedema coma when IV LT4 is unavailable.

Second and most importantly, liquid LT4 ameliorates the impaired intestinal absorption of LT4 induced by drug or food interference and gastrointestinal diseases. As mentioned above, calcium and iron supplements are common concomitant drugs and can reduce the absorption of LT4 tablets through direct complexation. In 2017, Benvenga et al. conducted a prospective, pre–post study of 19 hypothyroid patients with malabsorption due to the coingestion of calcium and iron supplements. A follow-up of at least 16 weeks showed a significantly reduced TSH level in the solution group compared with the tablet group (7.48 ± 5.8 vs 1.95 ± 1.3 mU/L, P < .001). Two years later, a retrospective study conducted by the same researchers in 50 patients revealed a similar result. PPIs could impair the absorption of LT4 tablets by elevating gastric pH. Vita et al. conducted further evaluations.

### The use of levothyroxine absorption tests in clinical practice [^117PZQwr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although levothyroxine (LT4) is a widely prescribed drug, more than 30% of LT4-treated patients fail to achieve the recommended serum level of thyrotropin with a body weight-based dose of LT4. An LT4 absorption test (LT4AT) is part of the workup for confirming normal LT4 absorption or diagnosing malabsorption. We searched PubMed with the terms: levothyrox*, L-T4, LT4, TT4, FT4, FT3, TT3, test, loading, uptake, absorp*, "absorb*, bioavailab*, bioequiv* malabsorb*, and pseudomalabsorb*. A total of 43 full-text publications were analyzed.

The published procedures for LT4AT differ markedly in the test dose, formulation, test duration, frequency of blood collection, analyte (total thyroxine [TT4] or free thyroxine [FT4]), metric (absolute or relative peak or increment, or area under the curve), and the threshold for normal absorption.

In a standardized LT4AT for routine use, the physician could advise the patient to refrain from consuming food, beverages, or medications the morning of the test; administer 1000 µg of LT4 in the patient's usual formulation as the test dose; ensure that the patient is supervised throughout the LT4AT; perform a 4-hour test with hourly blood samples; assay FT4; and consider that normal LT4 absorption corresponds to an FT4 increment of more than 0.40 ng/dL (5.14 pmol/L) or a TT4 increment of more than 6 μg/dL (77.23 nmol/L) for a test dose of at least 300 µg, or a percentage TT4 absorption of more than 60%.

If the test indicates abnormal LT4 absorption, the physician can increase the LT4 dose, change the formulation or administration route, and/or refer the patient for further evaluation.

### Synthroid [^117R9sTb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

- **Absorption**: Absorption of orally administered T4 from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the Synthroid dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. The relative bioavailability of Synthroid tablets, compared to an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 93%. T4 absorption is increased by fasting and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as soybeans. Dietary fiber decreases the bioavailability of T4. Absorption may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T4 absorption [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Distribution**: Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Elimination**:

	**Metabolism**: T4 is slowly eliminated. The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulates.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^116Gw5Mm]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Recent studies have suggested that the effect of food on LT4 could be minimized by replacing tablets with an oral solution. When administered as an oral solution, LT4 is absorbed more quickly than in tablet form and is less affected by gastric pH and other factors affecting its gastrointestinal absorption. The LT4 solution was compared with LT4 tablets in patients and it appeared to be more effective in lowering TSH levels in malabsorption and nonmalabsorption patients alike.

In another study, hypothyroid patients were asked if it was difficult to take LT4 tablets minimally 30 minutes before breakfast or coffee. Most patients found it challenging and preferred the possibility of taking the LT4 solution with breakfast.

As it can be difficult for patients to strictly respect the conditions surrounding coadministration of LT4 and food, this study investigated whether a novel LT4 liquid formulation could be administered as early as 15 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie meal versus the recommended minimum wait of 30 minutes. The 15-minute time interval was selected as the midpoint between the currently recommended minimum interval of 30 minutes for this particular LT4 formulation and concomitant meal administration, allowing for at least partial gastric emptying after LT4 administration and before food intake.

In our assessment, it was considered a reasonable improvement to a patient's tight morning routine, with the intention of improving patient adherence, although data on subject preferences regarding the timing of administration of the preparation were not collected.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113TfG7K]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, specifically in assessing treatment adherence, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend exploring low adherence to treatment or pseudomalabsorption. This should be considered when the dose of levothyroxine required to restore serum TSH within the reference interval exceeds 1.5–1.7 mcg/kg/day in adult hypothyroid patients with thyroid in situ or 1.8–2.0 mcg/kg/day in a thyroidectomized patient.

### New formulations of levothyroxine in the treatment of hypothyroidism: Trick or treat [^1131185T]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) as a medication is used by up to 5.3% of the adult population. For optimal efficacy, the traditional tablet formulation (LT4tab) requires that patients avoid concomitant ingestion with food, drinks, and certain medications, as well as excellent patient compliance. Some comorbidities influence the bioavailability of LT4 and may mandate repeated dose adjustments.

Summary: New LT4 formulations (soft gel [LT4soft] and liquid [LT4liq]) containing predissolved LT4 are claimed to improve bioavailability, presumably by facilitating absorption. Thus, these formulations may well be more suitable than LT4tab for patients whose daily requirements are subjected to variations in bioavailability. Here, we review the evidence and indications for use of new LT4 formulations and highlight areas of uncertainty that are worthy of further investigation. While bioequivalence is established for LT4soft and LT4liq administered to healthy volunteers compared with LT4tab in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, therapeutic equivalence of the new formulations seems to be different in several clinical settings.

Some evidence suggests that new formulations of LT4 may mitigate against the strict requirements relating to concomitant ingestion with food, drinks, and certain medications, which apply to traditional LT4 tablets. The principal indication is in selected patients with disease fluctuations and intermittent therapies with interfering medications, where the need for frequent dose adjustments and office visits may be diminished.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^114xYyPJ]. Thyroid (2022). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) sodium is a standard treatment for hypothyroidism. Its absorption and bioavailability when taken as a tablet have been shown to be significantly decreased with concomitant food ingestion. Therefore, LT4 formulations are recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast, potentially affecting adherence to therapy. A novel LT4 solution (Tirosint®-SOL) has been shown to result in a faster absorption process than tablets or soft-gel capsule formulations. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the bioavailability of this preparation taken 15 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie meal in comparison with the minimally recommended 30-minute interval.

- **Methods**: Thirty-six (33 completers, 24 males, and 9 females) healthy volunteers participated in the randomized study. They took 600 mcg of LT4 oral solution, single doses following a 10-hour fast, 15 or 30 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie, FDA-approved standardized meal in a controlled research setting. Serum total thyroxine was measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and multiple time points up to 72 hours after LT4 administration. The predefined equivalence boundaries for the extent of exposure, reflected by the area under the curve (AUC), were 80–125%. The washout period was at least 35 days.

- **Results**: The geometric mean ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for the baseline-adjusted extent of exposure, represented by AUCs truncated at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing, were as follows: AUC 0–48: 90% [90% CI 86–94]; and AUC 0–72.

### The levothyroxine absorption test: A four-year experience (2015–2018) at the Mayo Clinic [^117HpsZ7]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the mainstay of therapy for hypothyroidism. Yet, despite physician efforts at dose titration, some patients remain hypothyroid on LT4 doses in excess of weight-based calculations, a condition known as refractory hypothyroidism. The LT4 absorption test (LT4AT) has been proposed to have utility in these patients by enabling distinction of LT4 malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption, a condition of intentional nonadherence. Given its rare use in clinical practice, we reviewed our institution's experience with the LT4AT to assess its impact on management of refractory hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the charts of 16 patients diagnosed with refractory hypothyroidism who had completed the LT4AT between January 2015 and January 2019. The primary aim was to determine the utility of this test in distinguishing LT4 malabsorption from pseudomalabsorption. Secondary aims were to determine whether the results of this test impacted physicians' management decisions, as well as to report on clinical outcomes at follow-up. Our LT4AT is a six-hour test wherein patients receive a weight-based dose of LT4 followed by serial measurements of total thyroxine (TT4) and thyrotropin (TSH). Percentage absorption is calculated using the following formula, with normal absorption being ≥ 60%.

- **Results**: Percentage absorption was calculated in 13 of 16 patients due to lack of TT4 data for 3 patients. Absorption was impaired in one patient (% absorbed = 0), who had known causes of malabsorption. The remaining 12 patients had normal absorption by hour six.

### Armour thyroid [^113NRFE1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Armour Thyroid (thyroid tablets, USP) is a desiccated thyroid extract for oral use, derived from porcine thyroid glands. T3 liothyronine is approximately four times as potent as T4 levothyroxine on a microgram-for-microgram basis. Each grain of thyroid provides 38 mcg of levothyroxine (T4) and 9 mcg of liothyronine (T3). The inactive ingredients include calcium stearate, dextrose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and opadry white. Armour Thyroid may exhibit a strong, characteristic odor due to its thyroid extract component.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^116aZJ4Z]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The tablet form is the predominant preparation of LT4, accounting for more than 95% of LT4 prescriptions. Generally, a dose of LT4 between 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight is sufficient for the normalization of thyroid function. Unfortunately, more than 30% to 50% of LT4-treated patients are estimated to be either undertreated or overtreated. Impaired bioavailability of LT4 is a common cause of off-target serum TH levels and has been reported in patients with many medical conditions. These include concurrent diseases, co-ingestion with drugs or food, a switch in the LT4 preparation, improper storage, or poor compliance. Patients present with elevated TSH levels and reduced T3 and T4 levels, thus requiring a dose adjustment to more than 1.9 µg/kg. Identifying the underlying cause is necessary to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms.

### Does combination T4 and T3 therapy make sense [^114JbMTU]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate the existing evidence regarding the combined use of levothyroxine and liothyronine to treat hypothyroidism, eleven published randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of this combined therapy were reviewed and summarized. Related basic and clinical research findings were also incorporated for perspective.

- **Methods**: An initial randomized controlled trial reported symptomatic improvement in hypothyroid patients taking combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy compared with those taking levothyroxine therapy alone. However, multiple, relatively small randomized controlled trials subsequently failed to demonstrate any subjective or objective benefit from the combined therapy.

- **Polymorphism**: A polymorphism (Thr92Ala) in the gene encoding the deiodinase 2 (D2) enzyme, which converts thyroxine to triiodothyronine in the brain, was later identified in about 16% of hypothyroid persons. This polymorphism may impair brain deiodinase activity in the presence of low brain thyroxine levels. One randomized controlled trial found that patients with the D2 Thr92Ala polymorphism had more baseline symptoms than those with the wild-type D2 and experienced significantly greater symptomatic improvement in response to combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy.

Most hypothyroid patients experience rapid symptomatic relief after the institution of levothyroxine replacement therapy, but persistent symptoms remain in some despite what appears to be adequate levothyroxine therapy.

### Desiccated thyroid extract compared with levothyroxine in the treatment of hypothyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^116XnAZC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Patients previously treated with desiccated thyroid extract (DTE), when switched to levothyroxine (L-T₄), occasionally did not feel as well despite adequate dosing based on serum TSH levels. Our objective was to investigate the effectiveness of DTE compared with L-T₄ in hypothyroid patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover study at a tertiary care center.

Patients (n = 70, age 18–65 years) diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and on a stable dose of L-T₄ for 6 months were included in the study. Patients were randomized to either DTE or L-T₄ for 16 weeks and then crossed over for the same duration. Biochemical and neurocognitive tests at baseline and at the end of each treatment period were evaluated.

There were no differences in symptoms and neurocognitive measurements between the two therapies. Patients lost 3 lb on DTE treatment (172.9 ± 36.4 lb vs 175.7 ± 37.7 lb, P < .001). At the end of the study, 34 patients (48.6%) preferred DTE, 13 (18.6%) preferred L-T₄, and 23 (32.9%) had no preference. In the subgroup analyses, those who preferred DTE lost 4 lb during the DTE treatment, and their subjective symptoms were significantly better while taking DTE, as measured by the general health questionnaire-12 and thyroid symptom questionnaire (P < .001 for both). Five variables were predictors of preference for DTE.

In conclusion, DTE therapy did not result in a significant improvement in quality of life; however, DTE caused modest weight loss, and nearly half of the participants preferred it over L-T₄.

### Evidence-based use of levothyroxine/liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism: A consensus document [^112DtQc5]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Fourteen clinical trials have not shown a consistent benefit of combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3). Despite the publication of these trials, combination therapy is widely used, and patients reporting benefit continue to generate patient and physician interest in this area. Recent scientific developments may provide insight into this inconsistency and guide future studies.

- **Methods**: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Thyroid Association (ETA) held a joint conference on November 3, 2019 (live-streamed between Chicago and London) to review new basic science and clinical evidence regarding combination therapy, with presentations and input from 12 content experts. After the presentations, the material was synthesized and used to develop summary statements of the state of knowledge. After review and revision of the material and summary statements, there was agreement that there was equipoise for a new clinical trial of combination therapy. Consensus statements encapsulating the implications of the material discussed with respect to the design of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy were generated. Authors voted upon the consensus statements. Iterative changes were made in several rounds of voting and after comments from ATA/BTA/ETA members.

- **Results**: Of 34 consensus statements available for voting, 28 received at least 75% agreement, with 13 receiving 100% agreement. Those with 100% agreement included studies being powered to study the effect of deiodinase.

### Treatment preferences in patients with hypothyroidism [^1166tj45]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (L-T4) monotherapy is the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. A minority of L-T4-treated patients remain symptomatic and report better outcomes with combination therapy that contains liothyronine (L-T3) or with desiccated thyroid extract (DTE).

- **Objective**: This work aimed to assess patient preferences in the treatment of hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: A systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-regression, and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatments for adults with hypothyroidism (L-T4 vs L-T4 + L-T3 or DTE) was conducted. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to April 10, 2024. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by four researchers.

- **Results**: Eleven RCTs (eight crossover studies) with a total of 1,135 patients were considered. Overall, 24% of patients preferred L-T4, while 52% preferred L-T4 + L-T3 or DTE; 24% had no preference. The meta-analysis confirmed the preference for combination therapy over L-T4 monotherapy (relative risk [RR]: 2.20; 95% CI, 1.38–3.52; p = 0.0009). Excluding four studies reduced the high heterogeneity (I2 = 81%) without affecting the results (RR: 1.97; 95% CI, 1.52–2.54; P < .00001; I2 = 24%). This preference profile remained when only crossover studies were considered (RR: 2.84; 95% CI, 1.50–5.39; P < .00001). Network meta-analysis confirmed the preference for DTE and L-T3 + L-T4 vs L-T4 alone.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with hypothyroidism prefer combination therapy (L-T3 + L-T4 or DTE) over L-T4 monotherapy. The strength of these findings is noteworthy.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112igscD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our results reveal that combined T4 + T3 therapy does not significantly alter TSH levels, yet it influences free T3 levels, aligning with findings from previous research. Our analysis also shows a notably lower total T4 and a higher total T3 with combined therapy. This supports that combined therapy improves T3 levels, which could help patients with issues in the conversion of T4 to T3 in the peripheral tissues. The variable impacts on metabolic parameters and quality of life, as noted in prior studies on T4 + T3 therapy, may be attributed to the subjective nature of quality-of-life assessments and differing metrics utilized across studies.

Furthermore, our findings show that TSH and T3 levels change significantly with DTE. This suggests that natural formulations, which contain both T3 and T4, may have different biochemical but not clinical effects when compared to synthetic therapies. These observed discrepancies could stem from heterogeneity in patient populations, study designs, dosing regimens, and the sensitivity of assays used to measure thyroid hormone levels, highlighting the complexity and individual variability in thyroid hormone replacement therapy responses.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QkmHB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis assessed the effects of combined T4 + T3 therapy versus T4 monotherapy on psychological and quality-of-life measures across different studies, examining TSQ-36, GHQ-28, and BDI scores. The analysis showed no significant impact on quality of life as measured by TSQ-36 scores, with a mean difference of 0.27 (95% CI: -1.34 to 1.88) among 370 participants, suggesting that combined therapy does not significantly enhance quality of life compared to monotherapy.

Additionally, the analysis showed no significant impact on mental health and well-being with combined therapy. GHQ-28 scores among 280 participants revealed a mean difference of 1.71 (95% CI: -1.82 to 5.23), with a highly significant effect and no heterogeneity, pointing to a reliable benefit in mental health. However, depressive symptoms measured by BDI scores in 170 participants showed no significant changes (mean difference: -0.39, 95% CI: -2.41 to 1.62), confirming that combined T4 + T3 therapy does not significantly affect depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that while combined T4 + T3 therapy significantly improves mental health, it does not have a marked impact on overall quality of life or depressive symptoms compared to T4 monotherapy.

The risk of bias within the included studies was systematically evaluated across seven key domains, as shown in the Risk of Bias Summary (Supplementary Figure 1). Most studies exhibited a low risk of bias in random sequence generation and allocation.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112Tem61]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The main social factors associated with poor compliance include older age, irregular medical visits, poor knowledge about medications, lack of assistance when taking medication, affordability, a busy schedule, and the discontinuation of medications when symptomatic relief occurs. Drug-related factors contributing to poor compliance include the coadministration of multiple drugs, administration more than once per day, and the necessity for fasting condition administration. Additionally, approximately 50% of noncompliant patients have concomitant diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, Addison disease, obesity, heart failure, migraine, and mental disorders like bipolar disorder and depression. It is noteworthy that some patients with mental disorders may lose their insight and refuse to take medications without informing their medical practitioners.

The diagnosis of pseudomalabsorption should exclude other conditions affecting LT4 bioavailability. Clinically, most patients with thyroxine pseudomalabsorption deny noncompliance during medical history taking but are more likely to admit poor adherence during informal conversations with clinicians. A completely normal result in the LT4 absorption test in individuals suspected of having malabsorption is strongly suggestive of pseudomalabsorption. The LT4 absorption test involves the ingestion of a high dose of LT4 in a fasted state followed by serial blood tests for thyroid function.

In 2019, the Mayo Clinic published a standardized protocol for the LT4 absorption test (Fig. 4). Simsir and colleagues utilized this protocol to explore…

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XX8Tj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by the thyroid gland's inability to produce sufficient thyroid hormones, which are crucial for regulating metabolism and energy. This condition predominantly affects women and the elderly, impacting approximately 1–6% of the general population. It can range in severity from mild, often asymptomatic forms to severe complications like myxedema, with symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Despite the widespread use of synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) as standard treatment, which effectively normalizes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in most patients, a subset continues to experience persistent symptoms. This observation has spurred interest in exploring alternative treatment strategies, such as combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid extract (DTE).

LT4 monotherapy has long been the cornerstone of hypothyroidism management, prized for its ability to standardize dosages and ensure consistent potency. While LT4 effectively alleviates the primary symptoms of hypothyroidism and prevents long-term health issues associated with thyroid hormone deficiency, approximately 5–10% of patients report persistent symptoms such as fatigue and mood disturbances, even when TSH levels are normalized. These persistent symptoms suggest that TSH levels may not fully reflect the thyroid hormone status at the tissue level, highlighting the potential inadequacies of LT4 monotherapy in some patients and underscoring the complexity of thyroid hormone metabolism, including genetic variation.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112MpcZD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The prescription of liquid LT4 is promising and limited. As revealed by a meta-analysis by Laurent et al, based on eight prospective or randomized controlled studies, reduced TSH levels were observed in patients with malabsorption who were taking liquid formulations. However, TSH levels did not differ significantly between tablets and liquid preparations in the non-malabsorption group. Clinicians should follow the guidelines of the Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, namely, "liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects (1) with hampered LT4 absorption or (2) who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals for LT4 replacement". A web-based survey of Italian endocrinologists also supported the prescription of liquid LT4 for patients (3) with unexplained poor biochemical control of hypothyroidism. From a clinical standpoint, we also recommend the prescription of liquid LT4 for patients (4) with difficulty swallowing.

- **Soft gel capsules**: Commercial soft gel capsules were introduced to the market around the same time as LT4 solutions, but somewhat later (in August 2007). The LT4 powder is dissolved in glycerin solvent and then encapsulated with a soft gelatin shell. After drying, a translucent flat oval capsule is produced. Colucci et al. conducted a clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers according to the Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacokinetic protocol for bioequivalence. The study confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence between LT4 soft gel capsules and tablets. However, controversy still exists. Data from 104 hypothyroid patients show…

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^111cpkBq]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, it is advised to avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving quality of life or modulating body weight, as these are not useful.

### Efficacy of levothyroxine sodium soft gelatin capsules in thyroidectomized patients taking proton pump inhibitors: An open-label study [^112qaJAX]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine sodium (LT4) is the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism. In patients with no significant comorbidities, the recommended LT4 full replacement dose is approximately 1.6–1.7 μg/kg/day. The absorption of oral LT4 occurs in the small intestine, and several factors, including medications, may interfere with it. This interference necessitates LT4 dose adjustments and more careful monitoring.

In the stomach, the degree and rate of LT4 dissolution are essential for efficient absorption and relate directly to gastric acidity. In vitro studies have shown that an increase in medium pH affects the dissolution of LT4 tablets. Similarly, an increase in gastric pH may affect dissolution and subsequent LT4 absorption. Drugs that block the secretion of gastric acid, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), cause hypochlorhydria and affect thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. Omeprazole treatment was associated with an increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels in 10 patients treated with LT4 tablets, an effect that was reversed by an increase in the LT4 dose by 37%.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine+liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^115fCFxj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

All study participants, physician investigators, those administering the neurocognitive tests, and those analyzing test results were blinded throughout the study. Baseline assessments were obtained before randomization, whereas patients were taking either LT4, LT4 + LT3, or DTE.

Subsequently, patients were randomized into one of three groups and started on the study medications. All medications were given once daily, in the morning, on an empty stomach with water only. Other medications, if any, were given at least one hour later. Adherence was evaluated through interviews, counting the number of remaining capsules, monitoring refills, and evaluating the thyroid function tests.

Each study medication was administered during a study period of 22 weeks as follows:

- **Dose adjustment**: After the first six weeks on the medication, TSH levels were checked, and the dose adjusted to maintain TSH levels between 0.27 and 4.20. The adjustment was performed by a physician who had no other contact with the study patients. Adjustments were made by increasing or decreasing the dosage of the study medication. If the TSH was out of range, the next higher or lower dosage was used.

- **Blinded evaluation**: The physician performing the evaluations did not know the dose of the study medications the patients were taking.

With the serum TSH level within the desired range, patients continued on the study medication for an additional 16 weeks, completing the study period. Subsequently, patients were crossed over to the next treatment phase.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend maintaining treatment with the same brand or preparation of levothyroxine in patients who have optimal biochemical hormonal replacement and no clinical contraindications. If a change becomes necessary due to clinical reasons, a measurement of fT4 and TSH should be obtained after 6 weeks.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone stability in patients prescribed synthetic or desiccated thyroid products: A retrospective study [^114r6Zau]. Annals of Family Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this retrospective matched-cohort study was to evaluate the stability of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients using synthetic compared with desiccated thyroid products. Patients using a thyroid product for the treatment of hypothyroidism were matched 1:1 on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and had a follow-up period of 3 years after the index date. The primary outcome was the percentage of in-range TSH values. Over 3 years, TSH values in both groups were in range 79% of the time (P = 0.905). Our results showed no difference in longitudinal TSH stability between desiccated thyroid products and synthetic levothyroxine.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^116JwY75]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Although levothyroxine is one of the most prescribed medications in the world, its bioavailability has been reported to be impaired by many factors, including interfering drugs or foods and concomitant diseases, resulting in persistent hypothyroidism despite high doses of levothyroxine. Persistent hypothyroidism can also be induced by noninterchangeability between formulations and poor compliance.

To address these issues, several strategies have been developed. Novel formulations, such as liquid solutions and soft gel capsules, have been designed to eliminate malabsorption. Alternative delivery routes, including injections, suppositories, sprays, and sublingual and transdermal administrations, aim to circumvent dosing difficulties, such as thyroid emergencies and dysphagia. Moreover, nanomaterials have been utilized to develop delivery systems for the sustained release of levothyroxine, thereby improving patient compliance and reducing costs. Some delivery systems encapsulating nanoparticles show promising release profiles.

In this review, we first summarize the medical conditions that interfere with the bioavailability of oral levothyroxine and discuss the underlying mechanisms and treatments. The efficacy of liquid solutions and soft gel capsules is systematically evaluated. We further summarize the novel delivery routes for levothyroxine and their possible applications. Nanomaterials in the levothyroxine field are then discussed and compared based on their load and release profile. We hope the article provides novel insights into the drug delivery of levothyroxine.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine+liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^112EGe2D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Serum TSH remained within the normal reference range and varied minimally among the three treatment arms, although levels were slightly higher in DTE-treated patients. In contrast, serum T3 and T4 levels were substantially affected by both treatment arms that contained T3: fasting total T3 was 30% to 50% higher and serum T4 levels were approximately 30% lower when patients were on therapy with DTE or LT4 + LT3. There was a 38% drop in the total T4/T3 ratio after the patients crossed over to LT4 + LT3 and a 56% drop after they crossed over to DTE. The changes in T4/T3 ratio reflect the changes in serum T4 and T3 levels and remained within the normal reference range (22.7–150). These values, however, are not fully representative of the 24-hour period for the short half-life of T3.

Serum reverse T3, T3 resin, and free T4 were also affected, as expected. Body weight, serum lipid levels (i.e. total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), as well as SHBG and leptin serum levels were not different during the different treatment arms. Although blood pressure was not different among the three treatment arms, heart rate was minimally increased while patients were on the DTE treatment arm.

- **Treatment preference**: Most patients indicated a treatment preference at the end of the trial, but four patients had no preference; two patients ranked LT4 as the best and ranked both DTE and LT4/LT3 combination in second place.

### Liothyronine and desiccated thyroid extract in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^116nrAhM]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

The basis for the treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (LT4) is that humans activate T4 to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus, while normalizing serum thyrotropin (TSH), LT4 doses should also restore the body's reservoir of T3. However, there is evidence that T3 is not fully restored in LT4-treated patients. For patients who remain symptomatic on LT4 therapy, clinical guidelines recommend, on a trial basis, therapy with LT4+LT3. Reducing the LT4 dose by 25 mcg/day and adding 2.5–7.5 mcg liothyronine (LT3) once or twice a day is an appropriate starting point. Transient episodes of hypertriiodothyroninemia with these doses of LT4 and LT3 are unlikely to go above the reference range and have not been associated with adverse drug reactions.

Trials following almost 1,000 patients for almost 1 year indicate that, similar to LT4, therapy with LT4+LT3 can restore euthyroidism while maintaining a normal serum TSH. An observational study of 400 patients with a mean follow-up of approximately 9 years did not indicate increased mortality or morbidity risk due to cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, or fractures after adjusting for age when compared with patients taking only LT4. Desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) is a form of combination therapy in which the LT4/LT3 ratio is approximately 4:1; the mean daily dose of DTE needed to normalize serum TSH contains around 11 mcg T3, but some patients may require higher doses. The DTE remains outside formal FDA oversight, and consistency of T4 and T3 contents is monitored by the manufacturers only.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^11412DRx]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Over a century has elapsed since Murray treated cases of myxedema with a SC injection of sheep thyroid extract for the first time. Although LT4 was successfully isolated from porcine thyroid extracts in 1914, animal-derived DTE was still the only choice for the treatment of hypothyroidism before the 1940s. In 1950, LT4 salt was synthesized successfully and was introduced to the market. LT4 salt rapidly replaced DTE and became the standard therapy for hypothyroidism as there were fewer adverse effects and more accurate dosing. LT4 tablets are currently one of the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide. However, as mentioned above, many conditions can reduce the bioavailability of oral LT4 tablets. To overcome this issue, novel formulations (e.g. liquid LT4 and soft gel capsules) and new systems (nanomaterial-based systems) with different administration routes (e.g. par rectum, IM injection, etc) have been developed.

- **Timeline of seminal discoveries**: The earliest available report about commercial liquid LT4 can be traced back to 2001 (manufacturer: Sanofi-Synthelabo/Henning Berlin). However, there is no doubt that the emergence of extemporaneous oral solution was much earlier since there were lots of articles on the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism and myxedema coma.

### The history and future of treatment of hypothyroidism [^112dnWNy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement has been used for more than a century to treat hypothyroidism. Natural thyroid preparations, such as thyroid extract, desiccated thyroid, or thyroglobulin, which contain both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), were the first pharmacologic treatments available and dominated the market for the better part of the 20th century. Dosages were adjusted to resolve symptoms and to normalize the basal metabolic rate and/or serum protein-bound iodine level, but thyrotoxic adverse effects were not uncommon.

Two major developments in the 1970s led to a transition in clinical practice:

1. **Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay**: This led to the discovery that many patients were overtreated, resulting in a dramatic reduction in thyroid hormone replacement dosage.

2. **Identification of peripheral deiodinase-mediated T4-to-T3 conversion**: This provided a physiologic means to justify l-thyroxine monotherapy, obviating concerns about inconsistencies with desiccated thyroid.

Thereafter, l-thyroxine monotherapy at doses to normalize the serum TSH became the standard of care. Since then, a subgroup of thyroid hormone-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism, despite normalization of the serum TSH, has been identified. This has brought into question the inability of l-thyroxine monotherapy to universally normalize serum T3 levels. New research suggests mechanisms for the inadequacies of l-thyroxine monotherapy and highlights the possible role for personalized medicine based on deiodinase polymorphisms.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115GAK6v]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The daily dose of LT4 is determined by lean body mass, while age, the etiology of hypothyroidism, comorbidities, and other factors also exert effects. In general, patients are initially prescribed a dose of 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight/day and are tested for thyroid function every 6 to 8 weeks. Once thyroid hormones (THs) remain within the reference ranges, an annual examination is recommended to monitor thyroid function. A persistent TSH elevation despite the administration of a daily dose of > 1.9 µg/kg/day is deemed refractory hypothyroidism, which entails further examinations for potential causes.

The leading cause of refractory hypothyroidism is interfering medications, given that more than 50% of LT4-treated patients are concurrently taking > 1 drug for other medical conditions. Some concomitant diseases, such as atrophic gastritis, lactose intolerance, and celiac disease, might also impair the bioavailability of oral LT4. A switch of brand or generic LT4 and improper storage have also been reported to cause TSH fluctuation in patients, which may be attributed to different pharmacokinetic profiles due to excipients. Poor patient adherence to medication is another common cause of refractory hypothyroidism. Patients may sometimes miss a dose or ingest LT4 with breakfast for convenience, a practice observed in 30% to 70% of patients.

Tablet is the predominant LT4 formulation. The majority of patients can achieve biological euthyroidism with oral LT4 supplements.

### Combination treatment with T4 and T3: Toward personalized replacement therapy in hypothyroidism [^114dAJph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy is the traditional lifelong replacement treatment for hypothyroid patients. In recent years, new evidence has prompted clinicians to evaluate the option of combined T3 and T4 treatment to improve the quality of life, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action in hypothyroidism. The aim of this review is to assess the physiological basis and the results of studies on this topic.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms:
	- **Thyroid conditions and treatments**: hypothyroidism, levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid, guidelines, treatment
	- **Physiological and clinical markers**: deiodinases, clinical symptoms, quality of life, cognition, mood, depression, body weight, heart rate, cholesterol, bone markers, SHBG
	- **Patient perspectives**: patient preference for combined therapy

	The search was restricted to reports published in English since 1970, but some reports published before 1970 were also incorporated. We supplemented the search with records from personal files and references of relevant articles and textbooks. Parameters analyzed included the rationale for combination treatment, the type of patients to be selected, the optimal T4/T3 ratio, and the potential benefits of this therapy on symptoms of hypothyroidism, quality of life, mood, cognition, and peripheral parameters of thyroid hormone action.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The outcome of our analysis suggests that it may be time to consider a personalized regimen of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients.

- **Conclusions**: Further prospective randomized controlled studies are needed.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116P44TG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid hormone replacement therapies in hypothyroidism, revealing that combined T4 + T3 therapy and desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) offer distinct biochemical profiles compared to T4 monotherapy, yet do not significantly impact a range of clinical outcomes. Notably, combined therapy does not alter TSH levels but significantly affects total T4 and T3 levels, suggesting specific biochemical changes without corresponding clinical benefits regarding lipid profile, cardiovascular risk markers, and quality of life measures. However, a significant improvement in mental health and well-being with combined therapy emerges as a potential benefit, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies.

The observed high heterogeneity across studies underscores the complexity of thyroid hormone therapy and the importance of individual patient factors in treatment decisions, paving the way for more tailored and nuanced approaches to managing hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^114PQwXT]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Although combined treatment sounds promising, the results from clinical trials comparing monotherapy and combined therapy are conflicting. In a previous study involving 19 patients, the TSH levels were normalized only when patients' T3 levels were not significantly different from those of controls. The results are inconsistent with those of more recent double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on RCTs failed to show any advantages in quality of life, mood states, or psychometric performance for patients receiving combination therapy. Although previous meta-analyses reported a preference for combined therapy by patients, a more recent meta-analysis based on 7 blinded RCTs did not support this conclusion, suggesting that T3 may serve as a "placebo" and raise patients' expectations in some nonblinded studies.

Taken together, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association, the use of combined replacement therapy, with the administration of both LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), is generally not recommended due to the low quality of the available evidence. A trial may be considered in those patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Also, in these cases, the presence of coexistent nonthyroid problems should be first ruled out. We further recommend discussing the financial burdens with these patients while addressing concomitant diseases and mitigating their unrealistic expectations.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine + liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^11422K6m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Primary outcome measures included performance in the WMS-IV test, BDI, TSQ, and GHQ-12 questionnaires. Sub-analyses included thyroid function tests, body weight and lipid profile, treatment preference, etiology of hypothyroidism, and group sub-analysis.

- **Statistical analysis**: On the basis of a previous study by Clyde et al, using the TSQ index as the outcome measure, the means of the two groups (LT4 and combination LT4 + T3) were 58 and 50 with the respective standard deviations of 23 and 12. Sample size for this crossover study was based on a paired t-test with a 5%, two-sided significance level and assumed a standard deviation of 23 and a within-subjects correlation of 0.5. A sample size of 67 is required for 80% power to detect a difference of 8 points on the TSQ. Accounting for a dropout rate of up to 25%, the necessary sample size is estimated to be 90 enrollees.

- **Primary outcome**: Differences between treatments were evaluated using mixed-effects models. The primary outcome model included a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect of subject. Models were run with and without the inclusion of baseline scores to isolate between treatment differences. In follow-up analysis of the primary outcome, scores for the LT4 monotherapy condition were also treated as baseline in an adjusted model to isolate effects in the other two experimental conditions. The difference between treatments was tested using linear contrasts of the marginal means with Tukey adjustments for between-treatment comparisons.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Present text truncated.

### Individualized therapy for hypothyroidism: Is T4 enough for everyone [^111MZC9u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that some hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine (LT4) remain symptomatic, but why patients are susceptible to this condition, why symptoms persist, and what is the role of combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) are questions that remain unclear. Here we explore evidence of abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) metabolism in LT4-treated patients and offer a rationale for why some patients perceive LT4 therapy as a failure.

- **Evidence acquisition**: This review is based on a collection of primary and review literature gathered from a PubMed search of "hypothyroidism", "levothyroxine", "liothyronine", and "desiccated thyroid extract", among other keywords. PubMed searches were supplemented by Google Scholar and the authors' prior knowledge of the subject.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In most LT4-treated patients, normalization of serum thyrotropin levels results in a decreased serum T3/T4 ratio, with relatively lower serum T3 levels; in at least 15% of the cases, serum T3 levels are below normal. These changes can lead to a reduction in TH action, which would explain the slower rate of metabolism and elevated serum cholesterol levels. A small percentage of patients might also experience persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism, with impaired cognition and tiredness. We propose that such patients carry a key clinical factor, for example, specific genetic and/or immunologic makeup, that is well compensated while the thyroid function is normal but might become apparent when compounded with relatively lower serum T3 levels.

- **Conclusions**: After excluding other causes, further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings.

Our meta-analysis explored the effects of combined T4 and T3 therapy versus T4 monotherapy on thyroid hormone levels in patients with hypothyroidism, drawing from studies with diverse methodologies and participant demographics.

- **Effect of T4 + T3 on thyroid hormone levels**: The analysis of TSH levels in 794 participants across ten studies showed no significant difference with a mean change of 0.20 (95% CI: -0.63 to 1.04), confirmed by statistical tests indicating non-significance (P = 0.63). In contrast, the examination of total T4 levels from four studies with 336 participants revealed that subjects on combined therapy had significantly lower levels (mean difference: -2.20, 95% CI: -3.03 to -1.37), with results proving statistically significant (P < 0.00001).

Similarly, analysis of free T4 levels from 757 participants across ten studies demonstrated a significantly lower level (mean difference: -0.34, 95% CI: -0.47 to -0.20), also statistically significant (P < 0.00001). Furthermore, the investigation of total T3 levels in 431 participants from six studies found a significantly higher level with combined therapy (mean difference: 29.82, 95% CI: 22.40 to 37.25), with this effect confirmed as statistically significant (P < 0.00001). The studies demonstrated varying degrees of heterogeneity.

These results highlight the varying impacts of combined T4 and T3 therapy on thyroid hormones, indicating significant differences from traditional T4 monotherapy in the treatment of hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115QsyGh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The protocol for the LT4 absorption test and the simulated alteration of serum total T4 levels requires thorough preparation. Patient medical history should be reviewed, and any conditions that could impair LT4 bioavailability must be ruled out before initiating the test.

After an overnight fast, the patient ingests a high dose of LT4, usually in tablet form, with water. The standardized dose is determined by the patient's age and body mass index (BMI), typically 1000 µg for patients aged between 18 and 65 with a BMI of 65. Blood samples are collected over a 6-hour period (at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours, respectively) and are tested for total T4 and TSH levels. At the completion of the test, vital signs and symptoms are reassessed. During the test, no food or medication is permitted.

The duration of the LT4 absorption test can be extended to 72 hours post-dosing (without fasting) or shortened to 2 hours. LT4 absorption is calculated using the following formula: % Absorbed = [Increment TT4 (µg/dL) × 10/total administered LT4 (µg)] × Vd (L) × 100, where Increment TT4 is the peak TT4 minus baseline TT4, and Vd (volume of distribution) is calculated as 0.442 × BMI.

A 60% absorption rate is considered normal, which indicates pseudomalabsorption. Abbreviations: Vd, volume of distribution.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^1158QLCG]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

LT4 malabsorption can also be induced by intestinal surgery and diseases. Since approximately 70% of oral LT4 is absorbed in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, jejunostomy and bowel resection lead to a substantial decrease in drug absorption. Some patients with short bowel syndrome have been reported to be refractory to oral LT4; therefore, alternative routes such as rectal administration or subcutaneous injection were recommended. Jejunoileal bypass, in which more than 50% of the distal intestine is bypassed, was reported to impair LT4 absorption in one patient. In addition to surgery, lactose intolerance and celiac disease are among the most frequent intestinal diseases responsible for malabsorption. They may both impair intestinal absorption of drugs and nutrients via hydrolysis and complexation. Another cause of LT4 malabsorption is intestinal parasitosis. Giardiasis and Enterobius vermicularis can damage intestinal mucosal cells and subsequently decrease LT4 absorption. Notably, critically ill patients may exhibit reduced intestinal absorption of LT4 and increased conversion of T4 to rT3, regardless of the causes of the critical illness. Some other intestinal dysfunctions, such as intestinal lymphangiectasia and ulcerative colitis, have been revealed to cause impaired LT4 absorption, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Aside from gastrointestinal disorders, LT4 malabsorption is associated with other diseases involving solid organs or other conditions. Cystic fibrosis was reported to impair LT4 absorption in one patient. This phenomenon might be explained by cystic fibrosis–associated pancreas dysfunction.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VY5YT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

However, the study's methodology is not without weaknesses. One significant issue is the high heterogeneity observed in some outcomes, suggesting substantial variability across studies, which could stem from differences in study populations, interventions, or methodologies. This raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, by excluding studies not published in English, the study potentially overlooks significant research. This introduces language bias and raises concerns about publication bias, particularly regarding studies with negative or inconclusive results. These strengths and weaknesses collectively highlight the study's comprehensive yet somewhat restricted approach to evaluating thyroid hormone therapies.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112GMb8Q]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The ideal normalization of thyroid hormone (TH) levels in patients with hypothyroidism relies on the elimination of or an improvement in conditions such as parasitosis or H. pylori infection, where thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels usually return to the target range with a normal dose after antiparasitic or antibiotic therapy. A lactose-free formulation or gluten-free diet can alleviate impaired absorption in patients with lactose intolerance or celiac disease, respectively. Additionally, switching from levothyroxine (LT4) tablets to liquid preparations can restore thyroid function in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Interestingly, liquid solutions also address malabsorption induced by some nongastrointestinal disorders such as nephrotic syndrome and pregnancy.

Similarly, crushed tablet powder may resolve hypothyroidism caused by bariatric surgery and lactose intolerance. Unusual administration routes, including intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injections, can decrease unsuppressed TSH levels in patients with digestive tract disorders. Clinicians should note that severe refractory hypothyroidism is uncommon in patients with concomitant diseases or conditions. Many patients with malabsorption achieve serum TSH levels in the target range with an increased dose of LT4.

### Impaired enteral levothyroxine absorption in hypothyroidism refractory to oral therapy after thyroid ablation for papillary thyroid cancer: Case report and kinetic studies [^117ApiN8]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

We present a 49-year-old patient suffering from hypothyroidism (thyrotropin [TSH], 20–80 mU/L) refractory to oral levothyroxine (LT(4)) substitution after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy for papillary thyroid cancer. Extensive, repetitive work-up excluded small bowel, liver, and pancreatic disease and drug interactions. Triiodothyronine/thyroxine (T(3)/T(4)) antibodies were negative, and reverse T(3) levels were normal. Supervised absorption tests of several LT(4) preparations in increasing dosages (250–1500 microg/d) confirmed an insufficient rise in serum T(4) levels following oral drug administration. Thus, intravenous LT(4) application (5 times per week) was commenced to restore at least normal range TSH levels.

Repetition of absorption tests 1 year later, following a documented period of more than 3 months of stable euthyroidism, showed a considerable improvement of intestinal LT(4) uptake. Subsequently, the patient was managed on large doses of oral LT(4) (1500–2100 microg/d) alone, but this was found to be insufficient, so continuous intravenous LT(4) was administered via a morphine pump device to ultimately achieve stable euthyroidism. Notably, at the 4-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurring or metastasized papillary thyroid cancer. The reason for the disturbed intestinal LT(4) absorption in this patient remains unresolved. However, we suggest the possibility of a specific intestinal uptake deficit, which will only become apparent in the case of previous thyroid ablation.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JbqvH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

DTE, commonly known as Nature Thyroid, presents a distinct biochemical profile compared to synthetic levothyroxine (LT4), containing not only T4 and T3 but also additional thyroid hormones like T2 and calcitonin. This comprehensive hormonal composition may more closely mimic the natural output of the thyroid gland, potentially leading to improved symptom management for some patients. Many patients report a preference for DTE over LT4, often due to better relief from symptoms such as fatigue, mental fog, and difficulties with weight management, which are not as effectively addressed by LT4 alone. Additionally, genetic variations that impair the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 may make DTE, which directly supplies both hormones, particularly beneficial for these individuals. Furthermore, some studies suggest that DTE may promote weight loss and improve metabolic parameters, possibly due to the direct metabolic effects of T3. While DTE may offer advantages for certain subgroups of patients, especially those who do not achieve optimal results with LT4, it should be used cautiously, tailored to individual needs, and supported by more definitive, large-scale clinical trials to fully understand its long-term efficacy compared to LT4.

Our meta-analysis does not suggest any clinical benefits of DTE or combined T4 and T3 supplementation over T4 therapy alone in the broader population.

These results highlight the complexity of thyroid hormone replacement therapy and the need for individualized treatment approaches.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine+liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^1116fwMY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The rationale behind thyroid hormone replacement therapy is to administer thyroid hormone in a way that restores thyroid hormone signaling in all tissues. Serum TSH has traditionally been used to adjust the dose of levothyroxine that presumably achieves this goal. However, the normalization of serum TSH is achieved through a slightly elevated serum T4 and reduced serum T3 levels. TSH was higher in the DTE arm but still within the normal range. It was difficult to make DTE and LT4 doses bioequivalent. It is not known whether these small changes in serum T3 and T4 modify thyroid hormone signaling. The observation in the present investigation that replacement therapy containing T3 or DTE (which also contains T3) slightly elevates serum T3 and reduces serum T4, while mitigating the residual symptoms of hypothyroidism, suggests a causal relationship. Nonetheless, our findings are clear that no correlation between serum T3 and outcomes could be established in the present investigation, not even in the subanalyses. This apparent conundrum suggests that intracellular T3 levels, which are affected by both serum T3 and locally generated T3, might be playing a role.

It is well known that thyroid hormone plays a role in the development of an adult brain, as documented by the modifications in mood, behavior, and cognition observed during the transition from hypo- to euthyroidism and to hyperthyroidism. In fact, the human temporal pole responds promptly to minimal changes in thyroid hormone signaling. Unique about the brain is that thyroid hormone signaling exhibits additional layers of complexity.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^112wunJX]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy formulations, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend conducting a thorough interview regarding drugs concomitantly used by patients treated with levothyroxine. Discontinuing the interfering drug is advised when possible. If discontinuation is not feasible, it is important to schedule an appropriate lag time between levothyroxine and the interfering drug. Additionally, it is recommended to adjust the dose of levothyroxine for the treatment period in cases where interference is expected due to drugs prescribed for more than two weeks.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment adherence, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a levothyroxine absorption test in levothyroxine-refractory patients, after excluding nutrients, drugs, and known interference from comorbidities, when clinically appropriate.

### Are bioequivalence studies of levothyroxine sodium formulations in euthyroid volunteers reliable [^113nNR6Z]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) has a narrow therapeutic index; consequently, precise standards for assessing the bioequivalence of different LT4 products are vital. We examined the methodology that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends for comparing the bioavailability of LT4 products, as well as three modifications to correct for endogenous thyroxine (T4) levels, to determine if the methodology could distinguish LT4 products that differ by 12.5%, 25%, or 33%.

Without baseline correction for the endogenous T4 pool, differences in administered LT4 doses that differed by 25%-33% could not be detected when comparing 450 microg and 400 microg doses versus a 600 microg dose, respectively. The three mathematical correction methods could distinguish the doses that differed by 25% and 33%; however, none of the correction methods could distinguish dosage strengths that differed by 12.5% (450 microg versus 400 microg). Dose differences within this range are known to result in clinically relevant differences in safety and effectiveness.

Methods of analysis of bioequivalence data that do not consider endogenous T4 concentrations confound accurate quantitation and interpretation of LT4 bioavailability. As a result, products inappropriately deemed bioequivalent may put patients at risk for iatrogenic hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. More precise methods for defining bioequivalence are required to ensure that LT4 products accepted as bioequivalent will perform equivalently in patients without the need for further monitoring and retitration of their dose.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^115tZkxQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the mainstay therapy for hypothyroidism, but its bioavailability can be hampered by many conditions such as concomitant diseases, interfering medications and foods, brand switching, and noncompliance. A comprehensive medical history taking with necessary examinations is required to find the cause of persistent hypothyroidism. Discontinuation of interferants, administration separation, addressing concomitant diseases, and close monitoring are generally recommended to eliminate persistent hypothyroidism.

Liquid solutions and soft gel capsules are recommended for those with hampered LT4 absorption and who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals for LT4 replacement. Liquid solutions can also be used for those with difficulty in swallowing. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections can serve as sustained-release systems for levothyroxine, especially for noncompliant patients. Subcutaneous implants with nanomaterials can serve as sustained-release platforms for LT4 and thus improve patient compliance. Novel drug delivery systems with larger loads, stable release profiles, and safety are expected to be developed in the future.

The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3% to 7% in the general population. Hypothyroidism is mainly induced by autoimmune thyroid diseases and thyroidectomy. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on laboratory tests of serum thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Since the 1980s, along with the discovery of T4 de…

### Switching levothyroxine from the tablet to the oral solution formulation corrects the impaired absorption of levothyroxine induced by proton-pump inhibitors [^112twjrb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) impair tablet levothyroxine (LT4) intestinal absorption by increasing the gastric pH and decreasing LT4 dissolution in the stomach.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to verify whether a liquid formulation of LT4 would correct LT4 malabsorption induced by PPIs.

- **Design**: This was a prospective observational cohort study. The study was conducted from 2012 to 2013, and the mean duration of the follow-up was 23.7 ± 11.9 weeks.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital outpatient clinic.

- **Patients**: Upon informed consent, we recruited 24 consecutive adult patients (18 women and 6 men), who took LT4 for replacement (n = 14) or suppressive purposes (n = 10), and who had absorption of tablet LT4 impaired by PPIs.

- **Intervention**: The 24 patients were switched from the tablet to the oral solution LT4 at the same daily dose.

- **Main outcome measures**: Significantly lower mean TSH levels were seen with the oral solution than with the tablet, as were significantly greater rates of serum TSH less than or equal to the specified cutoff values (replacement [REP] group) or ≤ 0.10 mU/L (suppressive [SUP] group) with the oral solution than with the tablet.

- **Results**: Serum TSH was lower with the oral solution than with the tablet formulation (REP group, 1.7 ± 1.0 mU/L vs. 5.4 ± 4.3, P < .0001; SUP group, 0.1 ± 0.3 mU/L vs. 2.1 ± 2.7, P < .0001). In the REP group, the rate of TSH values of ≤ 4.12 or ≤ 2.5 mU/L was 29 of 30 (96.7%) or 24 of 30 (80.0%) postswitch, but only 17 of 36 (47.2%) or 9 of 36 (25.0%) preswitch (P < .0001).

### Armour thyroid [^1127TFcy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Animal studies have shown that levothyroxine (T4) is only partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The degree of absorption depends on the vehicle used for its administration and the character of the intestinal contents, including intestinal flora, plasma protein, and soluble dietary factors, all of which bind thyroid and thereby make it unavailable for diffusion. Only 41% is absorbed when given in a gelatin capsule, compared to 74% absorption when given with an albumin carrier.

	- Depending on other factors, absorption has varied from 48 to 79% of the administered dose. Fasting increases absorption. Malabsorption syndromes, as well as dietary factors (such as children's soybean formula and concomitant use of anionic exchange resins like cholestyramine), cause excessive fecal loss. Liothyronine (T3) is almost totally absorbed, with 95% absorbed in 4 hours. The hormones contained in desiccated thyroid extract preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to synthetic hormones.

	- More than 99% of circulating hormones are bound to serum proteins, including thyroid-binding globulin (TBg), thyroid-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBa), whose capacities and affinities vary for the hormones. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both TBg and TBPA compared to liothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed upon, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on the initial levothyroxine dosage, alongside considerations of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted, can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment.

For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life including coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be a benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This approach is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials but may be endorsed by other studies that provide lower-quality evidence and animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is observed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has been under discussion.

### Gastrointestinal malabsorption of thyroxine [^112fTtaR]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine, a widely prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic index, is often a lifelong treatment. The therapeutic efficacy of T4 may be marred by behavioral, pharmacologic, and pathologic issues acting as interfering factors. Despite a continuous search for optimal T4 treatment, a significant number of patients fail to show a complete chemical and/or clinical response to this reference dose of T4. Gastrointestinal malabsorption of oral T4 represents an emerging cause of refractory hypothyroidism and may be more frequent than previously thought.

In this review, we examine the pharmacologic features of T4 preparations and their linkage with the intestinal absorption of the hormone. We emphasize the major biochemical and pharmacologic characteristics of T4 and its interaction with the putative transporter at the intestinal level. Furthermore, we examine the interfering role of nutrients, foods, and drugs on T4 absorption at the gastric and intestinal levels. The impact of gastrointestinal disorders on T4 treatment efficacy is analyzed in relation to the site of action and the interfering mechanisms. Based on the evidence obtained from the literature, we propose a schematic diagnostic workup for the most frequent and often hidden gastrointestinal diseases impairing T4 absorption.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine+liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^112sbEmW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Studies comparing levothyroxine (LT4) therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3) or desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) did not detect consistent superiority of either treatment. Here, we investigated these therapies, focusing on the whole group of LT4-treated hypothyroid patients, while also exploring the most symptomatic patients.

- **Methodology**: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 75 hypothyroid patients randomly allocated to one of three treatment arms: LT4, LT4 + LT3, and DTE, for 22 weeks. The primary outcomes were posttreatment scores on the 36-point thyroid symptom questionnaire (TSQ-36), 12-point quality of life general health questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Wechsler memory scale-version IV (VMS-IV), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary endpoints included treatment preference, biochemical and metabolic parameters, etiology of hypothyroidism, and Thr92Ala-DIO2 gene polymorphism. Analyses were performed with a linear mixed model using subject as a random factor and group as a fixed effect.

- **Results**: Serum TSH remained within the reference range across all treatment arms. There were no differences for primary and secondary outcomes, except for a minor increase in heart rate caused by DTE. Treatment preference was not different and there were no interferences of the etiology of hypothyroidism or Thr92Ala-DIO2 gene polymorphism in the outcomes. Subgroup analyses of the one-third most symptomatic patients on LT4 revealed a strong preference for treatment containing T3, which improved performance on TSQ-36, GHQ-12, BDI, and visual memory index.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hkmQ8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis evaluated the effects of desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) versus T4 monotherapy on a variety of thyroid-related parameters across several studies, involving a total of 290 participants. The analysis revealed that DTE treatment led to statistically significant higher TSH levels with a mean difference of 0.49, suggesting higher TSH levels compared to T4 monotherapy. Similarly, there were significantly lower total T4 levels with a mean difference of -3.11, indicating a robust low level due to DTE treatment. For free T4, both methods — standard measurement and direct dialysis — showed significantly lower levels with mean differences of -0.50 and -0.67, respectively. Furthermore, the meta-analysis noted a significantly low level of T3 resin uptake with a mean difference of -1.85, demonstrating a consistent effect across studies.

In terms of reverse T3 levels, the treatment with DTE also resulted in a significant lowering, with a mean difference of -7.88. Most notably, there were significantly higher total T3 levels, with a mean difference of 50.90, suggesting a substantial elevation in patients treated with DTE as compared to those on T4 monotherapy. This overall analysis highlights the considerable impact of DTE on thyroid function and hormone levels, indicating distinct effects in various thyroid-related parameters when compared to standard T4 monotherapy.
