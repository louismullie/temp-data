Breath holding spells

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about breath-holding spells in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining breath-holding spells and their clinical phenotypes. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and natural history. Next, I will examine pathophysiology, followed by a careful diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis. After that, I need to review treatment strategies, including iron therapy, pharmacologic options, and pacing for severe pallid spells. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, prognosis, and a concise management algorithm, while double-checking guideline alignment and evidence quality at each step [^114pEnnP] [^113VRbyL] [^117AmEjQ].

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't mislabel the entity. Breath-holding spells are paroxysmal, involuntary events in otherwise healthy children, classically divided into cyanotic and pallid forms, with a third "mixed" category when both features coexist; cyanotic spells follow crying or frustration with expiratory apnea and cyanosis, whereas pallid spells are often triggered by pain or fright with pallor and vagally mediated bradycardia or asystole, and both can culminate in transient loss of consciousness and brief convulsive movements due to cerebral hypoxia [^114pEnnP] [^113VRbyL] [^116H3fEW].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and natural history before I anchor on management. Onset is typically between 6 and 12 months, peaking around 12 to 18 months, and most children outgrow spells by school age; persistence beyond 8 years is uncommon, though case reports document rare continuation into late childhood, and prospective data suggest a median resolution around 3 to 3.5 years with a wide range, including up to 7 years in some cohorts [^111f912x] [^112CbStC] [^113VRbyL].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next, because it drives therapy. Cyanotic spells reflect prolonged expiratory apnea with Valsalva physiology, reduced venous return, and hypoxemia culminating in loss of consciousness; pallid spells reflect a vagal reflex with bradycardia or asystole causing cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope; autonomic dysregulation is implicated in both, and iron deficiency may worsen autonomic instability and irritability, increasing spell frequency, while oxidant–antioxidant imbalance has been hypothesized but remains less established [^114pEnnP] [^113ftyQ5] [^115SbybP] [^116YXLnU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about seizures; I should confirm the diagnostic approach. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on a characteristic history of a precipitating cry or fright, color change, brief loss of consciousness, and rapid recovery without postictal confusion; routine EEG is not indicated unless features suggest epilepsy, and ocular compression during EEG can provoke vagal asystole to distinguish reflex syncope from seizures, though it should be used judiciously and not as a routine screen; a 12-lead ECG is reasonable in recurrent or severe cases to screen for arrhythmias or prolonged QT, and iron studies should be obtained given the high prevalence of iron deficiency in affected children [^112Xt5Jj] [^111ohZoJ] [^1121a6Q2] [^115SbybP].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully so I don't miss red flags. Seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, structural heart disease, metabolic derangements, and psychogenic events should be considered; concerning features include spells without a clear trigger, prolonged unconsciousness with postictal confusion, abnormal neurologic examination, or family history of sudden death; in children with nocturnal "breath-holding", I should double-check for nocturnal seizures, GERD-related laryngospasm, or parasomnias using video-EEG polysomnography and, when indicated, esophageal pH monitoring to avoid misclassification [^11239rSK] [^113yxruu] [^114RceQb].

> Next, I should review first-line management, and I need to ensure I'm aligned with evidence. For all patients, parental education and reassurance are foundational, with counseling on triggers, positioning during spells, and the benign, self-limited course; iron supplementation is the most consistently effective therapy, with randomized and observational data showing marked reductions in spell frequency and even complete resolution in many children, particularly those with iron deficiency or anemia; typical dosing uses elemental iron around 3–5 mg/kg/day for about 3 months, with reassessment of hemoglobin and ferritin to guide continuation [^111NFrWD] [^115SbybP] [^113dQw3X].

> But wait, what if spells persist despite iron or are particularly severe; I should review pharmacologic options. Piracetam has historically been used and may modestly reduce frequency, though comparative data suggest it is less effective than iron or theophylline; theophylline, a methylxanthine with vagolytic and respiratory stimulant effects, has shown substantial reductions in spell frequency in retrospective cohorts; for pallid spells with documented bradycardia or asystole, anticholinergic therapy such as glycopyrrolate may reduce vagal overactivity, and fluoxetine has case-series support for reducing syncope in severe pallid spells, potentially obviating pacing in select patients [^1117hCwZ] [^111pHw7t] [^111FjKys].

> I should confirm when pacing is indicated, because I don't want to over-medicalize. In children with pallid breath-holding spells and documented prolonged asystole (generally ≥ 4 seconds) or severe bradycardia correlating with syncope, especially when refractory to medical therapy, cardiac pacing is reasonable; ACC/AHA/HRS guidance supports pacing in pediatric severe neurally mediated syncope due to pallid breath-holding spells, with series showing high rates of symptom control, and contemporary pediatric device guidelines emphasize correlating symptoms with bradyarrhythmia before implantation [^114Ejnwj] [^117RBXJg] [^115MywzD].

> Let me think about special scenarios so I don't overlook nuances. Nocturnal events labeled as "breath-holding" require targeted testing to distinguish seizures, reflux-related laryngospasm, and parasomnias; vaccine-associated apparent "anaphylaxis" with breath cessation may actually represent a breath-holding spell on rechallenge; and although most cases resolve spontaneously, rare persistence into adolescence has been described, with some authors proposing continuity between pallid spells and vasovagal syncope in older children [^113yxruu] [^114ycVig] [^112CbStC] [^113gqN3t].

> I should double-check prognosis and follow-up so counseling is accurate. The vast majority of children outgrow spells by 4 to 5 years, and even persistent cases generally resolve by 8 years; long-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are not expected in otherwise healthy children, though frequent hypoxic episodes could theoretically pose risks in vulnerable populations; follow-up should track frequency, triggers, and iron status, with ECG monitoring reserved for severe or atypical presentations or when arrhythmia is suspected [^113VRbyL] [^111f912x] [^112Xt5Jj].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Start with clinical diagnosis and screen for red flags; obtain iron studies and treat deficiency; provide education and reassurance; if spells persist or are severe, consider theophylline or piracetam based on shared decision-making; for pallid spells with documented asystole or refractory syncope, escalate to glycopyrrolate or fluoxetine and, in select cases, pursue pacemaker evaluation; throughout, avoid unnecessary EEG unless epilepsy is suspected and tailor testing to atypical features or nocturnal events [^111NFrWD] [^1117hCwZ] [^114Ejnwj] [^112Xt5Jj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought piracetam was the most effective pharmacologic option based on older practice patterns, but I should correct that impression; comparative data suggest theophylline and iron achieve larger reductions in spell frequency than piracetam, so I need to ensure my recommendations reflect that hierarchy while still acknowledging piracetam's acceptable safety and occasional benefit in selected cases [^1117hCwZ] [^111NFrWD].

---

Breath-holding spells are **benign, involuntary episodes** triggered by pain, anger, or frustration, most common in children 6 months to 6 years and resolving spontaneously by school age [^114hvtNW] [^117NUZJj] [^112CbStC]. They present as cyanotic or pallid spells with brief apnea, color change, and possible loss of consciousness; **diagnosis is clinical**, with ECG and iron studies reserved for atypical or severe cases [^117AmEjQ] [^112Xt5Jj] [^114vkVxS]. Management is **supportive and educational**, with iron therapy for deficiency and pacing reserved for severe pallid spells with documented asystole [^111NFrWD] [^114Ejnwj]. Prognosis is excellent, with most children outgrowing spells by age 5–6 and no long-term sequelae [^112CbStC].

---

## Clinical presentation and classification

Breath-holding spells are classified into **two main types** based on clinical features:

| **Type** | **Clinical features** | **Triggers** |
|-|-|-|
| Cyanotic spells | - Blue discoloration (cyanosis) <br/> - Brief apnea <br/> - Loss of consciousness <br/> - Convulsive movements may occur | Emotional distress <br/> Anger <br/> Frustration <br/> Crying [^114PjkGM] |
| Pallid spells | - Pale or ashen discoloration <br/> - Brief apnea <br/> - Loss of consciousness <br/> - Convulsive movements may occur | Sudden fright <br/> Pain <br/> Minor injury [^114PjkGM] |

---

Mixed spells exhibit features of both types within the same episode. Spells typically last **less than one minute**, and children return to baseline shortly after the episode [^114PjkGM].

---

## Epidemiology and natural history

Breath-holding spells are common in early childhood, with a prevalence of approximately 4–5% [^117ATAYW]. The median age of onset is **6–12 months**, peaking at 12–18 months, and most children outgrow spells by school age (4–6 years) [^111f912x]. Persistence beyond age 8 is rare and may warrant further evaluation [^112CbStC].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact pathophysiology is not fully understood; proposed mechanisms include **autonomic dysregulation** with increased vagal tone, leading to bradycardia and cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly in pallid spells [^113VRbyL]. Iron deficiency anemia has been implicated as a contributing factor, especially in cyanotic spells, and is associated with increased frequency and severity [^115SbybP].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on characteristic history and physical examination [^114hvtNW]. Routine laboratory tests are not required for typical cases, but the following evaluations may be considered in atypical or severe cases:

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To exclude cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, particularly in pallid spells or when there is a family history of sudden cardiac death [^1121a6Q2].
- **Iron studies**: Hemoglobin, ferritin, and serum iron levels to assess for iron deficiency anemia, present in approximately 20–30% of cases [^notfound].
- **EEG**: Only if seizures are suspected or spells are atypical, as breath-holding spells are non-epileptic events [^112Xt5Jj].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Breath-holding spells must be differentiated from other causes of transient loss of consciousness in children, including:

- **Seizures**: Particularly absence seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures [^notfound].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Such as prolonged QT syndrome or other conduction abnormalities [^116j7KjL].
- **Syncope**: Vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension [^1121a6Q2].
- **Metabolic disorders**: Hypoglycemia or electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of breath-holding spells is primarily **supportive and educational**, with the following interventions recommended:

- **Parental education**: Reassure parents about the benign nature of spells, provide clear instructions on managing episodes, and avoid reinforcing triggering behaviors [^112CbStC].
- **Iron supplementation**: Recommended for children with iron deficiency anemia, as it significantly reduces the frequency and severity of spells [^111NFrWD].
- **Pharmacological therapy**: Rarely indicated. Piracetam or fluoxetine may be considered in severe, refractory cases, particularly pallid spells associated with autonomic dysfunction [^111FjKys].
- **Cardiac pacing**: Reserved for severe pallid spells with documented prolonged asystole (pauses > 4 seconds) refractory to medical therapy [^114Ejnwj].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for children with breath-holding spells is **excellent**. Most children outgrow spells by school age, and long-term neurological or developmental sequelae are rare. Persistent spells beyond age 8 are uncommon and may require further evaluation [^111f912x] [^116H3fEW].

---

## Parental counseling and education

Parental counseling is essential to manage breath-holding spells effectively. Parents should be educated about the benign nature of spells, common triggers, and appropriate responses during episodes. Emphasis should be placed on **avoiding reinforcement of triggering behaviors** and providing reassurance and support to both the child and family [^notfound].

---

Breath-holding spells are common, benign childhood events characterized by brief apnea, color change, and possible loss of consciousness. They typically resolve spontaneously by school age, and management is primarily supportive, with iron supplementation for iron deficiency and pacing reserved for severe pallid spells with documented asystole.

### Prospective study of children with cyanotic and pallid breath-holding spells [^111f912x]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

In this investigation, we sought to prospectively document the natural history of severe breath-holding spells (BHS) among children with both cyanotic and pallid BHS who were referred for neurologic consultation.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

A structured interview was undertaken at the time of initial consultation and at subsequent 1-year intervals regarding type of BHS, frequency of spells, associated phenomenon, sequelae, family history, and age at termination of spells.

Results

A total of 95 children (48 boys, 47 girls) with BHS were identified and followed over a 9-year interval. There were no significant differences between genders. Median onset age was between 6 and 12 months old with 15% presenting younger than 6 months. A median frequency of spells was weekly with 30% experiencing 1 or more spells per day. The median age at peak frequency was between 12 and 18 months old with a range extending from 6 months to 4 years of age. Of the patients whose BHS had remitted for > 12 months' time (n = 67), the last spell occurred at a median age of 37 to 42 months. Of those children whose BHS were still occurring, the oldest age at time of latest spell was at 7 years old. Hypoxic convulsions were associated with BHS in ≤ 15% of all participants. A positive family history of BHS was identified in 34% of all families with equal frequency distributed between paternal and maternal sides.

Conclusions

In this study, new data concerning the natural history of BHS have been determined. The information is important for family counseling and identifying intervention strategies, and serves as baseline data to evaluate the efficacy of future treatment approaches.

### Persistence of breath-holding spells into late childhood [^112CbStC]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Breath-holding spells commonly occur during infancy. The disorder represents a self-limited, benign phenomenon, and breathholding spells almost always resolve by school age. Their continuing occurrence beyond this age is exceedingly uncommon and may create diagnostic confusion. We recently encountered an 8-year-old boy who continues to experience breath-holding spells.

### Docosahexaenoic acid plus piracetam versus piracetam alone for treatment of breath-holding spells in children: a randomized clinical trial [^116agcfU]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Piracetam is the most widely used drug in breath-holding spells (BHS); however, its efficacy might not be satisfying to parents. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus piracetam with piracetam alone in reducing the frequency and severity of BHS in infants and preschool children.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial included two groups diagnosed with BHS. Group I included 50 patients who received DHA plus piracetam. Group II (control group) included 50 children who were managed with piracetam plus a placebo. Children were re-evaluated at one, three, and six months after treatment. Occurrences of BHS and drug side effects were recorded. The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of the combined treatment of piracetam and DHA on the frequency and severity of spells.

Results

BHS were reported in only 16% of children six months after treatment with piracetam and DHA compared with 50% of those treated with piracetam only (P value = 0.001).

Conclusion

DHA plus piracetam is more effective than piracetam alone in decreasing the frequency and severity of BHS in children.

### Serum soluble transferrin receptor is a valuable diagnostic tool in iron deficiency of breath-holding spells [^114vkVxS]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia may be a factor contributing to breath-holding spells. The serum transferrin receptor provides a useful measure of tissue iron deficiency. In this study of 50 breath-holders, while iron-deficiency anemia was detected in 28 (56%) of patients with routine tests, serum transferrin receptor levels were found increased in all patients. A positive correlation was detected between serum soluble transferrin receptor levels and frequency of attacks. It is suggested that the serum transferrin receptor level is useful as a single test for identification of iron deficiency in breath-holders. Moreover, if iron deficiency can be diagnosed earlier, then patients can be treated earlier.

### Iron deficiency and cyanotic breath-holding spells: the effectiveness of iron therapy [^115SbybP]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim: Frequent cyanotic breath holding spells cause fear and severe anxiety to parents. This study aimed to evaluate clinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics of children with cyanotic breath holding spells. Methods: Included were 180 children (mean age: 1.82 ± 0.53 years) with cyanotic breath holding spells. They were divided into three groups: with iron deficiency, with iron deficiency anemia and without iron deficiency. Blood hemoglobin (HB), ferritin and iron concentrations were measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of iron treatment. Results: The mean spell frequency was 24.57 ± 7.31/months, 83% had spells after the age of 1 year, 37% had daily spells, 16% had family history of spells, and 61% had Iron deficiency/Iron deficiency anemia (p = .001). No significant difference in the frequency of spells between children with iron deficiency and those with Iron deficiency anemia. Compared to patients without iron deficiency, there was significant reduction of spells frequency, increased hemoglobin, ferritin and iron levels after 3 and 6 months of iron therapy (p = .0001). Negative correlations were observed between spell frequency with hemoglobin (p = .001), ferritin (p = .0001) and iron (p = .001) levels. Conclusion: Not only Iron deficiency anemia but also iron deficiency alone without anemia is associated with a risk of high-frequency cyanotic breath holding spells. Iron therapy results in reduction in spells' frequency which was correlated with increasing ferritin and iron levels.

### Treatment of cyanotic breath-holding spells with oral theophylline in a 10-year-old boy [^1126NaYg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Cyanotic breath-holding spells are generally benign and resolve spontaneously by 4 to 5 years of age. Treatment with iron and other drugs has been employed in selected cases with very frequent and severe episodes. We describe a 10-year-old boy with recent-onset cyanotic breath-holding spells that were activity limiting. He was unable to participate in physical activities with his peers as any argument or emotional upset provoked these spells. Treatment with oral iron and piracetam was ineffective. However, treatment with oral theophylline produced dramatic amelioration of symptoms, and he was once again able to participate in play activities with his peers. We believe that general central nervous system stimulant and respirogenic effects of theophylline were instrumental in control of symptoms in our child.

### Adolescent asystolic syncope [^113gqN3t]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

When the etiology of syncope is considered, age is a major parameter. Breath-holding spells are thought of as an entity of early childhood, whereas neurogenic syncope is limited to older children and adults. Both entities, however, involve a similar derangement of the autonomic nervous system. We report an adolescent with a history of breath-holding spells presenting to our institution with neurogenic syncope. Her response to vagal stimulation is consistent with that seen by other investigators in both entities. We propose that pallid breath-holding spells and neurogenic syncope are the same entity.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^117AmEjQ]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric syncope — epidemiology and age-related patterns — shows high prevalence and specific pediatric syndromes, with estimates that by 18 years of age 30% to 50% of children experience at least 1 fainting episode and syncope accounts for 3% of all pediatric ED visits; incidence is higher in females and peaks between 15 to 19 years of age, neurally mediated syncope accounts for 75% of pediatric syncope with psychogenic or unexplained syncope in 8% to 15%, cyanotic breath-holding spells typically occur from age 6 months to age 5 years, pallid breath-holding spells are seen in the first 1 to 2 years of age and may be an early form of VVS, and the latter episodes are associated with significant bradycardia and prolonged asystole.

### Case report of successful treatment of pallid breath-holding spells with glycopyrrolate [^111pHw7t]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Breath-holding spells are a common childhood disorder that typically present before 12 months of age. Whereas most cases are benign, some patients have very severe cases associated with bradycardia that can progress from asystole to syncope and seizures. Treatment studies have implicated the use of several therapies, such as oral iron, fluoxetine, and pacemaker implantation. This is a retrospective study of patients treated with glycopyrrolate for pallid breath-holding spells. Clinical data from 4 patients referred to pediatric cardiology who saw therapeutic benefit from treatment using glycopyrrolate were reviewed to evaluate for clinical response to the drug. Two twin patients, whose symptoms began at 5 months of age, experienced a decrease in breath-holding frequency after 1 month. A patient diagnosed at 7 months of age experienced a decrease in frequency of spells. A patient diagnosed at 10 months of age reported cessation of syncope shortly after initiation of glycopyrrolate and complete resolution of breath-holding spells during prolonged treatment. This case study of 4 patients with pallid breath-holding offers evidence that glycopyrrolate may be beneficial in treating breath-holding spells and has a safer side-effect profile than pacemaker implantation.

### Selenium and antioxidant levels decreased in blood of children with breath-holding spells [^116YXLnU]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that the imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems might be involved in the pathophysiology of breath-holding spells. The aim of this study is to evaluate the oxidant-antioxidant status in children with breath-holding spells compared to healthy children. In a case control study, 67 children with breath-holding spells were compared with 60 healthy children. Malondialdehyde values of the patients were significantly higher than those in control. Levels of selenium, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase of the patient group are significantly lower than those in control. The present study gives helpful data about oxidant-antioxidant systems alterations in breath-holding spells in such a large patient group. These data give support to the hypothesis of the imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, and selenium deficiency might be involved in the pathophysiology of breath-holding spells, suggesting the role of this system dysregulation in breath-holding spells.

### Effectiveness oral theophylline, piracetam, and iron treatments in children with simple breath-holding spells [^1117hCwZ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Breath-holding spells (BHS) are common nonepileptic paroxysmal events in children. This is a retrospective study to compare the effectiveness of oral theophylline, piracetam, and iron treatments in children with simple BHS. A total of 146 children (75 girls and 71 boys) with simple BHS were included to this retrospective study. Children were divided into 4 groups: nontreated (no anemia and no treatment), oral theophylline (10 mg/kg/d as a single daily dose), piracetam (40 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses), and elementary iron (3 mg/kg/d as a single daily dose) treatments. Iron therapy had been given only in children with iron deficiency anemia. Neurologic, cardiologic, and biochemical evaluations were performed for all children. The majority of the patients had cyanotic spells (83.6%). The frequency of attacks/month was markedly decreased with iron (58.8%) and theophylline (82.9%) treatments, but not with piracetam therapy (8.8%) and nontreated group (4.7%). Satisfaction of the parents/caregivers was found to be high in the theophylline group (P < .001). Our results showed that theophylline was the most effective therapy to decrease the frequency of simple BHS in children.

### Effects of iron replacement on electrocardiogram parameters in breath-holding spells patients with iron deficiency [^111bQiA3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to examine electrocardiogram parameters in patients with breath-holding spells accompanied by iron deficiency before iron treatment and after three months of iron supplementation therapy. A total of 195 children were included in the study, consisting of 95 patients with breath-holding spells and 100 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients were evaluated for iron deficiency at admission. Iron deficiency was associated with 48 patients who had breath-holding spells, while it was not associated with 47 of them. When comparing the ECG parameters of patients with breath-holding spells (BHS) and the control group, the QRS and QT intervals were found to be significantly longer in patients with BHS (p < 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of PHR, Pmax, Pd, QTd, QTc, QTcd, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc (p > 0.05). In BHS patients with iron deficiency, QRS, QT, and QTc durations were observed to shorten after iron supplementation therapy, with statistically significant reductions (p = 0.036, p = 0.011, p = 0.008, respectively). Additionally, BHS did not recur in 45.23% of patients who received iron supplementation therapy. Our study found that QRS, QT, and QTc durations shortened following iron supplementation in pediatric patients with BHS and iron deficiency anemia. This highlights the beneficial effects of iron on ventricular depolarization and repolarization parameters. Therefore, ECG parameter evaluation should always be considered in the management of patients with breath-holding spells, particularly those with iron deficiency.

### Laughter is not always funny: breath-holding spells in familial dysautonomia [^111DemfN]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a genetic disease characterized by primary autonomic dysfunction including parasympathetic hypersensitivity. Breath-holding spells (BHS) are believed to be caused by autonomic dysregulation mediated via the vagus nerve and increased in patients with a family history of BHS. Details and understanding of its pathophysiology are lacking. In this retrospective study of patients with FD, the incidence of BHS was higher at 53.3%, compared with previous studies in normal children. Laughter as a precipitating factor for BHS has not been previously reported in FD and occurred in 10% of patients in this study. Lower lung volumes, chronic lung disease, chronic CO2 retention, and inadequate autonomic compensation occur in those with FD leading to a higher incidence and severity of BHS when crying or laughing. Thus, FD may be a good model for understanding manifestations of the autonomic nervous system dysfunction and contribute to our knowledge of BHS mechanisms.

### Effect of piracetam and iron treatment on heart rate variability in patients with breath-holding spell [^117ATAYW]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breath-holding spells are a benign condition primarily seen in 3% to 5% of healthy children aged between six months and five years. Although no specific treatment is recommended due to its benign nature, iron and piracetam are used in severe or recurrent cases. We planned to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) before and after treatment with 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients receiving iron and piracetam treatment and investigate the treatment's effectiveness.

Methods

Twenty-five patients who applied to the outpatient clinic between 2013 and 2015 due to breath-holding spells were included in the study. The patients who received piracetam and iron therapy and underwent 24-hour rhythm Holter monitoring were evaluated retrospectively.

Results

Fourteen (56%) of these patients were evaluated as having cyanotic-type and 11 (44%) patients were assessed as having pale-type breath-holding spells. A significant difference was found only between hourly peak heart rate and total power in the group receiving iron treatment. Significant differences were also found among the minimum heart rate, mean heart rate, the standard deviation of RR intervals, the mean square root of the sum of the squares of their difference between adjacent RR intervals, spectpow, and low frequency before and after the treatment in the patients who started piracetam treatment (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Our study is critical as it is the first to investigate the effects of treatment options on various HRV in patients with breath-holding spells. There were statistically significant changes in HRV parameters in patients receiving piracetam, and the number of attacks decreased significantly. Piracetam treatment contributes positively to the breath-holding spell with regard to efficacy and HRV, therefore it can be used to treat breath-holding spells.

### Parental attitude of mothers, iron deficiency anemia, and breath-holding spells [^116YNV9b]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of family structure and the attitude of mothers on the development of breath-holding spells. The data of the Sociodemographic and Parental Attitude Research Instruments of 30 mothers of children with breath-holding spells and of 30 mothers of healthy children were compared. The subjects were also evaluated for iron deficiency anemia and by age-related developmental test. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in the results of the Sociodemographic and Parental Attitude Research Instruments. Iron deficiency anemia was found to be significantly higher in the group of mothers of children with breath-holding spells compared with the control group. This study suggests that iron deficiency anemia rather than behavioral or psychosocial problems of mothers plays a role in the development of breath-holding spells.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^113yxruu]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden breath-holding episodes during sleep in young children are potentially related to sudden infant death syndrome and other life-threatening events. Additionally, these episodes can negatively affect child's growth and development.

Case Presentation

Here, we present 3 cases of preschool children with similar paroxysmal nocturnal waking events associated with choking that had different etiologies (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease, and parasomnia, respectively).

Conclusions

It is important to take into consideration the fact that breath spells during sleep can occur as a rare manifestation of parasomnia due to gastroesophageal reflux or as a symptom of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Full video electroencephalography, polysomnography, and simultaneous gastric pH monitoring should be used for the differential diagnosis of sleep-related disorders, such as breath spells, in children.

### Effects of iron replacement on electrocardiogram parameters in breath-holding spells patients with iron deficiency [^117NUZJj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breath-holding spells (BHS), which are relatively common during childhood, were first described by Nicholas Culpeper. These episodes are characterized as recurrent and involuntary events, typically precipitated by emotional triggers such as frustration or crying, and are accompanied by changes in skin color. BHS most frequently occurs between the ages of 6 months and 6 years, although cases have been reported up to 8 years of age.

While the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of BHS remain incompletely understood, several contributing factors have been proposed. These include genetic predisposition, emotional stress, parental psychosocial background, imbalance in autonomic nervous system regulation, and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Iron deficiency has been shown to increase irritability and crying in children, potentially predisposing them to BHS episodes. Furthermore, decreased hemoglobin levels in IDA result in reduced tissue oxygenation, which may contribute to cerebral hypoxia and trigger BHS attacks.

Adequate iron stores are also essential for proper autonomic nervous system function. Iron deficiency may disrupt autonomic regulation, potentially leading to subclinical cardiovascular effects in affected children. In particular, abnormalities in ventricular repolarization and atrial conduction have been reported in children with BHS. Prolongation of the QT interval and the associated risk of ventricular arrhythmias are major clinical concerns, given their association with increased morbidity and potential mortality.

Several studies have demonstrated subclinical cardiac involvement in children with BHS, including QTc prolongation, repolarization abnormalities, and arrhythmias, as well as evidence of autonomic imbalance. These findings underscore that BHS may not be entirely benign and highlight the importance of ECG evaluation in affected children. Establishing whether iron supplementation can favorably modify these ECG parameters provides a strong rationale for the present study.

These considerations highlight the importance of electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation in children with BHS, particularly those presenting with frequent or cyanotic episodes.

Although prior studies have examined the relationship between iron deficiency and BHS frequency or severity, there is a paucity of research focusing on the effects of iron supplementation on ECG parameters in this population.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in ECG findings before and after iron supplementation therapy in pediatric patients with BHS and IDA, and to compare these results with those of children without iron deficiency and with healthy controls.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^112KCDAg]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden breath-holding episodes during sleep in young children are potentially related to sudden infant death syndrome and other life-threatening events. Additionally, these episodes can negatively affect child's growth and development.

Case presentation

Here, we present 3 cases of preschool children with similar paroxysmal nocturnal waking events associated with choking that had different etiologies (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease, and parasomnia, respectively).

Conclusions

It is important to take into consideration the fact that breath spells during sleep can occur as a rare manifestation of parasomnia due to gastroesophageal reflux or as a symptom of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Full video electroencephalography, polysomnography, and simultaneous gastric pH monitoring should be used for the differential diagnosis of sleep-related disorders, such as breath spells, in children.

### The utilization of an insertable cardiac monitor in a child with pallid breath-holding spells [^1146b1Ht]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pacing can be a successful treatment for pallid breath-holding spells, primarily in individuals with severe bradycardia.

Patient Description

We describe an 18-month-old girl experiencing severe pallid breath-holding spells in whom repeated electrocardiographic, Holter, and electroencephalographic monitoring tests were all normal.

Results

Using a subcutaneous insertable cardiac monitor, severe bradycardia was detected during one of this girl's episodes. This finding led to a pacemaker implantation. Subsequently, her breath-holding spells completely resolved.

Conclusion

This child illustrates the ability of the insertable cardiac monitor to help and diagnose arrhythmias in children with unresolved clinical findings. The ability to implant it with a minimal scar makes it ideal for uncooperative individuals with relative few and unexpected episodes that are hard to diagnose.

### Breath-holding spells associated with significant bradycardia: successful treatment with permanent pacemaker implantation [^114DXYbA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether children with pallid breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia can be treated safely and successfully with permanent pacemaker implantation.

Methods

The records of pediatric patients who had apparent breath-holding spells and associated bradycardia and were treated with permanent pacemaker implantation were reviewed.

Results

Ten pediatric patients with apparent breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia were treated with a permanent ventricular demand pacemaker at the Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1995. Patients had onset of symptoms between ages 6 days and 12 months and presented for evaluation between ages 12 months and 5 years. Duration of spells was 15 seconds to 10 minutes. Medications to prevent spells were unsuccessful. Electrocardiograms documented asystolic pauses of 1.7 to 24 seconds (mean: 11.9 seconds). Permanent ventricular demand pacemakers were implanted at 10 months to 5 years of age (median: 14.5 months): 9 endocardial and 1 epicardial. Three patients required pacemaker revision. At follow-up of 38 to 170 months (median: 65.5), 5 patients had complete resolution of spells, 2 had only mild color change without loss of consciousness or seizure activity, and 3 continued to have minor brief spells.

Conclusions

Permanent pacemaker therapy for children with pallid breath-holding spells associated with severe bradycardia is safe, efficacious, and warranted.

### Fatal case of acute epidural hematoma in an infant with concurrent breath-holding spells [^114Zpxsx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The coexistence of acute epidural hematoma and breath-holding spells (BHS) is infrequently encountered in clinical settings. This report presents a rare case of an infant who developed both conditions concurrently, resulting in fatality.

Case Presentation

A female infant, aged 4 months and 25 days, presented to the emergency department with persistent vomiting for 15 hours and loss of consciousness for 5 hours. Computed tomography of the head indicated a substantial epidural hematoma involving the left frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The patient was promptly admitted to the intensive care unit for resuscitative measures and surgical preparation. Emergency decompressive surgery was performed, and postoperative supportive management, including fluid resuscitation and antimicrobial therapy, was initiated. Postoperatively, the infant demonstrated clinical improvement sufficient for ventilator weaning. However, cardiac arrest occurred within one minute of extubation. Despite immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient did not survive.

Conclusions

The concurrence of acute epidural hematoma and breath-holding spells is a rare and potentially fatal clinical entity in infants. Mortality related to BHS remains uncommon. Early recognition, comprehensive parental education, prompt multidisciplinary intervention, and heightened clinical awareness are essential for improving prognoses in pediatric patients presenting with craniocerebral trauma complicated by BHS.

### Changes of autonomic nervous system function in patients with breath-holding spells treated with iron [^114pAVtw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the autonomic nervous system of patients with breath-holding spells after iron treatment, we attempted to determine whether a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system reflexes exists in children with severe cyanotic breathholding spells. An electrocardiogram for each subject was recorded for 24 hours in the subject's home and parasympathetic activity was investigated by the fast Fourier transform method. Hematologic data and clinical symptoms of all three patients treated with iron improved and attacks of severe breath-holding spells disappeared. After iron treatment was started, the heart rate variability increased during sleep. It appears that supplementation of iron is effective in improving the dysregulation of autonomic nervous system reflexes.

### Effects of iron replacement on electrocardiogram parameters in breath-holding spells patients with iron deficiency [^116hBJi7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that children with BHS and IDA exhibit subtle but significant prolongation of QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, which improve following iron supplementation. These findings suggest a reversible effect of iron on cardiac conduction and repolarization, with potential implications for arrhythmia risk. Routine ECG monitoring may therefore be warranted in BHS patients with IDA, and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm and extend these observations.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^114wXvjh]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, breath-holding episodes during sleep should be differentiated from nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders. When diagnosing nocturnal episodes, it is important to take into consideration the fact that sleep-related choking syndrome and laryngospasm associated with GER may appear in the absence of other GERD symptoms. PSG is an essential tool for the evaluation of sleep abnormalities; however, PSG alone is not useful for the differentiation of nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders in children. Therefore, PSG with full-montage video-EEG and simultaneous 24-h pH monitoring are important adjunct tools for the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms, such as breath spells, choking, and sudden coughing during sleep.

### Clinical diagnosis of syncopes (including so-called breath-holding spells) without electroencephalography or ocular compression [^112Xt5Jj]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

A recent article in this journal suggested that ocular compression during electroencephalography was useful in distinguishing "breath-holding spells and syncope" from epileptic seizures. The method proposed involved measurement of the RR interval on the simultaneously recorded electrocardiographic trace and determining both the absolute RR lengthening and the change in RR interval as compared with the baseline value. It is argued by the present author that this is not an appropriate way to come to a diagnosis in episodic loss of consciousness in children. It is pointed out that so-called "breath-holding spells" are reflex syncopes and that the diagnosis of reflex syncopes should be by clinical history, even if this means delaying the diagnosis until a future consultation. Published evidence on the nature and clinical diagnosis of reflex syncopes in infants and children is reviewed in depth. It is concluded that routine electroencephalography is not an appropriate investigation when the diagnosis of episodic loss of consciousness is in doubt and has the implicit danger of false positive "abnormality". Aside from scientific exploration of the developing autonomic nervous system, the only current indication for diagnostic ocular compression is to induce a syncope so that its nature may be better understood. Such a circumstance might be a history of an apparent reflex syncope but with atypical features, including prolonged post-syncopal unconsciousness such as might indicate epileptic absence status. Several additional investigations of a primarily cardiological nature may be indicated in some cases, but a wait-and-see policy is usually to be preferred.

### Glycopyrrolate and theophylline for the treatment of severe pallid breath-holding spells [^115wkbER]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Severe pallid breath-holding spells (BHSs) are based on parasympathetic hyperactivity, leading to cardiac asystole, pallor, brain ischemia, loss of consciousness, and reflex anoxic seizures. In recent years, an increasing number of patients with severe pallid BHSs have been successfully treated with pacemaker implantation. We present the case of a 13-month-old girl suffering from repeated severe pallid BHSs, causing asystole, loss of consciousness, and generalized anoxic seizures. She underwent treatment with oral glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic drug, and an oral retard preparation of theophylline. The aim of the treatment was to decrease cardiac inhibition with glycopyrrolate and to bring about a positive chronotropic effect with theophylline. In our case, the combined therapy was effective in suppressing syncope and reflex anoxic seizures associated with BHSs This avoided the need for ventricular pacemaker implantation.

### Successful treatment of pallid breath-holding spells with fluoxetine [^111FjKys]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Pallid breath-holding (PBH) is a childhood condition that presents with recurrent syncope. Although typically benign, severe cases can lead to asystole and anoxic seizures. Previous studies have advocated pacemaker placement to abbreviate symptoms. This was a retrospective study of patients treated with fluoxetine for PBH spells. Clinical response, side effects and avoidance of pacemaker implantation were reviewed in six patients (12–60 months) treated with fluoxetine for PBH. Patients were referred because of concern of arrhythmia and failed medical treatment strategies. Two patients had previously implanted loop recorders, 5 patients had documented episodes of asystole, and 2 patients had generalized seizures. Fluoxetine resulted in alleviation of syncope in 5 of 6 patients. Time to symptomatic improvement symptoms ranged from 2 days to 1 month (median, 2 weeks). Median duration of treatment with fluoxetine was 12 months (12–24 months). One patient demonstrated no improvement and had a pacemaker implanted. There were no reported side effects to fluoxetine. Fluoxetine can be used to treat childhood PBH spells and may obviate the need for permanent pacing in a significant subset of this population. Considering its safe side-effect profile it is a worthwhile first-line agent to treat this disorder.

Pediatric syncope — epidemiology and distinguishing entities: By 18 years of age, it is estimated that 30% to 50% of children experience at least 1 fainting episode, and syncope accounts for 3% of all pediatric ED visits; the incidence is higher in females and peaks between 15 to 19 years of age. Neurally mediated syncope accounts for 75% of pediatric syncope, followed by psychogenic or unexplained syncope in 8% to 15% of cases. Breath‑holding spells are unique to pediatrics: cyanotic breath‑holding spells typically occur from age 6 months to age 5 years, whereas pallid breath‑holding spells are seen in the first 1 to 2 years of age, may be an early form of VVS, and the latter episodes are associated with significant bradycardia and prolonged asystole. Pediatric cardiac syncope may result from obstruction to blood flow, myocardial dysfunction, congenital coronary anomaly, post–Kawasaki disease, or primary arrhythmic etiologies including LQTS, CPVT, Brugada syndrome, ARVC, or Wolff‑Parkinson‑White syndrome; a detailed history and physical examination can guide practitioners in differentiating life‑threatening from more benign neurally mediated syncope, and a detailed family history focused on premature SCD in first‑ and second‑degree relatives is helpful. Interventions recommended for adults with similar conditions presenting with syncope can be applied in children.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^114RceQb]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we described 3 cases of childhood nocturnal breath-holding episodes, each related to a different diagnosis. A major conclusion of this report is that the differential diagnosis for paroxysmal breath-holding spells during sleep should consider nocturnal seizures and sleep disorders, such as parasomnia, sleep-related laryngospasm associated with GERD, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Insufficient or lack of sleep is a common trigger factor for developing seizures and epileptiform discharges on EEG. Children with epilepsy commonly complain of sleep disturbances, including nighttime awakening, particularly when seizures are poorly controlled. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are a few more common epileptic syndromes that present with nocturnal seizures.

Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is characterized by various motor behaviors during sleep, including pedaling movement of the limbs, dystonic posturing, and tremors after sudden arousal. Because the interictal EEGs are usually normal in cases with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, the differentiation of this disorder from partial arousal parasomnias or sleep-related movement disorders may be difficult when the nocturnal symptoms are nonspecific.

Benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is characterized by partial seizures with sensorimotor symptoms of the face and oropharynx, hemiconvulsions, and tonic-clonic seizures during NREM sleep. Seizures usually occur on a nightly basis during sleep or upon awakening.

When nocturnal seizures are eliminated as a diagnostic possibility, the suggested differential diagnosis includes sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm, which can be associated with GER during sleep. Although GER commonly occurs in infants and resolves with age, the persistence of nocturnal GERD is a known cause of sleep disturbances in children. Sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm has been described in the diagnostic and coding manual of the American Sleep Disorder Association as a dramatic attack that produces breathing difficulties, awakening, stridor, apnea, fear, and agitation that typically resolves within 1–3 min. Reflux-induced apnea affects approximately 1% of infants and is related to airway closure or laryngospasm. Recently, GER studies have revealed that weak acid reflux during the nighttime occurs more frequently than was previously considered and may trigger nocturnal episodes of laryngospasm. The extreme reported cases of laryngospasm related to GERD include Sandifer syndrome, sleep-related laryngospasm, refractory asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Sandifer syndrome is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy and is characterized by the head rotation and tonic posture. Manifestations of this syndrome typically occur in the postprandial period.

Pediatric severe neurally mediated syncope secondary to pallid breath-holding spells — cardiac pacing may be considered (IIb B-NR); in 2 studies of 22 predominantly infants and toddlers with documented prolonged asystole (pauses > 4 seconds), 86% had either complete resolution or a significant reduction in syncopal events with pacing, and either single- or dual-chamber pacing significantly reduced syncopal episodes compared with a sensing-only strategy.

### Brief breath holding may confound functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [^113rSt6u]. Human Brain Mapping (2005). Low credibility.

We demonstrate that breath holding of short durations may confound functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Some subjects may hold their breath for a short time during task performance, especially if the task is challenging. Breath holding may therefore need to be considered specifically when interpreting fMRI experiments. We studied the temporal and spatial characteristics of cerebral T2✱-weighted signal during short periods of breath holding by seven individuals in a 3-tesla MR scanner. We demonstrate that breath-holds as short as 3 s can result in regions of significant cerebral activation. More interestingly, we show that focal activation remains present when the data is analysed in a number of different ways, including analyses that correct for motion and model the task epoch as if it were 10 times longer than the actual breath-hold length. These findings have potential relevance for many researchers carrying out fMRI studies.

### Usefulness of ocular compression during electroencephalography in distinguishing breath-holding spells and syncope from epileptic seizures [^111ohZoJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Episodes of syncope or breath-holding spells are often misdiagnosed as epileptic events. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of an electroencephalogram (EEG) with ocular compression to distinguish breath-holding spells and syncope from epileptic seizures. A retrospective analysis was performed on the EEG records of all children on whom ocular compression was performed from 2000 to 2003. Data from 116 patients with a clinical diagnosis consistent with either syncope or breath-holding spells were compared with a group of 46 patients with epilepsy. The RR interval during ocular compression was significantly higher in syncope patients compared with patients with epilepsy (P < .005). Using 2 seconds of asystole as the cutoff, the sensitivity of ocular compression was 26%, with 100% specificity. The change in RR interval from baseline to ocular compression also distinguished patients with breath-holding spells and syncope from patients with epilepsy. Even a small increase of 0.5 seconds in the RR interval demonstrated a sensitivity of 46%, with a specificity of 98%. Ocular compression performed during an EEG is useful in distinguishing patients with breath-holding spells and syncope from those with epileptic seizures. A requirement of a 2-second period of asystole with ocular compression excludes many patients. Our data indicate that an RR interval increase of 0.5 seconds over baseline identifies additional patients with increased vagal tone. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of the etiology of loss of consciousness might preclude the need for further extensive and expensive evaluation and reduce patient and parental distress.

In addition, we aim to highlight the need for further research in specific patient groups. This report also reviews considerations for equipment, staff training and patient coaching, as well as image guidance for breath-hold treatments. Dedicated sections for specific indications, namely breast cancer, thoracic and abdominal tumours are also included.

Materials and methods

Study design and population

This prospective observational study was conducted at the Pediatric Cardiology Outpatient Clinic of Manisa Celal Bayar University (MCBU) Hospital between June 2022 and July 2023. A total of 95 children aged 6 months to 8 years who presented with episodes initially diagnosed as seizure, convulsion, or syncope were screened. Patients were included if clinical history and presentation were consistent with breath-holding spells (BHS), defined as:

An event triggered by crying or frustration,
A brief change in consciousness and postural tone,
Associated with changes in skin color (cyanosis, pallor, or mixed),
With spontaneous recovery and no postictal confusion,
In the absence of structural heart disease, epilepsy, or metabolic disorder.

Classification of spell subtypes

BHS cases were further classified into cyanotic, pallid, or mixed subtypes according to established clinical criteria:

Cyanotic spells were defined as episodes typically precipitated by emotional stimuli such as anger, frustration, or crying, followed by a period of expiratory apnea, cyanosis, and transient loss of consciousness.
Pallid spells were defined as events often triggered by minor injury or sudden fright, characterized by pallor, brief loss of consciousness, and bradycardia, usually without preceding crying.
Mixed spells were defined as episodes in which features of both cyanotic and pallid spells occurred within the same event.

Children whose parents consented to participation were enrolled. At admission, all patients were evaluated for iron deficiency using laboratory testing. Of these, 48 patients were diagnosed with iron deficiency and 47 had normal iron profiles. Iron deficiency was defined as hemoglobin below − 2 SD for age, serum iron and ferritin below reference thresholds, and elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Reference intervals used were: Serum iron: 60–180 µg/dL, Ferritin: 11–306 ng/mL, TIBC: 250–450 µg/dL, Iron-binding capacity (IBC): 155–300 µg/dL. Patients whose values fell below or above these ranges were categorized accordingly.

Control group

A control group of 100 age-matched children was recruited from the same clinic over the same period. These children presented for reasons unrelated to syncope (e.g. chest pain, innocent murmur), had normal ECGs and iron profiles, no known cardiac or neurological disease, and no history of breath-holding spells, seizure, or syncope.

### Iron supplementation for breath-holding attacks in children [^111NFrWD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breath-holding attacks are common during childhood. Iron supplementation has been claimed to reduce the frequency or severity, or both, of breath-holding attacks in children.

Objectives

To assess the effect of iron supplementation on the frequency and severity of breath-holding attacks in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (up to April 2009). We scanned references of included trials. Pharmaceutical companies manufacturing oral iron supplements and some trial authors were contacted for any unpublished data or trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing iron supplementation with placebo or no therapy in children < 18 years with recurrent (more than three) breath-holding episodes. These were reported by an observer.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was reduction in the frequency (number over time) or severity (leading to cessation of loss of consciousness or convulsive movements), or both, of breath-holding attacks. Two authors (AZ and NO) independently selected studies and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for missing data, where necessary. Risk of bias was assessed using domain-based evaluation. In the presence of low heterogeneity, a fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed with pooled results presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

Two trials (87 children) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In these trials, iron supplementation significantly reduced the frequency of breath-holding attacks in children (OR 76.48; 95% CI 15.65 to 373.72; P < 0.00001). A meta-analysis that solely examined iron supplementation causing complete resolution of breath-holding attacks maintained this significance (OR 53.43; 95% CI 6.57 to 434.57; P = 0.0002).

Authors' Conclusions

Iron supplementation (at 5 mg/kg/day of elemental iron for 16 weeks) appears to be useful in reducing the frequency and severity of breath-holding attacks. Supplementation is of particular benefit in children with iron deficiency anaemia, responses correlating with the improvements in haemoglobin values. Iron may still be of assistance in children who are not anaemic or who have low, normal haemoglobin levels. Further high-quality randomised control trials of iron supplementation to treat breath-holding attacks in children are required.

SD Standard deviation

Of the 48 BHS patients with iron deficiency, 6 were lost to follow-up after initiation of oral iron therapy (4 mg/kg/day for 3 months) and were excluded from outcome analysis. These patients did not differ significantly from those who completed follow-up in terms of age, sex, or baseline ECG findings.

Among the 42 patients who completed treatment, 19 patients (45.2%) experienced complete resolution of BHS, while 23 (54.8%) continued to exhibit spells [15 (%68) cyanotic, 4 (%16) pallid, 4 (%16) mixed] (Percentages are based on the n = 42 who completed follow-up.)

Electrocardiographic findings are summarized in Table 3. Compared with controls, patients with BHS demonstrated significantly prolonged QRS and QT intervals (p < 0.05). Other ECG parameters including PHR, Pmax, Pd, QTd, QTc, QTcd, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05).

Other ECG parameters remained unchanged post-treatment (p > 0.05).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Pacing in children, adolescents, and congenital heart disease — Indications emphasize symptom correlation and specific thresholds. The document states that the most common indications for implantation "may be classified as 1) symptomatic sinus bradycardia, 2) the bradycardia-tachycardia syndromes, and 3) advanced second- or third-degree AV block, either congenital or postsurgical". Age context is provided as "adolescents (defined as less than 19 years of age)". Physiologic variability is noted: "whereas a heart rate of 45 bpm may be a normal finding in an adolescent, the same rate in a newborn or infant indicates profound bradycardia". Importantly, "it is not itself an indication for pacemaker implantation" for SND, and "the primary criterion for pacemaker implantation is the concurrent observation of a symptom… with bradycardia (e.g., heart rate less than 40 bpm or asystole more than 3 seconds)". The guideline adds that "Symptomatic bradycardia is an indication for pacemaker implantation provided that other causes have been excluded", and that pacing "has been effective in the prevention of recurrent seizures and syncope in infants with recurrent pallid breath-holding spells associated with profound bradycardia or asystole". For post–congenital surgery intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia with drug-induced bradycardia, "radiofrequency catheter ablation… should be considered as an alternative to combined pharmacological and pacemaker therapies".

Results

A total of 95 patients diagnosed with BHS and 100 age-matched controls without BHS or iron deficiency were included. Among BHS patients, 49 (51.6%) were female and 46 (48.4%) male; in the control group, 50 (50%) were female and 50 (50%) male. The mean age was 21.62 ± 14.4 months in the overall BHS group, 22.91 ± 16.19 months in the BHS + iron deficiency subgroup, 20.29 ± 12.33 months in the BHS without iron deficiency subgroup, and 19.29 ± 9.66 months in the control group. No significant differences were found between BHS and control groups regarding age, gender, height, or weight (p > 0.05). Key socio-demographic features are summarized in Table 1.

### Sudden death in lesch-nyhan disease [^117FnPxp]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To increase awareness of sudden and unexpected death in Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) and to explore its potential causes, we report the anteceding clinical features and laboratory evaluations of five males with LND who ultimately experienced sudden and unexpected death, along with three additional males who suffered serious respiratory events during life. The ages of patients ranged from 2 to 45 years. The cause of sudden death in LND appears to have a respiratory rather than a cardiogenic basis. All cases cannot be linked readily with a single respiratory process. Instead, different respiratory processes appear to operate in different cases. These may include aspiration, laryngospasm, central apnea, cyanotic breath-holding spells, and high cervical spine damage. Better recognition of these processes will help to guide appropriate workup and management that could include chest imaging, endoscopy of the airways, polysomnography, electroencephalogram, and brain and/or spine imaging.

### Case report of vaccine-induced anaphylactic reaction reclassified after vaccine challenge [^114ycVig]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

At age 4 months, an infant had skin changes and cessation of breathing responsive to epinephrine after vaccine administration. The atypical breathing recurred during vaccine challenge but was consistent with breath-holding spell rather than anaphylaxis. Vaccine challenges can be performed in appropriate settings even when cases are consistent with anaphylaxis.

### Effects of iron replacement on electrocardiogram parameters in breath-holding spells patients with iron deficiency [^114v53it]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated ECG changes in children with BHS, particularly in those with concurrent IDA, and examined the potential reversibility of these changes following iron supplementation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated ECG parameters in children with BHS associated with iron deficiency before and after iron therapy. Therefore, direct comparisons with existing literature were not possible, underscoring the originality and novelty of our study.

Among the 48 patients diagnosed with iron deficiency and BHS, 42 completed three months of oral iron therapy. Following treatment, 19 (45.2%) patients achieved complete remission of spells. This clinical improvement aligns with previous reports demonstrating reduced BHS frequency after iron supplementation.

When comparing ECG parameters before and after treatment in patients with IDA-associated BHS, we observed a statistically significant shortening in QRS, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) durations (p = 0.036, p = 0.011, and p = 0.008, respectively). These findings suggest that iron plays a favorable role in cardiac conduction and ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT intervals have been associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, thus the improvement observed may reflect reduced arrhythmic potential post-treatment.

Consistent with our results, studies by Akalın et al. and DiMario et al. reported prolonged QT intervals in children with BHS compared to controls. Additionally, anemia has been shown to affect ventricular repolarization markers, including QT and QRS duration. Our finding that QRS duration shortened after iron supplementation supports the hypothesis that iron improves myocardial electrophysiologic properties in this population.

Although QRS duration was statistically longer in the BHS group compared to controls, it remained within age-specific normal limits. This suggests that the observed difference, while significant, may not reflect overt conduction pathology. Similar findings have been noted in other pediatric studies evaluating anemia-related ECG changes.

In contrast to some reports, we found no significant difference in QTd, QTcd, or Tp-e interval between BHS patients and healthy controls. These parameters did not significantly change after treatment either. Variability in findings across studies may stem from differences in patient selection, anemia severity, or underlying autonomic dysfunction.

Statistical analysis

Statistical data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). In descriptive analyses, nominal variables are represented by number and percentage, and continuous variables are represented by mean and standard deviation. The suitability of continuous data for normal distribution was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. In analytical analyses, paired t-test (t-test in dependent groups) was used to compare two consecutive measurements in dependent groups, Wilcoxon signed rank test when parametric conditions were not met, Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables in independent groups, Student's t-test was used to compare the measurement values of two independent groups, Mann Whitney U test was used in nonparametric conditions, ANOVA test was used to compare the mean of the measurement values of more than two groups, and Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used in nonparametric conditions. In the analytical analyses, type 1 error was accepted as 0.05. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^114LbrsD]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Parasomnia often manifests during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Although the exact pathophysiology of parasomnia remains unclear, it is considered a multifactorial disease that is related to an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Sleep talking, sleep walking, and confusional arousals are common symptoms of parasomnia in childhood. Regular and adequate sleep routines, as well as good sleep hygiene are suggested for the management of parasomnia in young children. Medications, including benzodiazepines, are considered dangerous for these patients and are unadvised for the treatment of parasomnia. Thus, care should be taken to differentiate the parasomnia from organic disease states, such as nocturnal seizures and GERD.

PSG is a standard method for the diagnosis of sleep disorders; however, the standard PSG alone does not allow the differentiation of nocturnal seizures from other sleep disorders. PSG with full-montage of video-EEG is superior to standard PSG for the evaluation of nocturnal spells, because of an increased capacity for the identification and localization of EEG abnormalities and the ability to correlate patient behavior with EEG and PSG data. Esophageal pH probe monitoring combined with cardio-respiratory monitoring using nasal airflow for the detection of obstructive apnea has been used to clarify temporal associations between the reflux and apnea. Moreover, a careful collection and examination of patient's medical history is helpful for the diagnosis of sleep apnea (e.g. noting daytime nausea or vomiting when the child is in a supine or seated position after feeding, as signs of airway obstruction in tandem with these symptoms may indicate the involvement of GER). Thus, 24-h pH monitoring with simultaneous PSG with full-montage of video-EEG is an ideal modality for the diagnosis of nocturnal breath-holding events, especially in young patients.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^111SCSNW]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden breath-holding and cyanotic events during sleep are known to cause health complications in young children. These episodes can be frightening and cause intense hypnophobia. Frequent nighttime awakening can also have detrimental effects on child's growth and development, as well as adversely affect the health of the entire family. The burden of caring for affected children can decrease family's productivity, increase the incidence of family conflict-related stress, and even lead to maternal depression. Thus, the early diagnosis and management of nocturnal breath-holding episodes are critical for maintaining the quality of life of both the affected child and family.

A variety of conditions can cause nocturnal waking episodes in childhood. Frequent nocturnal insomnias can be related to an acute medical condition, such as otitis media, sleep-onset association disorders caused by a lack of sleep training, such as childhood behavioral insomnia, primary sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breath disorder, or partial arousal parasomnias, such as night terrors and confusional arousals.

Paroxysmal nocturnal events are commonly misdiagnosed as epilepsy. However, nocturnal epilepsy and parasomnias are distinct causes of breath-holding during sleep that should be differentiated. In addition, laryngospasm is a rare cause of abrupt breath-holding during sleep that is caused by involuntary muscular contraction of the laryngeal cords. Extraesophageal manifestations of the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are a known cause of laryngospasm.

Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard method for the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Alternatively, video electroencephalography (EEG) can provide useful diagnostic information in individuals with a history of prominent motor activity during sleep. However, the isolated use of these tools is often insufficient for the correct diagnosis of nocturnal events.

In this report, we present three cases of preschool-aged children who had similar symptoms (i.e. multiple abrupt waking with choking episodes every night), but received different diagnoses based on PSG with full-montage of video-EEG, as well as 24-h esophageal pH monitoring.

### Loss of consciousness in the young child [^11239rSK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the very young child (less than eight years of age), transient loss of consciousness represents a diagnostic and management dilemma for clinicians. While most commonly benign, syncope may be due to cardiac dysfunction which can be life-threatening. It can be secondary to an underlying ion channelopathy, cardiac inflammation, cardiac ischemia, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension. Patients with genetic disorders require careful evaluation for a cardiac cause of syncope. Among the noncardiac causes, vasovagal syncope is the most common etiology. Breath-holding spells are commonly seen in this age group. Other causes of transient loss of consciousness include seizures, neurovascular pathology, head trauma, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and factitious disorder imposed on another and other forms of child abuse. A detailed social, present, past medical, and family medical history is important when evaluating loss of consciousness in the very young. Concerning characteristics of syncope include lack of prodromal symptoms, no preceding postural changes or occurring in a supine position, after exertion or a loud noise. A family history of sudden unexplained death, ion channelopathy, cardiomyopathy, or congenital deafness merits further evaluation. Due to inherent challenges in diagnosis at this age, often there is a lower threshold for referral to a specialist.

### Effects of iron replacement on electrocardiogram parameters in breath-holding spells patients with iron deficiency [^112aebLn]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pd, a marker of atrial conduction heterogeneity and predictor of atrial arrhythmias, was evaluated but showed no significant differences between groups or after treatment, consistent with some previous pediatric reports, though others have noted increased Pd in BHS or IDA populations. Regarding repolarization heterogeneity, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios were likewise not significantly altered, suggesting a limited role for these markers in iron-related modulation despite occasional reports of elevation in BHS.

A study by Karadeniz et al. found that low ferritin levels in healthy children were associated with prolongation of QT, QTc, and Tp-e intervals, and recommended ECG monitoring in such cases. Our study supports this recommendation, particularly in children with frequent or severe BHS episodes and coexisting iron deficiency.

Limitations

The most important limitation of our study was the lack of long-term follow-up, which prevented the evaluation of delayed or persistent ECG abnormalities and arrhythmias. Additionally, 24-hour Holter monitoring was not performed, which could have enhanced the detection of subclinical or paroxysmal arrhythmias and provided a more robust correlation with standard ECG parameters.

Furthermore, although autonomic dysregulation is considered a potential mechanism in BHS, objective assessment of autonomic function — such as heart rate variability analysis — was not included.

All ECG measurements were performed by a single trained observer to minimize variability; however, inter-observer variability was not assessed, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Lastly, the cross-sectional design of the study limits the ability to infer temporal relationships or establish causality between iron supplementation and ECG changes. Future prospective longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms more comprehensively.

### Case report of vaccine-induced anaphylactic reaction reclassified after vaccine challenge [^112HaMiY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

The patient was given a combined DTaP vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, and combined inactivated polio vaccine (PEDIARIX) administered intramuscularly in a separate visit to the high-risk allergy clinic because the latter was the vaccine most likely to trigger an anaphylactic reaction. The patient tolerated administration of this vaccine when it was given in conjunction with bottle feeding. At this stage, the patient was cleared to receive future vaccines at her pediatrician's office, with the recommendation that she have bottles or other distractions for future vaccinations to lessen the chance of similar reactions.

Initially, the patient appeared to meet the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis owing to cessation of breath and skin findings, although the criteria for respiratory involvement would technically require wheeze, stridor, airway angioedema, or 2 alternate signs of respiratory distress. No measurement of acute tryptase level was available to help confirm the diagnosis. Rechallenge resulted in a cessation of breathing very similar to the initial reaction but without apparent skin changes. Because sudden cessation of breathing without other signs is not a manifestation of anaphylaxis, we did not treat the reaction, which resolved after sleep. We made a presumptive diagnosis of a breath-holding spell (BHS).

BHSs are a common phenomenon among children, typically occurring in those younger than 12 months, and they usually resolve by age 8 years.BHS events are involuntary, with mild cases involving noiseless expiration and color change, whereas severe cases involve loss of consciousness. There is typically an inciting event such as pain or anger, sometimes followed by a brief period of vocalized crying, which gives way to noiseless expiration. This may be followed by a color change and deepening cyanotic or pallor (or both) and, in severe cases, a lack of consciousness. This may be followed by jerking of the child's body and urinary incontinence. The BHS episode ends with resumption of breathing. The diagnosis of BHS does not explain the redness or papular rash that appeared on the patient's face and resolved with epinephrine during the index event; cyanosis or pallor are more common. However, it was the cessation of breathing that alarmed the family and physician team sufficiently for epinephrine administration, and it was replication of this cessation of breathing with readministration of vaccines that led to this presumptive diagnosis.

We attempted a third diagnostic session of PSG with full-montage of video-EEG and simultaneous 24-h gastric pH monitoring in order to exclude the possibility of GERD. Out of 6 choking episodes, 4 were associated with low-amplitude 13–14 Hz fast activities in the right or left frontal areas (Fz, F3, F4) that evolved into medium-to-high-amplitude bi-frontal sharp wave discharges intermixed with 6–7 Hz activities in the posterior cerebral region. Accompanying obscuring muscle artifacts were observed and presented as sudden eye opening and right arm tonicity, followed by breath-holding with or without agitation and gagging (Fig. 1a, b). Several low pH (< 4) events were observed on simultaneous 24-h pH monitoring; however, these episodes did not coincide with the nocturnal breath-holding spells. The patient was diagnosed with frontal lobe epilepsy and experienced complete resolution of her nocturnal symptoms after intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg of sodium valproate, and then, the patient was prescribed oral valproate (Depakoke15mg/kg/day, twice a day). 1 month later, the patient had added topiramate. On follow up until 1 year after, it had been reported that the patient's symptoms were well controlled with only sporadic manifestation of nocturnal episodes.

### Performance of a tracheostomy removal protocol for pediatric patients in rehabilitation after acquired brain injury: factors associated with timing and possibility of decannulation [^116EmTud]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We assessed the performance of a tracheostomy decannulation protocol privileging safety over quickness, in pediatric patients undergoing rehabilitation from severe acquired brain injury. We analyzed factors associated with decannulation timing and possibility and examined cases of failure.

Hypothesis

A safe decannulation protocol should minimize failures.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study.

Patient Selection

Patients aged 0–17 admitted to rehabilitation with tracheostomy in the last 15 years (n = 123).

Methodology

We collected data on clinical and respiratory conditions at admittance, during the first rehabilitation stay and following follow-up controls. We described the sample and tested associations of several factors with the possibility to decannulate patients during either the first stay or follow-up. We described failures, defined as the cases in which tracheostomy tube had to be placed back immediately or after less than 1 month from removal.

Results

At admittance, 93.5% patients were dysphagic and 37.9% had respiratory complications (mainly accumulation of supraglottic secretions). At first discharge, dysphagia was reduced (62.1%) and respiratory complications increased (41.1%). Tracheostomy was removed during the first stay in 55.3% patients, during follow-up in 13%, without failures among the 80 patients who followed the protocol. Four decannulations performed against protocol recommendations resulted in three failures. Decannulation was mainly prevented by the persistence of respiratory complications and dysphagia that constituted a relevant risk of aspiration and suffocation; decannulation was mainly postponed because of respiratory complications and breath-holding spells in very young children.

Conclusions

By applying a decannulation protocol that privileges safety over quickness, we encountered no failure. Respiratory complications and dysphagia that lead to supraglottic stagnation, and breath-holding spells, are key elements to consider before performing decannulation in pediatric patients.

### Triage in the tower of babel: interpreter services for children in the prehospital setting [^113zktMn]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Minority pediatric populations have higher rates of emergency medical services use than the general pediatric population, and prior studies have documented that limited-English proficiency patients are more likely to undergo invasive procedures, require more resources, and be admitted once they arrive in the emergency department. Furthermore, limited-English proficiency patients may be particularly vulnerable because of immigration or political concerns. In this case report, we describe an infant with breath-holding spells for whom a language barrier in the prehospital setting resulted in an escalation of care to the highest level of trauma team activation. This infant underwent unnecessary, costly, and harmful interventions because of a lack of interpreter services. In a discussion of the legal, ethical, and medical implications of this case, we conclude that further investigation into prehospital strategies for overcoming language barriers is required to provide optimal prehospital care for pediatric patients.

### The clinical journey of patients with riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2 [^113ki1ob]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify symptoms and health care interactions with patients with riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) type 2 prior to diagnosis.

Methods

Parents of children with riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2 (n = 10) were interviewed to collect data on the patient's clinical journey.

Results

The average diagnostic delay was 27.6 months. Neurologists were the most commonly visited clinician (90%). Common symptoms during the first year of the patient's clinical journey included abnormal gait and/or ataxia (70%), nystagmus (50%), and upper body muscle weakness (40%). Prior to diagnosis, optic atrophy, sleep apnea, breath-holding spells, and dysphagia were commonly observed. Hearing loss was only reported in 40% of subjects prior to diagnosis. Riboflavin responsive megaloblastic anemia is reported for the first time. Mitochondrial disease was the most common suspected diagnosis (30%).

Conclusion

Despite clinical variability, common early symptoms of riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2 exist that can better allow clinicians to more rapidly identify riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2.

### Cognitive impairment associated with low ferritin responsive to iron supplementation [^117UvSRQ]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in children. It affects 9% of children ages 1–3 years. Iron is essential for effective mitochondrial electron transport and neurotransmitter synthesis. Iron deficiency has been correlated with impaired psychomotor development, pica, attention deficit disorder, periodic limb movements of sleep, and breath-holding spells. Ferritin is the storage form of iron.

Patient Series

We assessed three children referred for developmental concerns. Extensive testing and neuroimaging were all unremarkable except for low iron stores. Dietary histories revealed excessive milk consumption in two of the children. After dietary adjustments and iron supplementation, iron stores normalized.

Conclusions

This cohort demonstrated a dramatic improvement in cognition once iron stores were repleted, suggesting iron studies should be considered as part of initial investigations of patients with cognitive concerns.

### Inhaler technique: facts and fantasies. A view from the aerosol drug management improvement team (ADMIT) [^111zdoHa]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

3. Breath-holding after inhalation is clinically beneficial

Inhaled particles exert their therapeutic effects after making contact with the surface of the bronchial or alveolar epithelium and delivering the drugs they contain to their receptors on cells situated therein. As this contact is initiated by random collision of the particles with the epithelial surface during Brownian motion, it would appear intuitive to hypothesise that exhalation soon after inhalation, particularly with fine particles before they interact with the epithelium, could reduce clinical efficacy of the drug. It is very difficult to address this hypothesis because many other aspects of inhaler technique, such as the speed and extent of inhalation, can also influence particle deposition. Furthermore, it is also very difficult to detect small changes in clinical effects in the short term that may result from breath-holding.

One studyusing radiolabelled Teflon particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.2 microns found that a 10- s compared with a 4-s breath-hold significantly increased lung deposition of the particles, but only if (i) inspiration was initiated at 50–80% of vital capacity, which is not how inhalers are generally taken, and (ii) inspiration was slow (25 l m −1, as is generally recommended routinely). There was no measurable effect when inhalation was initiated at 20% of vital capacity (the more usual situation when using an inhaler routinely) or when the inspiratory flow rate was high (approximately 80 litres per minute). Similar findings were reported in another study. A pharmacokinetic study using carefully standardised inhalation manoeuvres showed significantly greater bioavailability of salbutamol absorbed from the airways following a 10-s breath-hold compared with no breath-hold.

Screening

The review article of Cinallirecommends MRI-scanning in the syndromic craniosynostosis group with a high risk of Chiari I malformation, but preferred ages or frequencies are not mentioned. Synostosis of the lambdoid sutures within the first 24 months of life seems to be a risk factor for Chiari I malformation.

In an earlier study by Cinallino more than 19% (6/44) of the Crouzon patients with tonsillar herniation were symptomatic. In the review article of Cinalli, more than one third of the patients had developed symptoms of Chiari I malformation or syringomyelia at later age. Symptoms included suboccipital pain, painful torticollis, syringomyelia syndrome, respiratory arrest, life-threatening brainstem dysfunction, and axial hypotonia. Symptoms may develop rapidly, especially in very young children: breathing problems (central apneas), bilateral vocal cord paralysis, bulbar palsy, ventilatory control problems, persisting cyanosis, and breath-holding spells.

In a study by Fearon,10 of the 28 Pfeiffer patients underwent operative decompression in Chiari I malformation on account of swallowing and coordination problems, headache when coughing, syrinx formation, and central apneas. Protocolled screening with annual MRI until adulthood is recommended without further underpinning.

### Neurocognitive monitoring in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome with the NIH toolbox ® [^115xmhFd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), which is characterized by alveolar hypoventilation with insufficient or absent ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, is a rare disorder of autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. Although it typically presents in the newborn period, a small subset of individuals with CCHS is not identified until later in life, described as having Later‐Onset CCHS (LO‐CCHS). Throughout this report, the term CCHS is used to describe patients with disease onset both in the newborn period and thereafter.

CCHS arises from a pathogenic mutation of the paired‐like homeobox gene PHOX2B, which is critical for the development of the ANS and neural structures necessary for control of breathing. Artificial ventilation is necessary for survival throughout the individual's lifetime. Less severely affected patients are able to breathe spontaneously when awake, while those who are more severely affected require continuous (24‐h/day) artificial ventilatory support. Even individuals who appear to breathe adequately while awake have attenuated or absent physiologic responses and behavioral perceptions of hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

The potential for repeated hypoxemic and hypercarbic events from severe cyanotic breath‐holding spells, exertional physiologic compromise, and suboptimal or noncompliant ventilatory support places individuals with CCHS at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Alterations of brain structure and function intrinsic to CCHS have been identified which may be exacerbated by hypoxic events, with changes to cortical and subcortical structures that may contribute to neurocognitive deficits.,

Overall intellectual functioning in CCHS varies broadly, ranging from below average to superior, and several areas of cognitive vulnerability have been identified. Differences have been noted in cognitive subdomains such as fluid reasoning, visuoperceptual reasoning, clerical/processing speed, working memory, sequential processing, and verbal ability. Variables found to be related to cognitive outcomes have included PHOX2B genotype, age at assessment (i.e. preschool vs. school‐age), introduction of positive pressure ventilation via tracheostomy in the first 3 months of life, and compliance with recommended ventilatory support and limitations on strenuous activities. The broad spectrum of cognitive outcomes in CCHS underscores the need for longitudinal neurocognitive testing, with the aim to personalize management and optimize cognitive functioning.

### Spontaneous resolution of Chiari malformation type I in monozygotic twins [^117UKFbY]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The spontaneous resolution of isolated tonsillar ectopia in Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a known and reported entity in 2 previous single study case reports. However, it has not been previously described in monozygotic twins. Two children, approximately 1 year of age with CM-I and presumed episodes of pallid syncope or breath-holding spells presented for neurosurgical evaluation. Although Chiari decompression was considered, the authors decided to proceed with conservative management with close follow-up due to the uncertain nature of these episodes. Approximately 4 years later, both children's symptoms had resolved. Repeated MR imaging examinations also showed spontaneous resolution of the malformation in both girls. These cases emphasize that when patients with CM-I present with atypical symptoms, spontaneous resolution or improvement is possible, which may influence the decision to pursue a trial of nonsurgical management. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic influences of CM-I are also briefly discussed.

### Evaluation of heart rate variability in children with breath-holding episodes [^113ftyQ5]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

We evaluated heart rate variability in children with breath-holding episodes (BHEs).

Methods

Sixty children with BHEs were included in the study; these individuals were further subdivided into children with cyanotic BHEs (n = 42) and children with pallid BHE (n = 18). Sixty healthy children of matched age and sex served as a control group. Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring was applied to all included children. Minimum, mean, maximum heart rate, rhythms, and corrected QT were evaluated. Time domain parameters of heart rate variability such as standard deviation of all R-R intervals, standard deviation of the average of R-R intervals in all five-minute segments of the entire recording, mean of the standard deviations of all N-N (normal-normal RR) intervals for all five-minute segments, root mean squares differences between adjacent R-R intervals, percentage of differences between adjacent R-R intervals that are greater than 50 milliseconds were also assessed.

Results

All time domain parameters of heart rate variability were significantly higher in children with pallid BHEs than those with cyanotic BHEs and control group. Minimum, mean, and maximum heart rate were significantly lower in children with pallid BHEs than those with cyanotic BHEs and control group. Asystole was observed in three children with pallid BHEs. Long corrected QT was observed in another two children with pallid BHEs.

Conclusions

Heart rate variability increased significantly in children with pallid BHEs. Evaluation of heart rate variability is crucial for children with BHEs especially those with pallid episodes.

### The effectiveness of breath-holding to stabilize lung and pancreas tumors during radiosurgery [^113ULKXK]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of breath-holding on the short-term reproducibility and long-term variability of tumor position during image-guided radiosurgery.

Method

Thirteen patients have undergone single-fraction radiosurgery treatments during which the tumor was repeatedly imaged radiographically to observe its position. The imaging data were used to monitor the efficacy of breath-holding and to periodically readjust the alignment of the treatment beam with the tumor. These measurements have allowed the effects of breathing, heartbeat, patient movement, and instrumental uncertainties to be separately identified in the record of tumor position.

Results

During inspiration breath-holding, the lung tumor position was reproducible to within 1 mm, on average, in the direction of maximum displacement during regular breathing, and to within 1.8 mm in three dimensions overall. The pancreas tumor position in three dimensions was reproducible to within 2.5 mm on average. Some patients showed a slow, steady drift of tumor position during the extended sequence of breath-holds, which was compensated by periodic retargeting of the treatment beam.

Conclusion

Breath-holding can allow the reduction of tumor motion dosimetry margins to 2 mm or less for lung cancer treatments, provided that the treatment system can detect and adapt to long-term variations in the mean tumor position during a lengthy treatment fraction.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^112JeQe8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Panic disorder and air hunger descriptors — unexplained dyspnea is one of the hallmarks of panic disorder, and clustering of suffocating, smothering, and air hunger has been observed in patients with panic disorder in response to breath-holding and carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing or challenge; similar clustering has been reported in idiopathic hyperventilation without cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. This suggests that, in susceptible individuals, air hunger may occur even in the absence of reduced ventilatory capacity, with possible roles for excessive ventilatory drive, impaired perception of achieved ventilation, increased sensitivity to CO2 (potentially with a genetic component), or excessive responses to cerebral acidosis or hypoxia due to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Whatever term is used, it represents a perception that the drive to breathe is not being matched by adequate pulmonary ventilation.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^115dRaT4]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 4-year-old girl was admitted to our clinic with a 2 years history of choking episodes during sleep that occurred 4–5 times almost every night. The patient had no familial history of epilepsy or allergic disease, and her weight and height were within the normal range according to the Korean growth charts.

During the initial evaluation performed 2 years before, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard PSG revealed no abnormalities. Because the EEG revealed few focal epileptiform discharges in the left frontal area, the patient was prescribed an antiepileptic medication; however, her nocturnal spells persisted.

Upon the admission, we performed PSG with video-EEG. Five choking episodes were observed on the video; the patient awakened suddenly, sat up, and experienced episodes of choking, air hunger, agitation, and intense fear; in two episodes, with the patient showed gagging gestures just after awakening. During these periods, PSG recording and diagnostic parameters showed that the patient was in stage 3 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and experienced obstructive or mixed-type apnea, followed by arousal and awakening with dyspnea and tachycardia. The peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp0 2) decreased to 83%. During these episodes, the patient's parents performed back percussion and provided reassurance. Episodes typically resolved within 1–3 min and the patient fell asleep again after each event.

### Disrupted breath, songlines of breathlessness: an interdisciplinary response [^1116g1DM]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinician's gaze

JD: As a specialist respiratory physician working in a busy teaching hospital, I supervise the care of acutely unwell patients admitted to hospital with lung disease and meet people in outpatient clinic sent to me by their GP and other healthcare professionals for assessment and advice about lung disease and breathing problems. While medical school and specialist training are grounded in traditional sciences such as physiology and biology, a good clinician appreciates that much of what we do is to synthesise subjective and 'objective' evidence accumulated through listening to our patients. We supplement this through physical examination and investigations including imaging and physiological measurements. It is the synthesis of this information, applied in the psychosocial context of the person sitting in front of us, that has long been considered the 'art' of medicine. Much of what is asked of me requires pragmatic output, in the form of diagnosis, advice on further investigations, monitoring and treatment. My clinical gaze in reviewing this transcript recognises the tension between the clinicians who develop these questionnaires, in an attempt to quantify breathlessness in a clinically meaningful way and the almost impossible task of capturing the truth of an individual's experience of breathlessness at any given moment.

### The deep breath before the plunge: ictal apnea and the amygdala [^116rT2Ze]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The Deep Breath Before the Plunge: Ictal Apnea and the Amygdala

Many of us have seen, either as health care professionals, or carers, the dramatic and terrifying cessation of breathing during a seizure. The person turns blue due to cyanosis, often just prior to the descent into convulsion, and it can seem like an eternity before respiration is revived again. This phenomenon is more common than we think, occurring in over one-third of focal seizures.

This often neglected component of seizure semiology (we generally do not measure respiratory effort in the epilepsy monitoring unit) has been addressed by several recent studies. - In addition, seizure-induced respiratory suppression may be an important element in progression to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

Given that central apnea is felt to be pivotal in the evolution of SUDEP, determination of the underlying pathophysiological mechanism and its neuroanatomical correlate (symptomatogenic zone) is of utmost importance.

Interest in cerebral control of respiration, and its role in seizures has its origins in early reports, animal experiments, and Kaada and Jasper's stimulation studies.

The amygdala has been identified as having a possible role in ictal apnea. The amygdala contains several groups of distinct nuclei, each with varied functions and connections. We mostly associate the amygdala with emotions, and the amygdala is located in close proximity to the rest of the limbic system. Although primary centers for respiration lie in the pacemaker pre-Bötzinger cells of the ventrolateral medulla, suprapontine connections can influence patterns of respiration. For example, the hyperventilation seen in excited or emotional states, or breathing variations during speech, or just "holding our breath". There is also a role of the amygdala in response to threat, perhaps an evolutionary survival advantage, overriding automatic control and "holding your breath while the predator is near". Removal or damage to both amydgala in animals and humans leads to reduced autonomic arousal and a docile state, the "Klüver-Bucy syndrome".

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2015). Medium credibility.

Breath holding instruction for cardiac CT in congenital heart disease: CT imaging with suspended respiration is usually required for the highest quality images, although respiratory motion artifact generally does not significantly impact image quality with certain scan sequences on the newest volumetric or highest pitch scanners; breath-holding instructions should be discussed prior to the scan and practicing the breath hold several times in the scanner helps alleviate anxiety, improves compliance during scanning and the reliability of the breath hold; suspended respiration may be performed during end-inspiration or end-expiration, with end inspiration best if concomitant assessment of lung parenchyma is indicated; for those who cannot cooperate for breath holding, quiet breathing is preferred; under general anesthesia suspended respiration should be used to minimize respiratory motion artifact, but in some critically ill patients requiring high PEEP ventilator settings breath holding should be minimized as much as possible.

Patient positioning and breathing for SPECT/CT registration — most systems do not position the patient the same for SPECT and CT, the CT scan duration is much shorter than SPECT, and inspiration breath-hold makes body shape very different; ASNC guidelines recommend the patient be instructed to breath shallowly (free tidal breathing) or to hold their breath after exhaling, and after acquisition the registration should be checked and corrected if necessary. The CT scan should be examined for abnormalities and, if found, reported, with added value of assessing for coronary artery calcification to detect subclinical CAD.

### Audiovisual biofeedback guided breath-hold improves lung tumor position reproducibility and volume consistency [^111Mg3bx]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breath-hold techniques are frequently used to immobilize respiratory-induced tumor motion, leading to the reduction of respiratory-related motion artifacts in medical imaging and clinically meaningful tumor positions and shapes in respiratory-gated radiation treatment. In addition, the immobilization of lung tumorscan reduce phase or time shift between surrogates (ie, abdomen, chest, and diaphragm) and tumorsand system latency between tumor positioning and gating. Immobilizing the tumor position is advantageous in reducing treatment margins and treatment delivery time.

Several breath-hold strategies have been studied and practiced to maintain the same level of breathing in repeated breath-holds. Deep inspiration breath-hold has improved the reproducibility of intra- and interfraction target positions compared with free-breathing. Conventional breath-hold (inhalation and exhalation positions of free breathing) using the audio instructions of a computed tomography (CT) scanner (automated "breathe in", "breathe out", and "hold your breath" commands) reduced the variation of exhalation diaphragm positions compared with free-breathing. An active breathing coordinator (ABC) forcibly suspends patient breathing without automated verbal or audio instruction at predetermined positions of lung volume. ABC has been demonstrated to improve intrafraction tumor position reproducibility but still needs to improve a large variation of interfraction tumor positions > 5 mm. A quasi-breath-hold using consecutive short breath-holds (3, 5, or 7 seconds) has demonstrated equivalent or less motion variation while improving breath-hold efficiency. Visual biofeedback techniques have also reduced the uncertainty of target position by improving the reproducibility of abdominal and chest wall and pancreatic tumor positions using voluntary breath-hold techniques. However, lung tumor position reproducibility and volume consistency using audiovisual guidance for inhalation and exhalation breath-holds for precise lung cancer radiation therapy has not been studied.

### The association of kidney function with repetitive breath-hold diving activities of female divers from Korea, haenyeo [^112g6su6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Apnea, whether voluntary or involuntary, induces several physiological changes, which are a type of protective responses to hypoxia and involve potential health hazards as well. Voluntary apnea during breath-hold diving (BHD) induces cardiovascular adaptations characterized by bradycardia with reduced cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction with increased blood pressure (BP), which are together currently known as the human diving response. Bradycardia is elicited by increased vagal activity, and peripheral vasoconstriction is related to increased sympathetic activity. The pronounced bradycardia during BHD reduces oxygen consumption by the heart, and selective vasoconstriction mainly redistributes decreased cardiac output to the heart and brain, which are the most sensitive to hypoxia, making other tissues more likely to be exposed to relatively greater levels of hypoxia.

Excessive hypoxia due to extreme BHD activity can be very dangerous and can lead to serious acute health problems, such as pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmias, blackout, decompression sickness, and even death. However, although acute cardiovascular changes induced during BHD and fatal complicaitons by extreme diving have been studied, the long-term effects of shallow but frequent intermittent apnea by repetitive BHD have not been well studied. Based on the aforementioned cardiovascular diving response, there is a possibility that even shallow but prolonged repetitive apnea by BHD may cause negative health consequences such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular disease. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which breathing stops involuntarily for a short time during sleep, has something in common with BHD in terms of the repeated exposure to intermittent apnea-induced hypoxia, even though it's pathophysiology is different from what of BHD. The cardiovascular complications of OSA were shown in previous studies and the chronic intermittent hypoxia was suggested as one of the mechanisms responsible for sympathetic activation and increased cardiovascular morbidity in OSA. Therefore, the notion that breath-hold divers are exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia, similar circumstance to patients with OSA, may raise a possibility that BHD may potentially predispose breath-hold divers to long-term health risks by exposing them to chronic frequent hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, as kidney function and cardiovascular disease are closely associated and BHD induces cardiovascular changes, we hypothesize that renal impairment may be one of the potential long-term health risks of repetitive BHD.

Cardiac CT acquisition and breath-hold needs — For detailed coronary imaging in patients of all ages, breath holding is usually required during image acquisition to eliminate respiratory motion, whereas for other anatomic imaging the need for a breath hold depends on scan acquisition time, the portion of the cardiac cycle imaged, and image quality requirements; with newer generation scanners, the time of image acquisition is less than a second or a single heartbeat and techniques such as half-scan reconstruction, prospectively ECG triggered high pitch scan mode or volumetric target mode reduce both respiratory and cardiac motion, while with older generation scanners with images acquired over several seconds or multiple heart beats, breath holding may be required to reduce motion artifact, particularly when trying to image the cardiac structures.

RVOT CT sedation and breath-hold — A breath-hold sequence is optimal to avoid respiratory motion artifact, and developmentally normal patients older than 7 years can usually cooperate; for purely anatomic scans, breath-hold may not be required if the patient can remain still, but younger pediatric patients may need sedation or anesthesia for breath-hold imaging when a functional scan is required.

### Clinical validation of a 3-dimensional ultrafast cardiac magnetic resonance protocol including single breath-hold 3-dimensional sequences [^1145BidY]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional ESSOS cine acquisition requires a breath-hold of approximately 24 s. Although most individuals can tolerate this, such long breath-holds may not be achievable for some patients. In recent implementations of the sequence, the research team managed to reduce breath-hold to < 15 s with no significant loss of resolution; however, this shorter protocol was not attempted in the cohort reported here. This protocol does not include CMR mapping techniques able to track the dynamics of complex pathophysiological processes occurring after myocardial infarction and other pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, mapping sequences could be implemented before contrast administration at the cost of increasing total protocol time. For validation purposes, we performed contrast administration after the acquisition of 2D cine imaging. However, for clinical practice implementation of the present protocol, contrast could be administered with the patient positioned on the bed or even outside the magnet, dramatically shortening patient time inside the scanner. It should be highlighted that when parametric acquisitions (e.g. native T1, T2, or T2✱ mapping) are planned, they should be performed before injection of the contrast agent. This will significantly extend the study, not just by the time of mapping acquisition but also the 10-min lag between contrast injection and 3D ESSOS and 3D LGE acquisition.

ASTRO pancreatic cancer radiation therapy — respiratory motion management: In a study of 19 patients, mean tumor motion in the L-R/A-P/S-I directions was 0.5/0.5/0.9 cm with compression versus 0.5/0.7/1.4 cm without, leading to reduced ITV margins in the A-P and S-I dimensions; in the same 19 patients, gating with a 40% duty cycle around end-expiration reduced motion to 0.3/0.4/0.6 cm and allowed ITV margin expansions of 0.2 cm (left, right, anterior, posterior) and 0.3 cm (superior, inferior) to encompass 95% of target motion, while another report showed gating reduced motion from 0.3/0.6/1.3 cm to 0.3/0.2/0.5 cm with margins reduced by approximately 50%. Data support carefully monitored breath-hold to minimize motion, end-exhalation breath-hold levels have been shown to be quite reproducible, and voluntary breath-holding without dedicated equipment is not recommended; across breath-hold and gating, end-exhalation is believed more reproducible than inhalation, with studies finding end-expiration gating superior to end inhalation and enabling smaller margins and less motion for the same duty cycle, and motion after breath-hold smaller at end-expiration than at end inhalation.

Patient positioning and position verification — Statement KQ4E specifies that patients should be positioned considering the reproducibility of the breast for treatment, skin folds should be unfolded to the extent possible, for patients with a large breast size prone positioning may be used to further minimize dose to normal tissues, and care should be taken to ensure that the contralateral breast is not in the treatment fields; Recommendation strength: Strong, Quality of evidence: High, Consensus: 100%. When considering the reproducibility of patient positioning, a margin of 5 mm or less was determined to be an adequate treatment planning target margin based on an evaluation of weekly setup ports for more than 100 patients. Deep inspiration breath hold techniques have been found to be tolerated very well and the accuracy of positioning for supine patients when using deep inspiration breath hold has been shown to be reliable, and regardless of the positioning technique, additional factors affecting patient position are the patient's comfort and the length of time on the treatment table.

### Disrupted breath, songlines of breathlessness: an interdisciplinary response [^114KYdLX]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Another rift is revealed in the conflicting attitudes and emotions characterising the interviewee's relationship to his breath. He is unsure whether muscles are involved in breathing; he is uncertain as to whether one can exercise one's brain; he finds the difference between breathing at rest and on exertion baffling. The text is full of gaps, gasps, abrupt halts, question marks: 'is that me?' 'my lungs haven't got any muscles, have they?' 'I don't think it, I don't think it does'. It reads a little like a Beckettian monologue: full of about-faces, abrupt stops, gaps, unfinished sentences. The text itself is breathless. The interview performs the breathlessness of the interviewee. The interviewee tries to describe the experience of breathlessness, but language seems to fall short of the task. "… and you, then you're trying to get, fill your lungs and calm down. you come back in again and you go… and you're gasping for breath, you take deep breaths, as much as you can until it gets painful, to try and breathe… " The text is textured by sounds of breath: deep inhalations, throat clearing, gasping and sighing. These are all breath sounds, voiced exhalations. And they punctuate the text excessively, mirroring the continued yet failed attempt to tame, calm and understand the breath.

The final rift is that of failure(s). The rift between attempting to understand breathlessness and failing to grasp it. And between attempting to control the breath and succumbing to breathlessness. Given this internal turmoil, it is not surprising that breathlessness remains poorly understood by health professionals and those who do not suffer from it. This excerpt exemplifies how difficult it is to speak about breathlessness and how difficult it is to speak when breathless. The two difficulties intertwine in profound and complex ways, making breathlessness invisible. What the interview enacts is the difficulty of expressing this intimate yet overwhelming experience. It is hard to put into words and it is also hard to get the words out when one is so short of breath.

### Automated daily breath hold stability measurements by real-time imaging in radiotherapy of breast cancer [^116MqewH]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Breath hold is increasingly used for cardiac sparing in left-sided breast cancer irradiation. We have developed a fast automated method to verify breath hold stability in each treatment fraction.

Material and Methods

We evaluated 504 patients treated with breath hold. Moderate deep inspiration breath hold was audio-guided. Medial and lateral large tangential field segments were delivered in a single breath hold and movieloops of these fields were acquired with an EPID. The thoracic wall position was automatically detected in each frame and the full range of thoracic wall motion (RTWM) was determined. If the RTWM > 4mm more than 3 times, the patient was excluded from breath hold treatment if further coaching did not yield improvement.

Results

Unstable breath hold was observed in 2.8% of the patients. However, this frequency dropped from 9.5% in the first 6months to 1.6% in the subsequent 16months. The 97% of patients with proper breath hold showed excellent stability: the average RTWM was 0.9 ± 0.5mm. The reproducibility of the breath hold depth was confirmed by (1) the small difference between the thoracic wall positions in the medial and lateral fields within one fraction and (2) the setup errors of breath hold patients showed no significant differences with those of right-sided breast patients.

Conclusions

We have developed and clinically applied an imaging tool to automatically determine stability of breath holds in each treatment fraction during beam delivery.

### Geometric reproducibility of fiducial markers and efficacy of a patient-specific margin design using deep inspiration breath hold for stereotactic body radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer [^112KHbQ2]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tumors located in the abdominothoracic area, such as the lung, liver, or pancreas, are highly susceptible to clinically significant respiratory motion during radiation therapy (RT). Many investigators have reported that tumor motion can range from 0 to 40 mm under shallow free breathing. The internal target volume (ITV) is an effective measure to account for tumor motion by encompassing the motion range as a margin. With the present use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for effective patient setup, the ITV often contributes to the largest portion of the total margin, and the resultant abutment or overlap with an organ at risk (OAR) significantly compromises the ability to deliver the therapeutic radiation dose safely without inflicting deleterious toxicity. Therefore, use of tumor-motion management is imperative for safe delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to these sites, especially for pancreatic tumors, given the proximity of highly radiosensitive organs such as the duodenum and stomach.

Among various motion-mitigation techniques, including breath-hold, beam gating, and real-time tumor-motion compensation using a multileaf collimator or couch, the deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH) prevents tumor motion by asking patients to hold their breath after taking deep inspiration. The effectiveness of the DIBH largely depends on achieving consistent reproducibility of tumor positioning with each breath hold (interbreath-hold variation), especially because multiple breath holds are typically needed to complete delivery of the treatment fraction. Extensive studies in lung and liver tumors with DIBH have reported interbreath-hold variation of less than 2 mm on average, regardless of various breath-hold techniques. However, interbreath-hold reproducibility when treating pancreatic tumors with DIBH presents unique challenges because it is influenced by both the diaphragm and abutting abdominal soft tissues and has not been well characterized in a robust manner.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2016). Medium credibility.

Coronary CTA breath‑hold training and acquisition — It is essential to minimize respiratory motion during image acquisition, and coronary CTA should be acquired during an inspiratory breath‑hold. Prior to scan initiation, patients should be provided specific instructions and offered practice in the form of a test breath‑hold, ideally following ECG lead placement with the patient on the scanner table, with the test breath‑hold designed to ensure appropriate quality of the breath‑hold, to ensure adequate timing of the breath‑hold, and to observe fluctuations in heart rate and rhythm during the breath‑hold exercise. Coronary CTA should not be performed if a patient cannot adhere to breath‑hold commands, and it is strongly advised that all steps of the scan protocol including scout topogram, calcium score and test bolus if performed, as well as the coronary CTA acquisition, be performed using identical breath‑hold commands.

The methods used for the diagnosis of CCHS in the 123 patients have been shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Methods used in the diagnosis of CCHS (n = 123)

PHOX2B gene mutations were detected in 71 (96%) of the 74 patients who underwent a genetic test. Other patients were diagnosed with CCHS by a composite approach, such as clinical manifestations, SpO 2 monitoring during sleep, blood gas analysis, the CO 2 ventilation response, end-tidal CO 2, ventilation volume, and percutaneous CO 2 monitoring. Table 2 depicts the distribution of age at the times of onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis.

Table 2
Age at the onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis

In terms of the age at the time of onset of symptoms, there were no significant differences observed between the two groups of patients, i.e. patients with tracheostomy and patients with mask ventilation (P = 0.07). However, in terms of the age at diagnosis, patients with tracheostomy were diagnosed earlier than patients with mask ventilation (P = 0.04). There is one patient whose age at the onset of symptom is unknown. Most patients (97%) experienced the onset of symptoms within one month after birth, and 72% of the patients received a diagnosis within three months of birth.

Complications

Table 3 shows the range of complications experienced by the patients with CCHS. The Hirschsprung disease was present in 53 patients (43%). Epilepsy was present in 23 patients (18.7%). Thirty-two patients with CCHS had an autonomic nervous system disorder, such as arrhythmia and breath-holding spells, excessive sweating, cyanosis when concentrating and defecating, and abnormal regulation of body temperature. Other complications included tracheomalacia, pulmonary hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, atrial/ventricular septal defect, strabismus, and midfacial hypoplasia. Although neuroblastoma is a known complication of CCHS, there were no cases of neuroblastoma in this study.

IC1 hypomethylation in BWS: case report

The proband is a male child born at 41 weeks gestation following an ICSI conception. Birth weight was on the 25th centile and no neonatal hypoglycaemia was reported. However, at age 5 weeks he presented to hospital with a history of breathing problems with breath-holding spells and apnoea. Otolaryngological assessment identified severe macroglossia as contributing to his apnoea and he required a tracheostomy at age 2 months. A referral for clinical genetics assessment was made and clinical examination identified severe macroglossia, postnatal overgrowth (75th centile for weight and 91st centile for head circumference at age 16 weeks, and subsequently 91st centile for weight at age 2 years and 99th centile for weight, 95th centile for head circumference and just below 50th centile for height at age 4 years), ear lobe creases, facial naevus flammeus, umbilical hernia and discrepancy in leg size. No organomegaly was detected on ultrasound scans or normal echocardiogram. A clinical diagnosis of BWS was made and MS-MLPA analysis (MRC Holland) was performed to look for epimutations associated with BWS (IC2 (KvDMR1) loss of methylation or IC1 (H19-IGF2 DMR) hypermethylation). Unexpectedly, IC1 (H19-IGF2 DMR) hypomethylation was detected. No chromosomal copy number abnormalities were detected. In view of the discrepancy between the clinical phenotype of BWS and the molecular findings of SRS, additional methylation analysis was performed at the PLAGL1 and MEST DMRs and loss of methylation was detected at both loci.

### Breath-holding spells in childhood… [^114pEnnP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Childhood breath-holding spells are a common and frightening phenomenon occurring in healthy, otherwise normal children. They have been well recognized for several hundred years. There appear to be two clinical forms: the cyanotic type and the pallid type, referring to the color change exhibited by the child during the episode. Prior research concerning the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in breath-holding spells has implicated an autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Cerebral anoxia is the ultimate factor responsible for the loss of consciousness observed in the severe forms of breath-holding spells. The clinical and epidemiologic aspects of breath-holding spells are herein summarized. The pertinent respiratory and neural physiologic interactions involved are delineated, as well as practical treatment approaches. DiMario FJ. Breath-Holding Spells in Childhood.

BREATH-HOLDING spells are defined as a temporary interruption of respiration at the end of the expiratory phase, leading to mild cyanosis, unconsciousness, or convulsive seizures of either a tonic or clonic nature. In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face; then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum — a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case. HINMAN A, DICKEY LB.

Breath-holding spells are non-epileptic events that often resemble seizures. It is important to diagnose them correctly in order to provide appropriate therapy and prognosis. The onset in most cases is in the first two years of life, and the spells usually cease by four years, with occasional persistence up to eight years. There are two classic forms of breath-holding spells, cyanotic and pallid. A third category of mixed spells sometimes is used when there are no distinct color changes. All forms are characterized by episodes of loss of consciousness that may be followed by convulsive movements. About 50% of affected children have cyanotic breath-holding spells, which typically are triggered by emotional distress, crying or both. The etiology appears to be respiratory. Belying the term "breath-holding, " the child typically experiences prolonged expiratory apnea, causing oxygen desaturation and cyanosis, followed by loss of consciousness.

Pallid breath-holding spells occur in 30% of.
