## Question

Can isotretinoin be prescribed in primary care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether isotretinoin can be prescribed in primary care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory framework and labeled indications. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about who should initiate isotretinoin. Next, I will examine practical considerations like risk programs, monitoring, and safety. After that, I should review any exceptions or regional variations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion with next steps for primary care clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling restricts isotretinoin to severe recalcitrant nodular acne in non-pregnant patients aged 12 years and older, and it emphasizes that use is reserved for those unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics, with explicit boxed warnings for teratogenicity and mandated participation in the iPLEDGE Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for all prescribers and patients, especially those who can become pregnant [^1135UsEA] [^112zfnK9] [^11722LS1].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines say about prescriber setting. The AAD 2024 guideline recommends isotretinoin for severe nodular acne and for moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or causing scarring or psychosocial distress, and it stresses mandatory iPLEDGE participation and baseline and on-treatment monitoring of lipids and liver enzymes, but it does not explicitly endorse primary care initiation, aligning with specialist-led prescribing in practice [^116eoULC] [^11722LS1] [^115tjZgS]. I should also confirm UK guidance: the MHRA specifies that isotretinoin should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in systemic retinoids and a full understanding of risks and monitoring, and recent safety measures require two health professionals to agree before initiating therapy in patients under 18 years, which effectively places initiation outside routine primary care scope [^115FZBzG] [^112WEAPf] [^116omcoy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check practical barriers that make primary care initiation difficult. iPLEDGE requires prescriber registration, monthly pregnancy testing for those who can become pregnant, and strict contraception counseling, which are operationally complex and typically coordinated in dermatology settings; moreover, baseline and periodic laboratory monitoring for hepatic transaminases and fasting lipids are recommended, and although expert consensus supports a streamlined approach rather than monthly labs for all, this still requires infrastructure and comfort with interpretation that many primary care practices may lack [^112ZNZxb] [^112tuEAk] [^116pvwVX]. I should double-check that the AAD also supports baseline and on-treatment lipid and liver monitoring, which reinforces the need for systems to track results and act on abnormalities during therapy [^116eoULC].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions or regional practice patterns. Let me consider whether any authoritative sources allow primary care initiation. Some family medicine literature has argued that trained primary care physicians can manage isotretinoin, citing the feasibility of iPLEDGE and lab monitoring; however, these are opinion pieces and do not supersede regulatory and specialty-guideline constraints, and they acknowledge that many family physicians still do not prescribe for liability, complexity, and access reasons [^1157PLqG] [^113yuWTg]. I should confirm that contemporary guidance and regulatory updates have, if anything, tightened oversight rather than expanded primary care initiation, particularly in the UK with new safety measures and dual-professional agreement for patients under 18 [^112WEAPf] [^116omcoy].

> Next, I should review the clinical scenarios that trigger isotretinoin to ensure I'm not missing a primary care pathway. Isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne and for moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or causing scarring or significant psychosocial burden; in these situations, guidelines emphasize timely referral for specialist evaluation rather than primary care initiation, given the risk profile and the need for experienced counseling and monitoring [^116eoULC] [^115sg9Qn] [^11722LS1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that primary care could start isotretinoin for moderate scarring acne; I should correct that — guidelines recommend isotretinoin in these cases but still situate initiation within specialist care due to safety and REMS requirements [^116eoULC] [^115sg9Qn].

> I will now examine whether any economic analyses suggest a primary care role. Cost-effectiveness studies of acne treatments within NHS pathways model isotretinoin use in secondary care contexts and incorporate specialist monitoring and iPLEDGE-like processes, reinforcing that the resource use and accountability structures are not aligned with routine primary care initiation [^115EQi2a] [^111smCSK]. Let me reconsider if any of these models explicitly allow GP-led initiation; I do not see evidence supporting primary care initiation in these analyses, which assume dermatology-led prescribing and follow-up [^115EQi2a] [^111smCSK].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, isotretinoin is generally not prescribed in primary care because regulatory labeling, specialty guidelines, and risk-management infrastructure require prescriber expertise, program enrollment, and structured monitoring that are typically coordinated in dermatology; while a minority of primary care clinicians with specific training may theoretically participate, this remains the exception and is not standard practice in the US or UK [^1135UsEA] [^116eoULC] [^115FZBzG]. Primary care's role is to recognize indications, optimize first-line therapies, and expedite referral when isotretinoin is indicated, rather than to initiate therapy [^11722LS1] [^115FZBzG].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical next steps for primary care are clear. For patients with severe nodular acne or with moderate acne that is scarring, psychosocially burdensome, or refractory to appropriate topical and oral regimens, arrange timely dermatology referral; in the meantime, continue evidence-based topical therapy and, if indicated, short courses of oral antibiotics combined with topicals while avoiding antibiotic monotherapy, and counsel patients on iPLEDGE and contraception requirements if isotretinoin is anticipated [^116eoULC] [^117B1Tyi] [^11722LS1]. I should double-check that this aligns with AAD and primary care guidance on limiting antibiotic overuse and escalating appropriately to isotretinoin when indicated, which it does [^116eoULC] [^11722LS1].

Primary care clinicians can prescribe isotretinoin, but **most should refer to dermatology** because of its teratogenicity, serious adverse effects, and the need for strict REMS/iPLEDGE compliance and lab monitoring [^115FZBzG] [^116eoULC]. Only clinicians with appropriate expertise and access to required systems should initiate therapy; **primary care is best suited to first-line acne management and referral** when isotretinoin is indicated [^11722LS1] [^115FZBzG].

---

## Regulatory and legal considerations

- **FDA approval**: Isotretinoin is approved for severe recalcitrant nodular acne unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics [^1135UsEA].

- **REMS/iPLEDGE**: Prescribers must enroll in iPLEDGE, a risk management program to prevent fetal exposure, with monthly pregnancy tests and contraception counseling for females of childbearing potential [^116eoULC].

- **Legal liability**: Prescribers are legally responsible for ensuring safe use, including counseling, monitoring, and documentation.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AAD guidelines recommend isotretinoin for severe nodular acne or moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or causes scarring or psychosocial distress; **primary care should refer** when isotretinoin is indicated [^116eoULC] [^115sg9Qn]. MHRA guidance states isotretinoin should be prescribed only by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in systemic retinoids and a full understanding of risks and monitoring requirements [^115FZBzG]. Primary care's role is **first-line management** with topicals and oral antibiotics, and referral to dermatology for isotretinoin consideration [^11722LS1].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

- **Teratogenicity**: Highly teratogenic; effective contraception is mandatory for females of childbearing potential [^115FZBzG] [^112gAD3n].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Controversial; some reports link isotretinoin to depression and suicidal ideation, though evidence is mixed [^114fVcyL] [^115iCfxn].

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Elevated lipids, liver enzymes, and rare hematologic changes require baseline and periodic monitoring [^116pvwVX] [^112tuEAk].

- **Other effects**: Dry skin/mucosa, musculoskeletal symptoms, and rare pseudotumor cerebri [^112ZNZxb].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up requirements

- **Baseline labs**: Fasting lipid panel, liver function tests, and pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential [^112ZNZxb].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Monthly pregnancy tests, periodic lipid and liver function tests, and clinical assessment for adverse effects [^112ZNZxb].

- **Patient education**: Counseling on adherence, contraception, and recognition of adverse effects [^116eoULC].

---

## Practical considerations for primary care clinicians

- **Expertise and training**: Prescribing requires specific training in acne management, isotretinoin risks, and REMS compliance [^116eoULC].

- **Administrative burden**: iPLEDGE enrollment, monthly documentation, and lab tracking are time-intensive [^116eoULC].

- **Patient selection**: Careful screening for contraindications, psychiatric history, and ability to comply with contraception and monitoring [^116eoULC].

## Benefits and limitations of prescribing isotretinoin in primary care

| **Benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|
| Improved access in underserved areas | Legal liability and malpractice risk |
| Continuity of care with established patients | Administrative burden of REMS/iPLEDGE |
| Potential cost savings | Need for specialized monitoring and lab resources |
| Enhanced patient satisfaction | Limited experience with serious adverse effects |

---

## Alternative approaches

Referral to dermatology is appropriate for severe or treatment-resistant acne, especially when isotretinoin is being considered [^115FZBzG]. Primary care management should focus on **first-line therapies**, including topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, oral antibiotics, and hormonal therapy for appropriate patients [^117B1Tyi].

---

Primary care clinicians can prescribe isotretinoin, but **most should refer to dermatology** due to the drug's risks, REMS requirements, and need for specialized monitoring. Primary care is best focused on first-line acne management and referral when isotretinoin is indicated.

Oral isotretinoin is unrivalled in efficacy and remission capability for treatment of acne. In addition to appropriate monitoring and continued vigilance for safety concerns, appropriate dosing to mitigate avoidable dose-dependent adverse effects is the responsibility of prescribers. Low-dose regimens are better tolerated and effective in inducing acne clearance. Although much progress has been made since the advent of isotretinoin, there remain many unanswered questions regarding optimization to maximize response while minimizing the potential for avoidable adverse events. The ongoing availability of isotretinoin is imperative to patients with acne, their caregivers, and physicians.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116eoULC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

Methods

Population

The study population comprised people with mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne presenting to primary care services. Separate analyses were conducted for males and females with moderate‐to‐severe acne because (i) the intervention cost of oral isotretinoin is higher for females due to pregnancy tests and increased monitoring visits, and (ii) sex‐specific discontinuation data were available for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

Interventions

We included treatment classes showing evidence of efficacy vs. placebo [indicated by 95% credible intervals (CrI) around the effects not crossing the 'no effect' line] in the NMA that informed the NICE guideline (the source NMA). We considered only treatment classes with ≥ 50 observations across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the efficacy NMA, as this was deemed the minimum adequate evidence base to enable robust conclusions on clinical and cost‐effectiveness.

One intervention from each treatment class was selected as representative for costing purposes. All interventions were assumed to be delivered within the NHS. Selection of interventions assessed in the economic analysis (Table 1) was based on their availability and usage in the UK, practicalities of use (e.g. fixed topical treatment combinations were preferred to nonfixed formulations), the size of their evidence base and their risk of side effects relative to other interventions within the class.

Table 1
Types of treatment, classes and interventions assessed in the economic analysis for each level of acne severity.

Economic model structure

A decision tree was constructed to estimate total NHS costs and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment over 1 year (Fig. 1). This time horizon, determined by the available follow‐up data, was deemed adequate to capture longer‐term outcomes and costs of acne treatment without significant extrapolation. Patients were modelled as having excellent, good, moderate or no perceived improvement following treatment (Supplementary Data S1 provides full details of the model).

### Optimizing isotretinoin treatment of acne: update on current recommendations for monitoring, dosing, safety, adverse effects, compliance, and outcomes [^115UTVrt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by dermatologists. It can be severe and result in permanent scars. Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne and has the potential for long-term clearance. Prescribing and monitoring protocols can vary widely among prescribers. Recent studies, reports, and consensus statements help shed light on optimizing the use of isotretinoin for acne. A recent literature review is summarized in this article to help the practitioner optimize isotretinoin use for acne. The article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of standard, high-dose, and low-dose isotretinoin regimens; discusses the current status of controversies surrounding isotretinoin (including depression/suicide, pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease); reviews monitoring recommendations and treatment for hypertriglyceridemia and elevated transaminase levels; and discusses common adverse effects seen with isotretinoin, along with their treatment and prevention.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### Myths of isotretinoin therapy in patients with acne: a personal opinion [^115jj9T5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin therapy for the treatment of severe nodulocystic acne has been used for the last twenty-three years. Its use has been associated with many restrictions to the patient, with some of these based on mythology rather than on scientific evidence. The purpose of the article is to discuss the myths associated with acne treatment with isotretinoin. This article expresses the sole opinion of the author and does not give any guidelines as to the use of isotretinoin.

### High-dose isotretinoin treatment and the rate of retrial, relapse, and adverse effects in patients with acne vulgaris [^113EkMYU]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne. The ideal dosing regimen is unknown.

Objective

To determine the rates of relapse of acne vulgaris and retrial of isotretinoin after high cumulative-dose treatment and the changes to the adverse effect profile.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective, observational, intervention study was conducted from August 1, 2008, to August 31, 2010, in a single academic tertiary care center with multiple providers. A total of 180 patients with acne resistant to other treatments were enrolled. Of these, 116 participated in the 12-month follow-up survey, for a response rate of 64.4%.

Exposure

Patients received isotretinoin, with dosing based on the providers' judgment. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of cumulative dosing (< 220 mg/kg and ≥ 220 mg/kg).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Relapse (treatment with a prescription topical or oral acne medication after a course of isotretinoin) or retrial (retreatment with isotretinoin) at 12-month follow-up and adverse effects experienced during and after 12 months of treatment. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 19.3 years, 51.9% were female, and 74.1% were white. At 12 months' follow-up, 97.4% of the patients reported that their acne was improved. Overall, acne in 32.7% of patients in the study relapsed at 12 months, and 1.72% of the patients required a retrial. In the lower-dose treatment group (< 220 mg/kg), the relapse rate was 47.4% (95% CI, 32.3%-63.0%) compared with 26.9% (95% CI, 18.3%-37.8%) in the high-dose group (P = 0.03). Almost 100% of the patients in both treatment groups developed cheilitis and xerosis during treatment. Retinoid dermatitis was significantly more common in the high-dose treatment group (53.8% vs 31.6%; p = 0.02). None of the other adverse effects was significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

The dosing regimen used in the present study is considerably higher than that used in previous studies of isotretinoin. At 1 year after completion of isotretinoin treatment, we found that patients receiving 220 mg/kg or more had a significantly decreased risk of relapse. Rash was the only adverse effect that was significantly more common in the high-dose group during treatment. This study suggests that significantly higher doses of isotretinoin are effective for treating acne and decreasing relapse rates without increasing adverse effects.

Isotretinoin

The oral retinoid isotretinoin is used for treating severe acne. It was originally marketed under the brand name Roaccutane. The MHRA licensed indication for isotretinoin is for severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne, or acne that is at risk of permanent scarring) that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy. The licence states that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. The MHRA has defined the groups of healthcare professionals who can take the role of Lead Prescriber in making the decision to initiate isotretinoin treatment following a face-to-face assessment with the patient.

Acne conglobate (severe nodular cystic acne) and acne fulminans (acne conglobate with systemic symptoms) require urgent specialist dermatology review and potentially earlier treatment with isotretinoin. Otherwise, it is first necessary to follow the stepwise management of acne recommended in the NICE guidance.

Isotretinoin is an effective treatment for severe acne. There are a number of known and potential adverse effects associated with treatment. Most people will experience dryness of the skin and lips, which can be helped by emollients and lip balm, and a flare in acne is common at the start of treatment. Both of these adverse effects are dose dependent. Blood abnormalities are reasonably common, but in healthy people are usually not serious.

Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic, and therefore, pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and for 1 month after stopping. All people with childbearing potential (people who may be able to become pregnant) must be entered into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP).

### Compliance with national guidelines on isotretinoin: where are we 2 years since the last audit? Results of the national isotretinoin Re-audit 2014 [^114prFAz]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In 2010, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) published clinical guidelines for the safe introduction and continued use of isotretinoin in patients with acne in the UK. The BAD provides UK dermatologists with a facility for national audit, and it undertook an audit on compliance with these guidelines in 2012.

Aim

To determine current clinical practices relating to use of isotretinoin among dermatologists in the UK (including geographical variations) as measured against BAD standards, and to ascertain any improvement since the 2012 audit.

Methods

The 2012 isotretinoin audit proforma was used, with additional questions on clinical setting, complaints and litigation. A web-based survey tool was used for data entry and submission, with email invitation to working, UK-based BAD members (n = 1226) in December 2013 and weekly reminders during the 8.5-week data collection period. Responders were requested to enter data for the three most recent consecutive patients (including one male and one female patient) who had completed treatment within the previous 6 months.

Results

In total, 338 (27.6%) respondents provided data on 1013 patients. Serum lipids were checked in 93.4% of patients and documentation of mental health and/or mood state was recorded in 82.1%. Regarding the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP), 91.6% of female patients of childbearing potential had signed the PPP information form, while 93.3% who had followed the PPP had taken pregnancy tests both before and during treatment, and 54.7% had taken a pregnancy test 5 weeks post-treatment.

Conclusion

Overall, there is currently good compliance with standards. Certain aspects of care that are less frequently preformed, such as pregnancy testing post-treatment, are highlighted.

### Depression and the dermatologist: a critical analysis of contemporary isotretinoin prescribing practices [^112kkfoP]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with current or previous depression who require isotretinoin treatment for acne is a challenging area. Current opinion favours the view that isotretinoin-induced mood disturbance is a rare, idiosyncratic reaction, not reliably related to the presence of pre-existing depression. Nonetheless, in the absence of a definitive high-quality study, there remains a degree of legitimate uncertainty. With input from a psychiatrist, we created and administered a detailed survey featuring a range of low-, medium- and higher-risk clinical scenarios, designed to capture a snapshot of current dermatological practice. Respondents indicated a wide variability in their approach, with a substantial proportion referring on to Psychiatry where this was not deemed necessary. Few dermatologists appreciated the importance of behaviours suggesting impaired impulse control. We hope this study helps to refine guidance for isotretinoin prescribing, both to maximize safety and to ensure that deserving patients with acne are not excluded from appropriate treatment.

### The unknown silent drug reaction in acne patients: rare case of isotretinoin-induced haematuria [^116D3i3c]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is one of the most frequent visits to primary care physicians and dermatologists alike. Isotretinoin is the backbone of acne treatment. In most countries, depending on the health care system, isotretinoin is prescribed by dermatologists but primary care physicians are a part of the follow-up and interpreting analysis. Adverse effects of isotretinoin on the kidney and urinary system are mostly limited to sparse case reports. Specifically, gross and microscopic haematuria is not mentioned to be associated with isotretinoin. Lack of data regarding these adverse effects can lead to doubt regarding further patient management not only with dermatologists but also primary care physicians.

Objective

We report a 16-year-old male patient with isotretinoin-induced haematuria with multiple episodes and subsequent challenge and de-challenge. No personal or familial history of nephrological disease was present. Ultrasound imaging and nephrology workup was within normal limits. Other aetiologies were excluded. Nephrology consult stated there was no contraindication for isotretinoin use and was reinstated at 0.6 m/kg/day. More frequent observation was indicated until completion of isotretinoin.

Conclusion

Our case raises awareness to other dermatologists and primary care physicians that haematuria can be secondary to isotretinoin but not a contraindication for further use if asymptomatic and microscopic. More extensive evaluation and monitoring should be done if the patient is symptomatic with other abnormalities and symptoms. Urinalysis should be a part of routine follow-up monitoring in patients on isotretinoin. Furthermore, delineating and differentiating when to refer to a nephrologist is essential for physicians, patients, and the health care system overall.

### Relapse of acne following isotretinoin treatment: a retrospective study of 405 patients [^1114a94m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Isotretinoin is the most effective systemic treatment option for patients with nodulocystic acne or acne vulgaris who have failed a treatment with systemic antibiotics.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 405 acne patients treated with isotretinoin to evaluate the incidence of recurrence after a course of at least 150 mg/kg of isotretinoin.

Results

Of the 405 patients evaluated, 94 (23.2%) experienced relapses severe enough for the patient to request further medical management. Of the 94 patients, 76 (80.9%) relapsed within the first 2 years following completion of a course of isotretinoin.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study at a single practice site.

Conclusion

Almost one-fifth of patients have a recurrence of acne within the first 2 years. Patients should be made aware of this information, as it will contribute to the development of accurate and appropriate expectations of therapy.

The study prospectively identified 79 women who had been treated for acne with isotretinoin during the periconceptional period, and who were followed up until completion of their pregnancy. Characteristics of exposure and doses were self-reported by participants.

Results

Of the 56 participants who decided to continue their pregnancy, there were 11 spontaneous abortions and 44 women who delivered healthy full-term babies of which 19 had been exposed to isotretinoin < 1 month before conception or during pregnancy. In a nominal logistic regression analysis including 68 patients who provided adequate information for analysis, exposure to isotretinoin > 2 weeks post-conception and pregnancy termination recommended by the first-contact physician were found to be significantly associated with patients' decision to undergo elective abortion: adjusted OR = 9.87 (95% CI 1.18–82.34) and 12.51 (95% CI 2.36–66.29), respectively.

Conclusions

Our study reports an elevated rate of babies born without evidence of gross malformation or neurofunctional abnormality even tough exposure occurred during the teratogenic risk period. However, caution is recommended since a substantial risk of congenital malformations has been reported with low doses of isotretinoin and at exposures limited to early pregnancy. We also found that primary-care physicians may influence patients' decision to request pregnancy termination independently of their timing of exposure to isotretinoin.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115tPF2r]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — dosing and relapse outcomes in severe acne vulgaris (AV): When used for severe AV, isotretinoin is commonly initiated at a starting dose 0.5 mg/kg/day for the first month, then increased to 1.0 mg/kg/day thereafter as tolerated by the patient. In extremely severe cases, even lower starting doses, with or without the concomitant use of oral steroids, may be needed. In earlier studies of optimal dosing in severe AV, doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg/day to 1.0 mg/kg/day were most commonly used, and some efficacy was generally seen at all doses with a dose-dependent decrease in sebum production. While there was not a significant difference in the improvement of acne by the end of the treatment course between doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day in most of the studies, there was a significant difference in relapse rates and the need for retreatment; patients treated with approximately 1.0 mg/kg/day had had a significantly lower relapse rate and a lower rate of retreatment with isotretinoin than those treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day. A lower relapse rate was also seen for those treated with a cumulative dose of > 120 mg/kg.

Therapeutic actives for acne have changed little in the last decade. Recognition that acne is an inflammatory condition, not an infectious one, has led to a call for reduction in antibiotic use, which has culminated in a re-evaluation of our nonantibiotic choices. Spironolactone and oral contraceptives have become more acceptable first-line choices, and earlier use of isotretinoin has been proposed.

### Oral isotretinoin for acne [^1132E26A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit associated with socialisation and mental health problems, may affect more than 80% of teenagers. Isotretinoin is the only drug that targets all primary causal factors of acne; however, it may cause adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess efficacy and safety of oral isotretinoin for acne vulgaris.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and LILACS. We updated this search in March 2018, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We also searched five trial registries, checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant trials, and handsearched dermatology conference proceedings. A separate search for adverse effects of oral isotretinoin was undertaken in MEDLINE and Embase up to September 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of oral isotretinoin in participants with clinically diagnosed acne compared against placebo, any other systemic or topical active therapy, and itself in different formulation, doses, regimens, or course duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 31 RCTs, involving 3836 participants (12 to 55 years) with mild to severe acne. There were twice as many male participants as females. Most studies were undertaken in Asia, Europe, and North America. Outcomes were generally measured between eight to 32 weeks (mean 19.7 weeks) of therapy. Assessed comparisons included oral isotretinoin versus placebo or other treatments such as antibiotics. In addition, different doses, regimens, or formulations of oral isotretinoin were assessed, as well as oral isotretinoin with the addition of topical agents. Pharmaceutical companies funded 12 included trials. All, except three studies, had high risk of bias in at least one domain. Oral isotretinoin compared with oral antibiotics plus topical agentsThese studies included participants with moderate or severe acne and assessed outcomes immediately after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment (short-term). Three studies (400 participants) showed isotretinoin makes no difference in terms of decreasing trial investigator-assessed inflammatory lesion count (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06), with only one serious adverse effect found, which was Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the isotretinoin group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.98). However, we are uncertain about these results as they were based on very low-quality evidence. Isotretinoin may slightly improve (by 15%) acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32; 351 participants; 2 studies), but resulted in more less serious adverse effects (67% higher risk) (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.98; 351 participants; 2 studies), such as dry lips/skin, cheilitis, vomiting, nausea (both outcomes, low-quality evidence). Different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoinFor our primary efficacy outcome, we found three RCTs, but heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. One study (154 participants) reported 79%, 80% and 84% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count after 20 weeks of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg/d of oral isotretinoin for severe acne (low-quality evidence). Another trial (150 participants, severe acne) compared 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/d oral isotretinoin for 20 weeks and, respectively, 58%, 80% and 90% of participants achieved 95% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count. One RCT, of participants with moderate acne, compared isotretinoin for 24 weeks at (a) continuous low dose (0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg/day), (b) continuous conventional dose (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day), and (c) intermittent regimen (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, for one week in a month). Continuous low dose (MD 3.72 lesions; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.31; 40 participants; one study) and conventional dose (MD 3.87 lesions; 95% CI 2.31 to 5.43; 40 participants; one study) had a greater decrease in inflammatory lesion counts compared to intermittent treatment (all outcomes, low-quality evidence). Fourteen RCTs (906 participants, severe and moderate acne) reported that no serious adverse events were observed when comparing different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoin during treatment (from 12 to 32 weeks) or follow-up after end of treatment (up to 48 weeks). Thirteen RCTs (858 participants) analysed frequency of less serious adverse effects, which included skin dryness, hair loss, and itching, but heterogeneity regarding the assessment of the outcome precluded data pooling; hence, there is uncertainty about the results (low- to very-low quality evidence, where assessed). Improvement in acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation, was not measured for this comparison. None of the included RCTs reported birth defects.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence was low-quality for most assessed outcomes. We are unsure if isotretinoin improves acne severity compared with standard oral antibiotic and topical treatment when assessed by a decrease in total inflammatory lesion count, but it may slightly improve physician-assessed acne severity. Only one serious adverse event was reported in the isotretinoin group, which means we are uncertain of the risk of serious adverse effects; however, isotretinoin may result in more minor adverse effects. Heterogeneity in the studies comparing different regimens, doses, or formulations of oral isotretinoin meant we were unable to undertake meta-analysis. Daily treatment may be more effective than treatment for one week each month. None of the studies in this comparison reported serious adverse effects, or measured improvement in acne severity assessed by physician's global evaluation. We are uncertain if there is a difference in number of minor adverse effects, such as skin dryness, between doses/regimens. Evidence quality was lessened due to imprecision and attrition bias. Further studies should ensure clearly reported long- and short-term standardised assessment of improvement in total inflammatory lesion counts, participant-reported outcomes, and full safety accounts. Oral isotretinoin for acne that has not responded to oral antibiotics plus topical agents needs further assessment, as well as different dose/regimens of oral isotretinoin in acne of all severities.

### Systematic review of low-dose isotretinoin for treatment of acne vulgaris: focus on indication, dosage, regimen, efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and follow up, based on clinical studies [^114yRJfs]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe acne and its side effects are mostly dose-dependent. Low dose isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 1 week every 4weeks for 6-months) could be effective and even in its end result, comparable with high or optimal doses. In this systematic review, we aimed to sum up the results of clinical trials regarding indications, dosage, prescription protocol, effectiveness, side effects, patient satisfaction, recurrence rate, and follow-up period of low dose isotretinoin in treatment of acne. Cochrane, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Medline were searched. A total of 460 articles were searched electronically and 382 articles were excluded. About 4 were non-English and 2, before 1980. The full text of 72 articles was reviewed. Finally 15 documents met the inclusion criteria for entering this systematic review. The standard dose of isotretinoin is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 4 months with a total dose of 120–140mg/kg/day. Daily doses between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg can be recommended for more than 6 months due to the occurrence of fewer side effects and more economical concerns. For greater effectiveness, it could be combined with other medications.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111smCSK]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Resource use and cost data

The analysis included intervention costs for people who completed a course of treatment and those who discontinued early and the costs of average acne care (AAC), which comprises a mixture of care currently received by people with acne in the NHS, which may include GP consultations, specialist dermatologist care, drug treatment or no treatment. AAC represented NHS care provided to people with acne following early treatment discontinuation, completion of a course of physical treatment, inadequate improvement or relapse. Costs were estimated by combining resource use with respective unit costs.

Intervention resource use was based on relevant descriptions from RCTs included in the source NMA, modified to reflect optimal routine practice in the UK. This incorporated (as relevant) the drug dosage and optimal duration, time of the HCP (GP and/or specialist care), laboratory testing for people receiving oral isotretinoin and any equipment used. Resource use related to AAC was obtained from UK primary care consultation and prescription data, supplemented with expert opinion and further assumptions, particularly regarding specialist care received by a proportion of people with acne. Unit costs were obtained from national sources, and other published literature. Intervention costs are summarized in Table 3, with full details on methods used for their estimation reported in Supplementary Data S6. Details of the estimation of the AAC cost are shown in Supplementary Data S7.

### Consensus statements on the use of novel formulations of isotretinoin: a modified Delphi process [^112qktTh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral isotretinoin remains a mainstay of treatment for severe, recalcitrant nodular acne. Novel formulations of isotretinoin have been developed over the past decade, including lidose isotretinoin and micronized isotretinoin. It is important to understand the differences between isotretinoin formulations to help guide clinical decision-making and selection of isotretinoin therapy. This study aims to provide evidence-based consensus statements regarding the use of novel formulations of isotretinoin for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. The Expert Consensus Group consisted of dermatologists with expertise in the treatment of acne. Voting members met in person to conduct a modified Delphi process; a maximum of 2 rounds of voting were conducted for each consensus statement. A total of 5 statements were generated regarding the use of novel formulations of isotretinoin, addressing the efficacy, tolerability, and side effects of novel isotretinoin formulations. All 5 statements achieved agreement with high consensus. The Expert Consensus Group agrees that individualized selection of isotretinoin therapy is important to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects. Compared to generic isotretinoin, micronized isotretinoin may require lower doses to achieve sufficient plasma concentrations. With the increased bioavailability of micronized formulation, there is no need to calculate cumulative dose; instead, the general recommendation with micronized isotretinoin is to treat for at least 5 months, or longer if needed to achieve clearance. Micronized isotretinoin can be taken in the fed or fasted state and has an acceptable safety profile. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(6):429–432.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7971.

### Isotretinoin treatment for acne and risk of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fVcyL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between isotretinoin treatment for acne and depression is controversial. Quantitative analysis has not yet been conducted.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis, evidence-based examination of the relationship between isotretinoin and depression.

Method

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature published from inception to September 30, 2016, was conducted. Controlled or prospective non-controlled trials on ≥ 15 acne patients receiving isotretinoin treatment were included. The prevalence of depression and change in depression scores were calculated.

Result

Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. In the controlled studies, the change in depression scores from baseline was not significantly different between patients receiving isotretinoin treatment and those receiving an alternative treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.334, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.680 to 0.011). The prevalence of depression after isotretinoin treatment significantly declined (relative risk [RR] 0.588, 95% CI 0.382–0.904). The mean depression scores significantly decreased from baseline (SMD -0.335, 95% CI -0.498 to -0.172).

Limitations

No randomized controlled trials were reviewed; a large inter-study variation was observed.

Conclusions

Isotretinoin treatment for acne does not appear to be associated with an increased risk for depression. Moreover, the treatment of acne appears to ameliorate depressive symptoms.

### Is It safe to operate on patients taking isotretinoin? [^111eaDzA]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Oral isotretinoin is increasingly being used to treat acne and other dermatological conditions. The number of patients who take isotretinoin and wish or need to undergo plastic surgery may be following a similar pattern. Although skin healing is an important concern in the case of patients who use isotretinoin, it is definitely not the only relevant issue when planning surgical intervention.

Methods

Eleven important points regarding surgery safety in patients taking oral isotretinoin were defined. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted by employing the keywords isotretinoin OR 13-cis-retinoic acid. This returned the largest possible number of studies about isotretinoin.

Results

Forty-seven studies matched the selection criteria. Most animal experimental models suggested that isotretinoin at doses commonly used to treat acne is not detrimental to wound healing. Human studies are controversial. However, healing of skeletal muscle could be at increased risk of necrosis.

Conclusions

Association between isotretinoin and problematic skin healing after surgery is being challenged. Also, recommended time between discontinuation of isotretinoin and surgery should be reviewed. While muscle flaps may be endangered in patients taking isotretinoin, healing of other tissues and systemic effects that could compromise surgery safety are rare or detectable before surgery.

### Hormonal therapy for acne: why not as first line therapy? facts and controversies [^113b5BEB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Standard systemic therapeutic agents used in acne include oral antimicrobials, isotretinoin, and hormonal agents. Appropriate patient selection is the key to decide when to use hormonal agents as first-line therapy as well as to achieve optimal results. Indications of hormonal therapy in acne in girls and women include proven ovarian or adrenal hyperandrogenism, recalcitrant acne, acne not responding to repeated courses of oral isotretinoin, acne tarda, polycystic ovary syndrome, or the presence of clinical signs of hyperandrogenism such as androgenic alopecia or the presence of the seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, alopecia syndrome. We describe the hormonal agents currently available for acne treatment, discuss their indications and contraindications, and address the question of whether they may be used as a first-line therapy in acne.

### A prospective trial of the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life and depressive symptoms [^111jHyLc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Isotretinoin is an efficacious treatment for acne, but has been controversially linked with depression.

Objectives

This study aimed to examine the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life(QoL) and depression using a prospective design.

Methods

The WHOQOL-BREF QoL measure and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale were administered to consecutive outpatients with acne who were prescribed either isotretinoin (n = 65) or antibiotic treatment (n = 31). Patients and physicians rated acne severity independently. Groups were compared at baseline with a matched community sample (n = 94) and measurements repeated at 3 months for treatment groups.

Results

There were no differences between the three groups at baseline in terms of age, gender, depression or overall QoL. Acne was more severe in the treatment groups (P < 0.001). Depression was negatively correlated with QoL (P < 0.001)and hence was included as a covariate in repeated-measures analyses of QoL. Acne improved over time in both treatment groups (F = 48.2, P < 0.001). There was no detectable deterioration in depression score in either group (F = 1.1, not significant). QoL in the physical and social domains improved (P < 0.001) while psychological and environmental QoL was unchanged over time. The improvement in social QoL was greater in the isotretinoin group (P < 0.05). Those patients with higher baseline depression scores showed greater improvements in physical, psychological and social QoL (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Treatment of acne improves QoL, particularly in those with more depressive symptoms at the outset. Mood deterioration was not detected, but the possibility of subtle or rare mood effects of isotretinoin cannot be ruled out.

### Laboratory monitoring during isotretinoin therapy for acne: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pvwVX]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Oral isotretinoin has been associated with several adverse effects, but evidence-based estimates of laboratory changes during isotretinoin therapy in large patient samples are limited.

Objective

To develop estimates of the laboratory changes that occur during isotretinoin therapy for acne using extant data and meta-analytic methods.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search strategy using Ovid/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray literature was conducted (1960-August 1, 2013) to identify all relevant studies of isotretinoin use in acne vulgaris. Terms related to acne treatment, isotretinoin, and diagnostic procedures were searched with all available synonyms.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria consisted of clinical trials using oral isotretinoin, doses of 40 mg/d or more, duration of at least 4 weeks, patients aged 9 to 35 years with acne vulgaris, and 10 or more participants. Studies from all countries published in any language were included. Exclusion criteria were use of modified isotretinoin products, isotretinoin therapy for conditions other than acne vulgaris, and concomitant acne therapy. The initial search yielded 342 records; 116 of these were screened for full-text examination.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently reviewed the publications to determine eligibility, and disagreements were resolved by a third author. Generated weighted means and 99% CIs were calculated using the reported means (SDs or SEs). A random effects model was created, and statistical heterogeneity was quantified. Data were analyzed from August 25, 2014, to December 4, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Laboratory values for lipid levels, hepatic function, and complete blood cell count were evaluated.

Results

Data from 61 of the 116 studies were evaluated; 26 studies (1574 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The mean (99% CI) values during treatment (nonbaseline) for triglycerides was 119.98 mg/dL (98.58–141.39 mg/dL); for total cholesterol, 184.74 mg/dL (178.17–191.31 mg/dL); for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 109.23 mg/dL (103.68–114.79 mg/dL); for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 42.80 mg/dL (39.84–45.76 mg/dL); for aspartate aminotransferase, 22.67 U/L (19.94–25.41 U/L); for alanine aminotransferase, 21.77 U/L (18.96–24.59 U/L); for alkaline phosphatase, 88.35 U/L (58.94–117.76 U/L); and for white blood cell count, 6890/µL (5700/µL-8030/µL). This meta-analysis showed that (1) isotretinoin is associated with a statistically significant change in the mean value of several laboratory tests (white blood cell count and hepatic and lipid panels), yet (2) the mean changes across a patient group did not meet a priori criteria for high-risk and (3) the proportion of patients with laboratory abnormalities was low.

Conclusions and Relevance

The evidence from this study does not support monthly laboratory testing for use of standard doses of oral isotretinoin for the standard patient with acne.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### The use of oral antibiotics before isotretinoin therapy in patients with acne [^114jZnRc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic antibiotics are used widely to treat moderate to severe acne, but increasing antibiotic resistance makes appropriate use a priority.

Objective

We sought to determine the duration of systemic antibiotic use in patients with inflammatory/nodulocystic acne who eventually required isotretinoin.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-site chart review of patients with acne diagnostic codes evaluated January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2014, at a dermatology practice in an academic medical center. Included patients were prescribed isotretinoin during the study period and received 30 days or more of antibiotics.

Results

The average duration of antibiotic use was 331.3 days. In all, 21 patients (15.3%) were prescribed antibiotics for 3 months or less, 88 patients (64.2%) for 6 months or more, and 46 patients (33.6%) for 1 year or longer. Patients treated only at the study site had a mean duration of antibiotic treatment of 283.1 days whereas patients who also received antibiotics from another institution had a mean duration of 380.2 days. This difference approached statistical significance (P = 0.054).

Limitations

This study was limited to a single center.

Conclusion

Expert guidelines recommend responsible use of antibiotics in acne in light of emerging resistance. We found that patients who eventually received isotretinoin had extended exposure to antibiotics, exceeding recommendations. Early recognition of antibiotic failure and the need for isotretinoin can curtail antibiotic use.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113j4Wv8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — use in acne and acne fulminans: Low-dose prednisone in doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg daily, administered alone or with high-estrogen containing COCs, has shown efficacy in the treatment of acne and seborrhea; however, long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids prohibit use as a primary therapy for acne. Prednisone in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day is indicated for treatment of the systemic and cutaneous manifestations of acne fulminans and for treatment and prevention of isotretinoin-induced acne fulminans–like eruptions, and a slow taper over several months is recommended while transitioning to isotretinoin or oral antibiotics in order to minimize relapses.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^113eHCtC]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Important controversies associated with isotretinoin therapy for acne [^112SNqF1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin is a remarkably effective drug for severe, recalcitrant acne vulgaris. Soon after the drug's release in the early 1980s, a number of important adverse effects were reported subsequently leading to a variety of medical and medicolegal controversies. Three of these controversies will be highlighted concerning the putative role of isotretinoin in (1) depression and suicide, (2) inflammatory bowel disease, and (3) iPledge and pregnancy prevention programs. It appears that a very small subset of patients receiving isotretinoin for acne are at risk for depression, which is very manageable provided there is adequate patient awareness of the possibility, maximum communication between the patient and physician, and cessation of therapy if clinically important depression occurs (after which the depression rapidly resolves in a week or less). Multiple controlled studies actually suggest a very favorable effect of isotretinoin on depression and anxiety common in the population requiring isotretinoin. With regard to inflammatory bowel disease, in just one study, only ulcerative colitis association with isotretinoin reached statistical significance. The actual incidence of this association is strikingly low. Finally, it is clear that even the most recent pregnancy prevention program (iPledge) is no more successful than prior programs; there will likely always be a small number of female patients becoming pregnant while receiving isotretinoin for acne vulgaris.

### Acne relapse and isotretinoin retrial in patients with acne [^1176HoXw]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Isotretinoin is the only medical acne treatment capable of inducing acne remission; however, some patients experience acne relapse and require retrials of isotretinoin. There is a need to understand who is most at risk and how daily dose and cumulative dosage can influence outcomes.

Objective

To assess rates of acne relapse and isotretinoin retrial and to identify associated factors among patients with acne who received an isotretinoin treatment course.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data from the MarketScan commercial claims database from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, to identify patients with acne who were 12 years or older and had received isotretinoin for 4 months or longer, with at least 1 year of continuous enrollment after completion of isotretinoin. Data analyses were performed from June 30, 2024, to August 1, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify associations of patient demographic and treatment characteristics with acne relapse and isotretinoin retrial.

Results

A total of 19 907 patients (mean [SD] age, 20.6 [7.8] years; 10 504 females [52.8%]) were included, among whom 4482 (22.5%) had acne relapse and 1639 (8.2%) had isotretinoin retrial. Female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.35–1.52) was significantly associated with increased rates of acne relapse, and isotretinoin cumulative dosage (mg/kg) was associated with a decreased rate of acne relapse (HR, 0.996; 95% CI, 0.995–0.997). Furthermore, daily dose was not associated with decreased risk of acne relapse or isotretinoin retrial among those with conventional and high cumulative dosages. Female sex (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62–0.76) and isotretinoin cumulative dosage (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99) were associated with decreased rates of isotretinoin retrial. Stratification by cumulative dosage indicated that higher cumulative dosage was associated with decreased rates of retrial among patients with low (< 120 mg/kg) and conventional (120–220 mg/kg), but not high (> 220 mg/kg) cumulative dosage. Maximum daily dose (mg/kg/d) was not negatively associated with acne relapse or isotretinoin retrial in patients with cumulative dosage of 120 mg/kg or more.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that higher cumulative dosage may potentially reduce risk of acne relapse and isotretinoin retrial. Furthermore, daily dose was not associated with decreased risk of the outcomes for conventional and high cumulative dosage; therefore, daily dosing could be individualized to patient goals and preferences.

### The clinical utility of laboratory monitoring during isotretinoin therapy for acne and changes to monitoring practices over time [^115n9ZKy]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

As a result of concerns about hypertriglyceridemia, liver enzyme abnormalities, and leukopenia during isotretinoin therapy for acne, patients are often monitored closely with routine laboratory assessments, although the value of this practice has been questioned.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of patients receiving isotretinoin for acne between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2017, using the OptumInsights Electronic Health Record Database (Optum, Eden Prairie, MN) to evaluate the frequency of laboratory abnormalities. Poisson regression was used to evaluate for changes to the frequency of routine laboratory monitoring over time.

Results

Among 1863 patients treated with isotretinoin, grade 3 or greater triglyceride and liver function testing abnormalities were noted in fewer than 1% and 0.5% of patients screened, respectively. No grade 3 or greater cholesterol or complete blood count abnormalities were observed. There were no meaningful changes in the frequency of laboratory monitoring over time.

Limitations

Limitations include that we are unable to evaluate the clinical notes to understand the exact clinical decision making when clinicians encountered abnormal laboratory values.

Conclusion

Although laboratory abnormalities are rare and often do not influence management, frequent laboratory monitoring remains a common practice. There are opportunities to improve the quality of care among patients being treated with isotretinoin for acne by reducing the frequency of lipid and liver function monitoring and by eliminating complete blood count monitoring.

### Isotretinoin updates [^113D8NFA]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of pilosebaceous follicles commonly affecting adolescents and young adults. This disease has a profound psychological impact on affected individuals and treatment has been shown to significantly improve both self-esteem and quality of life. Isotretinoin is an effective medication used primarily in severe cystic acne patients. Over the past 30 years, this medication has revolutionized the treatment of acne. However, despite its popularity there are numerous side effects associated with its use. Most of its side effects are predictable and dose dependent, which has led to the development of variable dose regimens. Unfortunately, rare but significant side effects (e.g., depression, inflammatory bowel disease) do occur and necessitate careful monitoring to improve clinical outcomes and minimize potential adverse events.

### Association of race / ethnicity and sex with differences in health care use and treatment for acne [^113ZtYmY]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Our understanding of potential racial/ethnic, sex, and other differences in health care use and treatment for acne is limited.

Objective

To identify potential disparities in acne care by evaluating factors associated with health care use and specific treatments for acne.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used the Optum deidentified electronic health record data set to identify patients treated for acne from January 1, 2007, to June 30, 2017. Patients had at least 1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code for acne and at least 1 year of continuous enrollment after the first diagnosis of acne. Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2019, to November 20, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable regression was used to quantify associations between basic patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the outcomes of health care use and treatment for acne during 1 year of follow-up.

Results

A total of 29 928 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 20.2 [15.4–34.9] years; 19 127 [63.9%] female; 20 310 [67.9%] white) met the inclusion criteria for the study. Compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic black patients were more likely to be seen by a dermatologist (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09–1.31) but received fewer prescriptions for acne medications (incidence rate ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.95). Of the acne treatment options, non-Hispanic black patients were more likely to receive prescriptions for topical retinoids (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.14–1.38) and topical antibiotics (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.21–1.52) and less likely to receive prescriptions for oral antibiotics (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.87), spironolactone (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49–0.94), and isotretinoin (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23–0.65) than non-Hispanic white patients. Male patients were more likely to be prescribed isotretinoin than female patients (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 2.01–2.95). Compared with patients with commercial insurance, those with Medicaid were less likely to see a dermatologist (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.41–0.52) or to be prescribed topical retinoids (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92), oral antibiotics (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79–0.97), spironolactone (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.80), and isotretinoin (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25–0.75).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings identify racial/ethnic, sex, and insurance-based differences in health care use and prescribing patterns for acne that are independent of other sociodemographic factors and suggest potential disparities in acne care. In particular, the study found underuse of systemic therapies among racial/ethnic minorities and isotretinoin among female patients with acne. Further study is needed to confirm and understand the reasons for these differences.

### Isotretinoin [^1135UsEA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Isotretinoin capsules are indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in non-pregnant patients 12 years of age and older with multiple inflammatory nodules with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. Because of significant adverse reactions associated with its use, isotretinoin capsules are reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics.

Limitations of Use:

If a second course of isotretinoin capsules therapy is needed, it is not recommended before a two-month waiting period because the patient's acne may continue to improve following a 15 to 20-week course of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Isotretinoin laboratory monitoring in acne treatment: a Delphi consensus study [^112tuEAk]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Although isotretinoin may rarely be associated with laboratory abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridemia, the optimal approach to laboratory monitoring is uncertain, and there is wide variation in clinical practice.

Objective

To establish a consensus for isotretinoin laboratory monitoring among a diverse, international cohort of clinical and research experts in acne.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Using a modified electronic Delphi process, 4 rounds of anonymous electronic surveys were administered from 2021 to 2022. For laboratory tests reaching consensus (≥ 70% agreement) for inclusion, questions regarding more time-specific monitoring throughout isotretinoin therapy were asked in subsequent rounds. The participants were international board-certified dermatologist acne experts who were selected on a voluntary basis based on involvement in acne-related professional organizations and research.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measured was whether participants could reach consensus on key isotretinoin laboratory monitoring parameters.

Results

The 22 participants from 5 continents had a mean (SD) time in practice of 23.7 (11.6) years and represented a variety of practice settings. Throughout the 4-round study, participation rates ranged from 90% to 100%. Consensus was achieved for the following: check alanine aminotransferase within a month prior to initiation (89.5%) and at peak dose (89.5%) but not monthly (76.2%) or after treatment completion (73.7%); check triglycerides within a month prior to initiation (89.5%) and at peak dose (78.9%) but not monthly (84.2%) or after treatment completion (73.7%); do not check complete blood cell count or basic metabolic panel parameters at any point during isotretinoin treatment (all > 70%); do not check gamma-glutamyl transferase (78.9%), bilirubin (81.0%), albumin (72.7%), total protein (72.7%), low-density lipoprotein (73.7%), high-density lipoprotein (73.7%), or C-reactive protein (77.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

This Delphi study identified a core set of laboratory tests that should be evaluated prior to and during treatment with isotretinoin. These results provide valuable data to guide clinical practice and clinical guideline development to optimize laboratory monitoring in patients treated with isotretinoin.

### Acne, isotretinoin and depression [^116Ue4f4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

At any one time, most 16–18-years-old and up to half of adults have acne. In 60% of all teenagers, the condition will be sufficiently severe for them to self-treat or seek medical advice. Up to half of 12–20-year-olds with acne develop psychological or social problems. Oral isotretinoin, which is used for the treatment of severe acne, might be expected to improve psychological functioning. However, there have been suggestions that the drug itself might cause depression and suicide. Here we consider these concerns, and the implications for the use of isotretinoin when managing patients of all ages.

### Standardized laboratory monitoring with use of isotretinoin in acne [^114CzmY7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Laboratory monitoring for adverse effects to isotretinoin occurs with variability. Standardization of laboratory monitoring practices represents an opportunity to improve quality of care.

Objective

We sought to develop an evidence-based approach to laboratory monitoring of patients receiving isotretinoin therapy for acne.

Methods

We reviewed laboratory data from 515 patients with acne undergoing 574 courses of isotretinoin from March 2003 to July 2011. Frequency, timing, and severity of abnormalities were determined.

Results

Clinically insignificant leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurred in 1.4% and 0.9% of patients, respectively. Elevated liver transaminases were detected infrequently and not significantly increased compared with baseline detection rates (1.9% vs 1.6% at baseline). Significant elevations occurred with triglyceride (19.3%) and cholesterol (22.8%) levels. The most severe abnormalities were grade 2 (moderate). Mean duration of treatment before abnormalities were detected was 56.3 days for hypertriglyceridemia, 61.9 days for alanine transaminitis, and 50.1 days for hypercholesterolemia.

Limitations

This was a single-center experience examining variable isotretinoin laboratory monitoring practices.

Conclusions

In healthy patients with normal baseline lipid panel and liver function test results, repeated studies should be performed after 2 months of isotretinoin therapy. If findings are normal, no further testing may be required. Routine complete blood cell count monitoring is not recommended.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^1154wBTF]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne

Sotret is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. "Severe", by definition,2means "many" as opposed to "few or several" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Sotret should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, Sotret is indicated only for those female patients who are not pregnant, because Sotret can cause severe birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).

A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients.1,3,4If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin capsules. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure).

### Isotretinoin for acne in transgender and gender-diverse individuals receiving masculinizing hormone therapy [^114kHL1r]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Masculinizing gender-affirming hormonal therapy is associated with the development of acne. While isotretinoin is a highly effective acne treatment, little is known about its effectiveness and safety among transgender and gender-diverse individuals receiving gender-affirming hormonal therapy.

Objective

To evaluate clinical outcomes of isotretinoin among transgender and gender-diverse individuals receiving gender-affirming hormonal therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter retrospective case series study was conducted at 4 medical centers: Mass General Brigham, University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, and Fenway Health. It included patients aged between 12 and 49 years who were receiving masculinizing gender-affirming hormonal therapy and prescribed isotretinoin for the management of acne between August 14, 2015, and September 20, 2023.

Exposure

Isotretinoin therapy for the management of acne.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The percentage of patients experiencing improvement or clearance of acne, as well as rates of acne recurrence. Adverse effects and reasons for treatment discontinuation were also evaluated.

Results

Among 55 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 25.4 years; 4 (7.3%) were Asian, 2 (3.6%) were Black, 4 (7.2%) were Hispanic, 1 was (1.8%) multiracial, and 36 (65.5%) were White. The median isotretinoin course duration was 6 months (IQR, 4.0–8.0), with a median cumulative dose of 132.7 mg/kg (IQR, 66.4–168.5); the cumulative dose was less than 90 mg/kg for 16 patients (29.1%) and less than 120 mg/kg for 22 patients (40.0%). Isotretinoin was associated with improvement in 48 patients (87.3%) and clearance in 26 patients (47.3%). For the 33 patients treated with a cumulative dose of 120 mg/kg or more, these rates increased to 32 patients (97.0%) and 21 patients (63.6%), respectively. Among the 20 patients who achieved acne clearance and had any subsequent health care encounters, the risk of recurrence was 20.0% (n = 4). The most frequently reported adverse effects were dryness (n = 44; 80.0%), joint pain (n = 8; 14.5%), and eczema (n = 5; 9.1%). Laboratory abnormalities were uncommon. Reasons for premature treatment discontinuation included cost, pharmacy issues, adverse effects, logistical reasons (scheduling), and wound healing concerns for gender-affirming surgery.

Conclusion and Relevance

In this case series study of individuals with acne who were receiving masculinizing gender-affirming hormonal therapy and underwent isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin was often effective and well tolerated. However, premature treatment discontinuation was common and associated with poorer outcomes. Further efforts are needed to understand optimal dosing and treatment barriers to improve outcomes in transgender and gender-diverse individuals receiving masculinizing gender-affirming hormonal therapy.

### Isotretinoin and adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes: retrospective cohort study using routine data [^111eTpzX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

To indirectly capture the severity of acne symptoms, we defined three different patient populations as control cohorts for the isotretinoin treatment cohort. First, 44 748 patients were included in the oral antibiotics (erythromycins/macrolides or tetracyclines) cohort of patients who did not have dispensed prescriptions for isotretinoin. Second, 108 367 patients were included in the topical anti‐acne cohort of patients who did not have dispensed prescriptions for isotretinoin or for the selected oral antibiotics (erythromycins or tetracyclines). Third, 78 666 patients were included in the acne control cohort of patients who did not have dispensed prescriptions for isotretinoin, any topical anti‐acne agents or for the selected oral antibiotics. For isotretinoin, oral antibiotics and topical anti‐acne agents, we used the first dispensed prescription in the data as the index prescription; whereas for the third control cohort we used the first healthcare visit because of acne as the index event.

### Mood changes and clinical decision making in adolescent patients on isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris [^113wvWt7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although numerous studies have demonstrated no causal relationship between isotretinoin and depression or suicide, subtle mood changes and idiosyncratic mood symptoms have been reported in patients on isotretinoin treatment for acne vulgaris, and few studies have described the full range of mood symptoms and clinical course after a mood change arises. We reviewed 247 patients, ages 10–25years, with acne vulgaris on isotretinoin and found that 26/247 (10.5%) patients experienced mood changes, the most common being depressive symptoms, anxiety, aggression, and emotional lability. Regardless of treatment management, 22/25 (88%) patients experienced improvement of mood symptoms to baseline, and 22/25 (88%) were able to complete their isotretinoin course without symptom recurrence. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring for a broad range of mood changes in patients on isotretinoin, especially those related to a pre-existing mood disorder and including those which do not meet formal criteria for a psychiatric disorder.

Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne

Claravis (isotretinoin capsules) is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. "Severe", by definition,2means "many" as opposed to "few or several" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Claravis should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, Claravis is indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because Claravis can cause life threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).

A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients.1,3,4If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off Claravis. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS, Skeletal, Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, Premature Epiphyseal Closure).

### Making the case for early treatment of acne [^116LMfvF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Early acne can be defined as the occurrence of acne at its onset, primarily in preteens, or as acne at its earliest severity (ie, mild to moderate). Although the majority of patients with acne are treated by dermatologists, most, particularly mild to moderate cases, could be successfully managed by primary care physicians. Therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits of treating all types of acne, not just the most severe. Awareness of the emotional impact of acne, particularly in adolescence, as well as recognition of possible scarring are important considerations. To achieve optimal results, physicians should be familiar with classification and severity grading of acne. Also, in-depth knowledge of available acne medications will streamline and optimize treatment regimens. Recognizing, treating, and monitoring the progress of early acne may lead to quicker, better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^112WEAPf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric and sexual dysfunction adverse effects are the focus of an Expert Working Group of the Commission on Human Medicines report and have led to new MHRA guidance. The effect of isotretinoin on mood remains controversial; new population based studies have not shown an increased risk of suicide, however, there are reports of individual distressing cases. The MHRA has recommended better provision of information to patients regarding possible risk of mental health and sexual function adverse effects; standardised assessment of mental health prior to starting and improved monitoring for adverse effects while on treatment. Patients under the age of 18 years require two health professionals to agree their acne is severe and that isotretinoin is the most appropriate treatment before initiation of isotretinoin therapy. The aim of these changes is to improve the safety of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne.

New compulsory risk minimisation materials have been developed including an Acknowledgement of Risk form for all patients (which includes the PPP for appropriate patients), a Patient Reminder Card and a Pharmacist checklist. These materials are produced and circulated by the Market Authorisation holders. Patient information and other supporting and training resources are freely available on the British Association of Dermatologists Isotretinoin Clinical Resources webpage.

In the future, new studies are needed to further investigate these potential adverse effects, including the effect of a reduced isotretinoin dose on effectiveness and reduction of potential harms.

Management of acne in skin of colour

The NICE guidance does not provide different treatment recommendations for acne in skin of colour. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring are more frequent and a particular concern for people with skin of colour and acne, and both atrophic and keloid scarring have been reported to be more common. It is important to avoid significant irritation with acne treatments, as this can worsen hyperpigmentation, but topical retinoids and azelaic acid can help both acne and hyperpigmentation.

Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) is a retinoid that has been used over the past 2 decades to treat a wide variety of dermatologic conditions, some with great success. Although it is beneficial in many skin conditions, the side effects and toxicities of oral retinoids require careful monitoring by experienced physicians. The clinical applications of oral retinoids continue to expand both within and beyond the field of dermatology.

### Medication and medical service utilization for acne 1995–1998 [^113W88DJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Acne occurs in most persons sometime during adolescence or early adulthood and is a frequent reason for visits to dermatologists and for prescription drug therapy.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to analyze changes in the utilization of physician services and medications for the treatment of acne.

Methods

An analysis was performed of data from two US federal surveys of outpatient physician services and prescribing for the years 1980 to 1997 and two commercial sources of drug prescription data for 1996 to 1998. From these data, I estimated visits for acne and drugs prescribed during these visits.

Results

Visits for women principally for acne are about 80% more frequent than those for men. Each year 5 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics and 1.4 million prescriptions for isotretinoin are dispensed for the treatment of acne.

Conclusion

Substantial health care resources are devoted to the treatment of acne, with women particularly likely to continue to frequently utilize these services after 19 years of age.

### Isotretinoin (Amnesteem) [^1178ihXn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne

Amnesteem is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. "Severe", by definition,2means "many" as opposed to "few or several" nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Amnesteem should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. In addition, Amnesteem is indicated only for those patients who are not pregnant, because Amnesteem can cause life threatening birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS).

A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients.1,3,4If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off Amnesteem. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, Premature Epiphyseal Closure).

### Isotretinoin and adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes: retrospective cohort study using routine data [^1169erJp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite concerns over isotretinoin‐induced idiosyncratic adverse effects, research aiming to identify potentially vulnerable patients is lacking. Being exposed to large amounts of vitamin A is known to have neurotoxic effects, but the ability of the therapeutic doses of isotretinoin typically used in treating acne to induce severe acute psychiatric symptoms has not been established. This could be partly because the focus has been on the direct effects of isotretinoin on psychiatric outcomes, such as on isotretinoin‐induced primary depression. Interaction between acne‐related symptoms and the relatively common physical and neurological side‐effects of isotretinoin has rarely been examined as a potential mechanism for idiosyncratic neuropsychiatric adverse outcomes associated with isotretinoin. For example, a bidirectional association between headache and depression has been established, and co‐occurring headache and depression has also been reported among patients treated with isotretinoin.

We observed that patients treated with isotretinoin significantly more often experienced incident physical symptoms than patients with acne receiving other types of treatment or no treatment with acne prescription medicines. An increased graded association by the severity of acne was observed for these physical symptoms. Acne‐related psychosocial stress in general or pre‐existing subclinical mental health problems together with an initial acne flare‐up or other isotretinoin‐induced physical side‐effects may trigger clinically relevant mental health symptoms in patients already vulnerable because of their severe acne, particularly among patients with limited coping and emotional resilience. Research on stressful life events has shown that even relatively minor and low‐intensity life events and experiences can trigger clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression in vulnerable individuals. Similar mechanisms of underlying sustained and accumulated acne‐related psychological burden may contribute to an increased vulnerability of clinically relevant mental health problems among patients who experience added psychological burden because of acute isotretinoin‐induced physical or neurological side‐effects. Therefore, it can be suggested that psychosocial vulnerability in general, pre‐existing subclinical mental health problems, physical comorbidity, subjective and objective burden of acne symptoms, age at onset and duration of acne symptoms, and the frequency and intensity of isotretinoin‐induced physical and neurological side‐effects, all contribute to the risk of adverse mental health outcomes during isotretinoin treatment. In practice, therefore, the physical side‐effects of the medication should also be considered during isotretinoin treatment; and if appropriate, the dose reduced, particularly in patients with mental health symptoms. Future observational research should aim to establish the potential role of common physical and neurological side‐effects as mediators for adverse mental health outcomes during isotretinoin treatment.

### Non-acne dermatologic indications for systemic isotretinoin [^117MkMLv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Systemic isotretinoin has been used to treat severe acne vulgaris for 20 years. However, isotretinoin also represents a potentially useful choice of drugs in many dermatologic diseases other than acne vulgaris. Diseases such as psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, condylomata acuminata, skin cancers, rosacea, hidradenitis suppurativa, granuloma annulare, lupus erythematosus and lichen planus have been shown to respond to the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities of the drug. Isotretinoin also helps prevent skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. A combination of systemic isotretinoin and interferon-alpha-2a may provide a more potent effect than isotretinoin alone in the prevention and treatment of skin cancers. Systemic isotretinoin may be considered as an alternative drug in some dermatologic diseases unresponsive to conventional treatment modalities. However, randomized clinical trials aimed at determining the role of systemic isotretinoin therapy in dermatologic diseases other than acne vulgaris are required.

### Isotretinoin monitoring trends: a national survey of dermatologists [^115LFhfv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin is an effective treatment for nodulocystic acne. Outside of required pregnancy testing, laboratory monitoring suggested by the manufacturers is vague. Dermatologists, therefore, monitor a variety of tests with variable frequency. Despite intense monitoring, the majority of patients do not have gross laboratory abnormalities that warrant changes in management. OBJECTIVE: To survey US dermatologists regarding laboratory monitoring practices while prescribing isotretinoin. METHODS: An online survey sent via e-mail to members of the American Academy of Dermatology. RESULTS: 12,396 surveys were sent with a response rate of ~19%. At baseline > 60% of responders check a CBC, LFTs, and a lipid panel. 74% check a monthly lipid panel and LFTs, while 57% check a monthly CBC. 75% report stopping isotretinoin when AST or ALT values reach 3 times normal; 89% report stopping at 4 times normal. When triglycerides reach 4 times normal, 72% stop the medication. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus on isotretinoin monitoring tests and frequency, though the majority of dermatologists surveyed monitor a lipid panel and LFTs.

### Isotretinoin therapy and the incidence of acne relapse: a nested case-control study [^115v56RN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies on predictors of acne relapse in patients treated with isotretinoin had either small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, or lacked population-based data.

Objectives

To identify and quantify predictors of acne relapse, and predictors of receiving a second isotretinoin treatment.

Methods

Using the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and Quebec's hospital discharge (Med-Echo) administrative databases, a population-based cohort of 17 351 first-time isotretinoin users was assembled between 1984 and 2003. A nested case-control analysis was performed to determine predictors of acne relapse (as defined by receiving an antiacne medication). A second nested case-control analysis was performed to determine predictors of receiving a second isotretinoin treatment. The index date of cases was the calendar date of dispensing an antiacne medication (isotretinoin or other). Five controls were matched to each case on follow-up time. Rate ratios were estimated using conditional logistic regression.

Results

A total of 7100 (41%) subjects experienced an acne relapse. These were matched to 35 500 controls. Being male, under 16 years of age and living in an urban area, and receiving isotretinoin cumulative doses greater than 2450 mg and an isotretinoin treatment longer than 121 days were statistically associated (P < 0.05) with acne relapse. The publishing of the different Canadian acne guidelines had no impact on the incidence of acne relapse (P > 0.05). A total of 4443 (26%) subjects required a second isotretinoin treatment. These were matched to 22 215 controls. There was a greater probability of receiving a second isotretinoin treatment after the publishing of the Canadian acne guidelines (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

A relatively high rate of subjects experienced an acne relapse after an isotretinoin treatment.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^115WGumd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, 0.3% A/BPO may fill a gap as a single-agent treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Pediatric guidelines recommend that an oral antibiotic be started concomitantly with topical combination therapy (i.e. topical retinoid and BPO) promptly to prevent scarring in severe acne, when there is evidence of scarring even in moderate acne, or as a step-up regimen if initial therapeutic response with topical therapy is not adequate. European guidance suggests that for moderate acne, an oral antibiotic should be initiated upon the presentation of more widespread disease. Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be able to substitute antibiotics in the interest of minimizing antibiotic resistance in cases where the addition of systemic antibiotic therapy is considered, particularly as its mechanism of action includes prevention of microcomedone formation. International guidelines for acne management stipulate that oral isotretinoin remains the gold standard for severe acne treatment. Recent guidance for the pediatric population suggests that oral isotretinoin is no longer indicated as first-line treatment, but instead only after inadequate response with initial treatment using combination therapy (topical treatment associated with oral antibiotic). Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be an appropriate treatment, alone or in combination with other therapies, prior to the potential need for step-up treatment to oral isotretinoin, or while enrolling the patient in the required programs to obtain access to oral isotretinoin. Furthermore, 0.3% A/BPO may be seen as a replacement for existing topical combination therapies used with oral antibiotics in not only moderate acne but also in severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne (although, perhaps not exclusively).

### Treating acne in transgender persons receiving testosterone: a practical guide [^112pjsAg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Transgender persons who undergo masculinizing hormone therapy experience a wide array of dermatologic effects as they initiate and maintain testosterone therapy. Acne is one of the most common adverse effects for many transmasculine patients receiving testosterone. Acne can worsen body image and mental health, with significant impact on quality of life in transgender patients. Specific training and awareness are needed for a clinically and culturally competent encounter while providing care for the transgender patient. This article provides a practical guide for the treatment of testosterone-induced acne in transmasculine patients. Recommendations on creating a welcoming clinical setting, taking a gender-inclusive history, and conducting a patient-centered physical examination relevant to acne care are provided. Assessment of reproductive potential and the appropriate contraceptive methods before prescribing acne treatment with teratogenic potential in transmasculine patients are examined. Interactions between acne treatments with gender-affirming therapies are explored. For patients with severe or treatment-refractory acne, indications, contraindications, and barriers to isotretinoin prescription, such as the US iPLEDGE program, are examined. Multidisciplinary approaches to acne care, involving mental health, reproductive health, gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgeries, are adopted to guide isotretinoin treatment.

### Risk of new-onset inflammatory bowel disease among patients with acne vulgaris exposed to isotretinoin [^115dneWE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among isotretinoin-exposed patients with acne vulgaris (AV) is controversial.

Objective

To compare IBD risk in isotretinoin-exposed and unexposed patients with AV.

Methods

Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with AV with and without isotretinoin exposure identified using electronic health records. Primary outcomes were 6-month and 1-year IBD incidence.

Results

The crude 6-month IBD incidence was 0.08% (21/27,230) among isotretinoin-exposed patients with AV compared to 0.04% (254/631,089) among those unexposed. The crude 1-year IBD incidence was 0.10% (28/27,230) among isotretinoin exposed patients with AV and 0.08% (477/631,089) among those unexposed. The odds of developing IBD within 6 months were 87% higher among isotretinoin-exposed patients with AV compared to those unexposed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–2.93), although the absolute difference was small (risk difference, 2.6 more cases per 10,000 patients; 95% CI, 0.7–4.5). There was no significant difference in the odds of developing IBD at 1 year between isotretinoin-exposed and unexposed patients with AV (adjusted odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.95–2.05).

Limitations

Isotretinoin-exposed patients may be more likely to have IBD detected by a health care provider.

Conclusions

IBD incidence among isotretinoin-exposed patients with AV is very low, and the risk appears similar to that for unexposed patients with AV.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111QKHzm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — procedural timing, infection risk, and pregnancy precautions are outlined as follows: Early case series described delayed wound healing or keloid formation with isotretinoin, leading to a recommendation to delay dermabrasion or laser resurfacing until 6 to 12 months after discontinuation; recent small prospective studies did not find atypical scarring with chemical peels or manual dermabrasion, and retrospective studies and case reports demonstrate safety with laser hair removal, pulsed dye laser, and CO2 laser; however, elective procedures should be delayed for 6 to 12 months when possible, with case-by-case consideration. Higher rates of S aureus colonization have been seen with systemic isotretinoin, increasing minor skin infections, and the combination of cheilitis and S aureus colonization can cause lip or perioral abscesses requiring prompt attention. Despite FDA-mandated iPLEDGE enrollment, fetal exposure has not significantly decreased since iPLEDGE, with approximately 150 isotretinoin-exposed pregnancies in the United States each year; nearly one-third of women of child-bearing potential in a US study admitted noncompliance with iPLEDGE pregnancy prevention, including 29% not complying with condom use and 39% missing ≥ 1 contraceptive pill in the prior month. Every woman of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be carefully counseled regarding available contraceptive methods and iPLEDGE requirements at each clinic visit, and patient-independent forms of birth control, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, should be considered whenever appropriate.

### A propensity score matched cohort study identifying an association of acne, but not oral antibiotic or isotretinoin use, with risk of incident inflammatory bowel disease [^113oCXFH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns remain regarding whether oral antibiotic or isotretinoin use for acne is associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); little is known about whether acne itself is associated with IBD.

Objective

To determine whether isotretinoin exposure, oral tetracycline-class antibiotic exposure, and/or acne itself are associated with IBD.

Methods

A propensity score matched cohort study was performed using TriNetX between 2001 and 2022 to compare the 1-year incidence of IBD between those without acne compared to those with acne managed without systemic medications, acne managed with oral tetracycline-class antibiotics, and acne managed with isotretinoin.

Results

There was a statistically significant association between acne and risk of incident IBD (odds ratio: 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.65). There was no statistically significant association between oral tetracycline-class antibiotic or isotretinoin exposure and IBD.

Limitations

Use of electronic health data; potential for misclassification bias.

Conclusion

This matched cohort study identifies an association between acne and IBD. These data provide further reassurance regarding the use of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne.

### Family physicians are well suited to prescribe isotretinoin… [^1157PLqG]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

In a busy practice, physicians may be discouraged by the prospect of having to log onto yet another website or navigate more protocols to carry out patient care. However, a few extra minutes can open up rewarding therapeutic opportunities when registering with iPledge to prescribe isotretinoin. Isotretinoin was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 1982 for the treatment of severe, recalcitrant nodular acne and has the potential to cure acne. 1 Family physicians are no strangers to prescribing medications with risks. They are well suited to monitor the laboratory, contraceptive, and adverse effect considerations associated with isotretinoin. Although patients can be referred to multiple subspecialists, this results in increased health care costs and fragmented care. Isotretinoin is a vitamin A derivative that acts on retinoid receptors.

It has an antiproliferative effect on sebaceous glands and reduces Propionibacterium acnes colonization and inflammation. 1 There is no age restriction, and it is typically taken twice daily with a starting dosage of 0. 5 mg per kg per day. A cumulative treatment dose of 120 to 150 mg per kg is recommended. 2 Isotretinoin is expensive, but it is often approved by insurers after documentation of severe, recalcitrant nodular acne. Isotretinoin carries an FDA boxed warning for teratogenicity and may be associated with suicidal ideation and inflammatory bowel disease, although no causal relationship has been established. 1, 4, 5 A patient receiving isotretinoin should discontinue other acne medications — especially tetracycline antibiotics — because of the risk of pseudotumor cerebri. Other drug-drug interactions exist. Vitamin A supplementation should be avoided in patients receiving isotretinoin. Heavy alcohol use may reduce its effectiveness.

1.

Candidates for treatment are assigned an iPledge number, and the patient and physician must attest online that the patient is using two approved forms of contraceptive. Medications must not be shared, and blood should not be donated during treatment and for one month after treatment is completed. With more than 20 million persons treated with isotretinoin since 1982, the adverse effect profile is well known.

### Family physicians and accutane… [^113yuWTg]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Isotretinoin has proved to be extremely effective in these worst-case scenarios, often providing years of relief with a single course of medication. We can even use the word "cure" — not just "control" — to describe what happens when this medication is used. Despite many significant adverse effects, most patients who use isotretinoin are quite happy with the physical and psychologic benefits of treatment. 1 Isotretinoin is also cost-effective compared with conventional acne management. 2 Nonetheless, many family physicians still will not prescribe isotretinoin. Is this medication really that bad. Beyond the significant adverse effects that were well known at the time of its FDA labeling by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, more serious teratogenic effects became apparent in the mid-1980s. 3 These reports led to the Pregnancy Prevention Program for Women on Accutane developed by the manufacturer, Roche Laboratories, in 1988.

The Roche PPP was designed to be a comprehensive plan for preventing further teratogenic problems associated with the use of isotretinoin and for gathering information for future monitoring. The program provides educational materials for patients and physicians, and a detailed informed consent form. The essential elements of the program are designed to prevent any possibility of pregnancy occurring during a course of therapy with isotretinoin. While the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin are preventable with appropriate precautions, the other adverse effects are common but manageable. These issues are well reviewed in the article by Johnson and Nunley 5 in this issue of American Family Physician. The list can seem daunting and will doubtless scare many patients away from the medication. Nonetheless, these problems need not stop family physicians from prescribing an effective therapy.

Many patients needlessly suffer with nodulocystic acne when their family physician will not prescribe isotretinoin and access to a dermatologist is not possible. The protocol for prescribing this medicine need not be difficult. A PPP kit may be obtained from Roche Laboratories. Discussion about the drug may be initiated when trying the second or third oral antibiotic, and the "Proper Use of Accutane in Acne" patient education handout that accompanies the article. 5 in this issue can be given to the patient with the explanation that isotretinoin may be needed if the current medicines fail.

Clinical Question What are the most effective therapies for acne vulgaris. Bottom Line Oral isotretinoin was the most effective therapy for decreasing the number of lesions in patients with acne. However, oral isotretinoin is not considered first-line therapy. Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide combined with oral or topical antibiotics were comparably effective in achieving the assessment of treatment success. Another analysis suggested starting treatment with adapalene plus benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin plus benzoyl peroxide, or adapalene alone. Synopsis The ambitious, data-laden network meta-analysis sought to identify the most effective therapies for a condition that many think of as trivial or a rite of passage for adolescents. However, the psychological and cosmetic impacts make acne vulgaris an important condition for primary care physicians to properly manage.

The authors searched PubMed and Embase to identify randomized trials that assessed the effectiveness of therapies for acne. They included 210 papers with 65, 601 patients. The median duration of the studies was 12 weeks. The studies evaluated six oral antibiotics, five topical antibiotics, oral isotretinoin, five topical retinoids, six combined oral contraceptives, topical clascoterone, 10 combination therapies, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and placebo. The most common outcomes were disease-oriented inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, but 69 studies reported the investigators' global assessment of success. No study reported patients' self-assessments. Overall, the studies were of decent quality. Oral isotretinoin was the most effective agent at decreasing the number of lesions, followed by combination therapy.

For patients with inflammatory lesions, oral isotretinoin was also the most effective, followed by a combination of topical antibiotics plus azelaic acid. The effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives was inconsistent, possibly due to studies that included patients without hormonally sensitive acne.
