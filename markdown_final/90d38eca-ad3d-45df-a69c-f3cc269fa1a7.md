## Question

CKD management overview

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of CKD management, including how to define and classify CKD, approaches to initial evaluation and risk stratification, lifestyle interventions, pharmacologic strategies to slow progression, management of complications, medication safety and stewardship, and team-based care. They also want information on special populations, monitoring and follow-up, and implementation and quality improvement, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify CKD accurately. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation and risk stratification approach. Next, I will consider lifestyle interventions, followed by pharmacologic strategies to slow progression. After that, I need to address complication management, medication safety and stewardship, and team-based care. Finally, I should review special populations, monitoring and follow-up, and implementation and quality improvement, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification framework so I don't anchor on outdated constructs. CKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for at least 3 months, typically eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or markers of kidney damage such as albuminuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging, with implications for health, and the 2024 KDIGO update retains the cause–GFR–albuminuria (CGA) classification to refine risk stratification and guide management decisions [^117NcKTA].

> Wait, let me verify the staging and risk implications before moving on. The GFR categories G1–G5 and albuminuria categories A1–A3 are used to assign risk, and the presence of albuminuria independently increases risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality at any given GFR stage, which is why KDIGO emphasizes both GFR and albuminuria in risk prediction and management planning [^117NcKTA].

> I need to check the initial evaluation and risk assessment steps next. For patients at risk, I should obtain a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimate GFR, and when more accurate risk prediction is needed, I should confirm eGFR with a combined creatinine–cystatin C equation and consider validated risk tools such as the Kidney Failure Risk Equation for stages G3–G5 to guide follow-up intensity and referral decisions [^114MUoHU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should confirm the cause of CKD using history, serologies, and imaging as indicated, because identifying the underlying cause informs targeted therapy and prognosis. KDIGO 2024 continues to embed cause alongside GFR and albuminuria in the classification and management approach, reinforcing the need to document etiology explicitly [^117NcKTA].

> Next, I should review lifestyle interventions as the foundation of care. I need to ensure sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day, individualized protein intake often around 0.8 g/kg/day in non-dialysis CKD, weight optimization, smoking cessation, and physical activity tailored to cardiorespiratory fitness and fall risk, because these measures reduce blood pressure, albuminuria, and cardiovascular risk and may slow CKD progression [^114KV17y] [^115xpJJi].

> Let me consider pharmacologic strategies to slow progression, and I should double-check the hierarchy of evidence. First-line therapy includes ACE inhibitors or ARBs for patients with albuminuria, with careful monitoring for hyperkalemia and creatinine rises after initiation; SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended for many patients with CKD with or without diabetes given robust kidney and cardiovascular benefits; nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone are appropriate for type 2 diabetes with albuminuria; and GLP-1 receptor agonists provide additional cardiorenal benefits in type 2 diabetes, all layered on top of lifestyle measures [^113hL7bJ] [^114sMRip].

> I should confirm blood pressure targets and agents for patients without albuminuria. For most adults with CKD, a target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg is reasonable if tolerated, with lifestyle optimization plus medication, and when albuminuria is absent, alternatives such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide-like diuretics can be considered, while still individualizing based on comorbidity and tolerability [^117NcuD9] [^1132nt3y].

> Now, I will examine complication management, starting with CKD–mineral and bone disorder. I need to ensure phosphate control, maintain calcium in the normal range, and manage secondary hyperparathyroidism using trends rather than single values, avoiding hypercalcemia and adjusting vitamin D analogs and calcimimetics accordingly, with regular monitoring of calcium, phosphate, and PTH in stages G3a–G5 [^115ARtVm] [^112t3o5Z].

> For anemia, I should confirm iron-repletion strategies and when to consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Iron therapy is prioritized to achieve ferritin and transferrin saturation targets, and ESA therapy is reserved for selected patients after iron optimization, with ongoing attention to hemoglobin trends and avoidance of overly aggressive targets, aligning with KDIGO anemia guidance and contemporary updates [^116xKfSw].

> Hyperkalemia management requires an individualized approach. Let me think about dietary potassium restriction, loop diuretics when indicated, and potassium binders such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, tailoring to comorbidities and quality of life, and I should involve a renal dietitian for education and follow-up [^1112dv8u].

> I should also address metabolic acidosis, volume status, and dyslipidemia. Sodium bicarbonate can be considered for chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD, diuretics are used to manage volume overload, and statins are recommended for adults over 50 years with CKD to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, with risk estimation guiding intensity [^115dGtHR] [^1151fbA8].

> Next, I should review medication safety and stewardship because polypharmacy is common. I need to ensure dose adjustments for renal function, screen for nephrotoxins, and coordinate with pharmacists and other clinicians. Patient education on benefits and adverse effects is essential so patients can identify and report problems early, and when precision is needed, I should confirm dosing using creatinine- and cystatin C–based eGFR and consult renal dosing references [^116YrjNm] [^115UJH81] [^1153Xh7V].

> I will now examine team-based and patient-centered care, and I should confirm referral thresholds. Multidisciplinary care that includes dietary counseling, medication management, education on kidney replacement options, and psychosocial support is recommended, with nephrology co-management considered when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or when the 2-year kidney failure risk exceeds 40 percent, to prepare for complications and modality planning [^112gNvW4] [^115ouhJr].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has limited life expectancy. In older adults, I need to ensure that eGFR interpretation accounts for sarcopenia, prioritize quality of life, and align decisions with goals of care; for reproductive-age patients, I should discuss pregnancy planning and teratogenic medications; in children, I must use pediatric-appropriate equations and growth-focused management; and for people with limited access to dialysis, conservative kidney management and supportive care should be offered as active treatment pathways [^11627RcP] [^113kUJBa].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and key safety labs. Typically, eGFR and albuminuria are monitored every 3–6 months in stable patients, with shorter intervals after medication changes or during acute illnesses; electrolytes, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate, and PTH are monitored periodically based on stage, and I should reassess progression annually, escalating evaluation if there is a sustained eGFR decline greater than 5 mL/min/1.73 m² per year or a 25 percent drop in eGFR from baseline [^113zUTGV].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation and quality improvement levers because care gaps persist. Embedding eGFR and uACR reporting in routine workflows, using clinical decision support, and conducting regular audits against quality indicators can improve detection and guideline-concordant care; addressing social determinants of health and leveraging telehealth can expand access, and aligning with CKM frameworks helps integrate cardiometabolic risk reduction into routine CKD care [^1134FAym] [^111mx33o].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure coherence. The 2024 KDIGO guideline emphasizes a comprehensive, risk-stratified strategy anchored in lifestyle, evidence-based pharmacotherapies, proactive complication management, medication stewardship, and multidisciplinary care, with explicit attention to special populations and implementation science to translate evidence into improved outcomes for people with CKD [^114YYuwL].

CKD management centers on **early detection** with eGFR and albuminuria [^115hbXMR], **risk stratification** using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [^114MUoHU], and **blood pressure control** to < 130/80 mmHg with ACEi/ARBs for albuminuria [^114KV17y]. SGLT2 inhibitors are first-line for CKD with albuminuria, with GLP-1 RAs and MRAs added as indicated [^114sMRip] [^113hL7bJ]. Lifestyle measures include sodium restriction, plant-forward diets, weight management, and smoking cessation [^113FAqMC]. Monitor for complications — anemia, CKD-MBD, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis — and refer to nephrology when eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or ESKD risk > 40% at 2 years [^115ouhJr]. Use a **multidisciplinary team** and patient education to optimize adherence and outcomes [^112gNvW4] [^115rMqTN].

---

## Diagnosis and staging

- **Definition**: CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for ≥ 3 months, with implications for health [^117NcKTA].

- **Staging**: CKD is staged by eGFR (G1–G5) and albuminuria (A1–A3) categories, which guide risk stratification and management [^notfound].

- **Risk assessment**: Use validated tools such as the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) to predict progression to ESKD [^114MUoHU].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

- **Dietary management**: Sodium restriction (< 2 g/day), plant-forward diets, and moderation of protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day) are recommended [^notfound].

- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m² to reduce cardiovascular risk and slow CKD progression [^notfound].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to reduce cardiovascular and renal risk [^113FAqMC].

- **Physical activity**: Encourage at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, tailored to patient tolerance [^114KV17y].

---

## Pharmacological management

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line for patients with albuminuria [^1132nt3y].

- **Glycemic control**: For diabetic CKD, use metformin (if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists as indicated [^113hL7bJ].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Recommended for CKD with albuminuria, with or without diabetes, to reduce progression and cardiovascular events [^115dGtHR].

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Finerenone is recommended for CKD with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria [^notfound].

---

## Management of complications

| **Complication** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|
| Anemia | - Iron supplementation <br/> - Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents as indicated [^116xKfSw] |
| CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) | - Phosphate binders <br/> - Vitamin D analogs <br/> - Calcimimetics [^notfound] |
| Hyperkalemia | - Dietary potassium restriction <br/> - Potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) [^1112dv8u] |
| Metabolic acidosis | Sodium bicarbonate supplementation as indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **eGFR, albuminuria, blood pressure, electrolytes, and hemoglobin** is essential [^notfound]. Adjust the frequency of visits based on CKD stage, risk of progression, and patient stability [^notfound]. Provide education on self-management, medication adherence, and recognition of complications [^115rMqTN].

---

## Indications for nephrology referral

Refer when **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** or when the ESKD risk exceeds 40% at 2 years [^115ouhJr]. Also refer for **rapid progression of CKD**, refractory hypertension or electrolyte disturbances, or suspected hereditary kidney disease.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging directions include **antifibrotic agents** targeting kidney fibrosis, **personalized medicine** using genetic and biomarker-guided approaches, and **digital health** tools for remote monitoring and patient engagement [^115dGtHR] [^114RU2Gb].

---

CKD management requires a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** encompassing lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and regular monitoring to slow progression, manage complications, and improve patient outcomes [^113Qvizh].

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114GRPqv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: known knowns and known unknowns [^114YYuwL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

Conclusions

Clinical Practice Guidelines are increasingly issued by various stakeholders to promote quality of care. The KDIGO guideline on diagnosis and management of CKD has been adapted in many countries and served as model for most guidelines included in this review. There was substantial variation in the quality of the guideline development process.

Although there is good agreement on most core recommendations, the scope of recommendations issued by the guidelines varied significantly. Many recommendations for management of CKD relyprimarily on consensus. The care for CKD in multimorbid patients might require more individualization based on patient preferences and circumstances than can be reflected by guideline recommendations based primarily on measurement of kidney function. Since subtle differences can have a significant impact on health resource utilization and increase burden of disease in affected patients, careful implementation and evaluation of benefits and harms in every health care system is warranted.

### Early chronic kidney disease: diagnosis, management and models of care [^114BixjC]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in many countries, and the costs associated with the care of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are estimated to exceed US$1 trillion globally. The clinical and economic rationale for the design of timely and appropriate health system responses to limit the progression of CKD to ESRD is clear. Clinical care might improve if early-stage CKD with risk of progression to ESRD is differentiated from early-stage CKD that is unlikely to advance. The diagnostic tests that are currently used for CKD exhibit key limitations; therefore, additional research is required to increase awareness of the risk factors for CKD progression. Systems modelling can be used to evaluate the impact of different care models on CKD outcomes and costs. The US Indian Health Service has demonstrated that an integrated, system-wide approach can produce notable benefits on cardiovascular and renal health outcomes. Economic and clinical improvements might, therefore, be possible if CKD is reconceptualized as a part of primary care. This Review discusses which early CKD interventions are appropriate, the optimum time to provide clinical care, and the most suitable model of care to adopt.

### Quality of chronic kidney disease management in Canadian primary care [^1134FAym]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequently treated condition at health care systems, both globally and within Canada, with a prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population. Most patients with CKD are at low risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and are ideally managed in primary care settings. Organizations such as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the Canadian Society of Nephrologyprovide recommendations regarding the management of patients with CKD to reduce the risk of adverse consequences of ESKD and cardiovascular disease. Despite these guidelines, variability in care continues.

Regular quality audits at local, provincial or state, and national levels could identify variations in care and inform resource allocation, primary care physician training, education, and other quality improvement activities. Furthermore, assessment benchmarks for quality are the first step to evaluating innovations aimed at creating high-functioning and sustainable health systems. A few studies, have examined quality of care for patients with CKD in primary care settings using provincial (regional) data. To our knowledge, no studies have examined pan-Canadian performance in meeting quality-of-care indicators for CKD management in primary care, as has been done in other settings.,

National chronic disease surveillance systems, such as the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN), have been designed to facilitate national quality improvement studies to improve chronic disease management. Understanding data from Canadian primary care may indicate gaps in care processes and demonstrate a proof of concept for the use of CPCSSN data to inform targeted priorities for improvement in management of patients with chronic diseases. The key objectives of this study were to define the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices based on existing guidelines and to stratify key results by population demographics.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — definition and identification directives include: "Recognize that small fluctuations in GFR are common and are not necessarily indicative of progression. (Not Graded)". CKD progression is defined as "a drop in GFR category accompanied by a 25% or greater drop in eGFR from baseline", and "Rapid progression is defined as a sustained decline in eGFR of more than 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/yr". "The confidence in assessing progression is increased with increasing number of serum creatinine measurements and duration of follow-up". For people with CKD progression, "review current management, examine for reversible causes of progression, and consider referral to a specialist. (Not Graded)".

### The management of CKD: a look into the future [^114RU2Gb]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease with the associated spiraling cost has profound public health and economic implications. This has made slowing the progression of CKD, a major health-care priority. CKD is invariably characterized by progressive kidney fibrosis and at present, treatment aiming to slow the progression of CKD is limited to aggressive blood pressure control, with few therapies targeting the fibrotic process itself. In this review, we explore the potential of experimental therapeutic strategies, based on preventing or reversing the pathophysiologic steps of kidney remodeling that lead to fibrosis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1171wmis]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

What's new?

Diabetes is the commonest cause of CKD and ESKD globally and these people have a very high risk of CVD and death.
Trial data confirm that the rate of progression to ESKD, CVD and mortality in people with with CKD due to type‐2 diabetes can be can be effectively mitigated by established and newer interventions.
Recent studies demonstrate stark inadequacies and inequities in the management of diabetic CKD in the UK and elsewhere.
The updated ABCD‐UKKA Guidlines incorporate all recent trial evidences and propose a tiered approach to implementation of the recommendations, to promote a holistic, individualised mutiple‐risk factor intervention.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the 2020 KDIGO clinical practice guideline [^1166hHGL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed a clinical practice guideline in 2020 for the management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

The KDIGO Work Group (WG) was tasked with developing the guideline for diabetes management in CKD. It defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined systematic review topics, and graded evidence that had been summarized by an evidence review team. The English-language literature searches, which were initially done through October 2018, were updated in February 2020. The WG used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of the recommendations. Expert judgment was used to develop consensus practice points supplementary to the evidence-based graded recommendations. The guideline document underwent open public review. Comments from various stakeholders, subject matter experts, and industry and national organizations were considered before the document was finalized.

Recommendations

The guideline includes 12 recommendations and 48 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and CKD. This synopsis focuses on the key recommendations pertinent to the following issues: comprehensive care needs, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and educational and integrated care approaches.

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

It is now over 12 years since the launch of the KDIGO 2012 CKD Guideline and so the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is a very welcome authoritative update. However, despite the timescale involved it is regrettable that awareness, diagnosis and coding of CKD remains very poor across European countries and globally. Reasons for this lack of awareness of the need for CKD diagnosis and monitoring, despite estimation of GFR and uACR being enshrined not only in all CKD guidelines but also in multiple other guidelines including those for diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease for many years, are not really understood. However, it is likely that multiple barriers in combination conspire to maintain the current situation. We live in an era where we now have multiple treatments that can reduce the progression of CKD and modify the risk of the most important associated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The importance of early and accurate identification of individuals with CKD is now more important than ever.

This apparent lack of awareness within healthcare systems of the importance of CKD needs to be tackled as an urgent health priority across Europe. At the same time as addressing the lack of awareness of CKD amongst healthcare practitioners in general, it would seem sensible that people with concerns about their kidneys for whatever reason, and especially those considered at risk of CKD, should be empowered to seek clinical advice and be tested for kidney health. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline helpfully provides specific guidance on this (Table 3). Overall, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline should be seen as much more than just another document. It should be seen as a call to action across Europe to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of CKD. The guidelines are much more than just words.

Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has adverse liver, kidney, and cardiovascular consequences in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis therapy or with a kidney transplant. Since the publication of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) HCV Guideline in 2018, advances in HCV management, particularly in the field of antiviral therapy and treatment of HCV-associated glomerular diseases, coupled with increased usage of HCV-positive kidney grafts, have prompted a reexamination of the 2018 guideline. As a result, the Work Group performed a comprehensive review and revised the 2018 guidance. This Executive Summary highlights key aspects of the updated guideline recommendations for 3 chapters: Chapter 2: Treatment of HCV infection in patients with CKD; Chapter 4: Management of HCV-infected patients before and after kidney transplantation; and Chapter 5: Diagnosis and management of kidney diseases associated with HCV infection.

### Sex and gender differences in the management of chronic kidney disease and hypertension [^1113LpUr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is both a precursor to and a sequela of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is increasingly prevalent as kidney function declines and occurs in between 60 and 90% of individuals with CKD. Optimisation of blood pressure control reduces cardiovascular risk in CKD and may slow kidney disease progression thus blood pressure control is a critical component of CKD management.

In contrast to decreasing trends observed over time for other sequelae of hypertension (such as stroke and ischaemic heart disease), CKD is a growing problem: age-standardised mortality rates in CKD remain stubbornly high; and by 2040, CKD is projected to be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Sex and gender have key impacts on many aspects of CKD - including prevalence and patterns of disease, treatment decisions and clinical outcomes (Fig. 1). Though often incorrectly used interchangeably, sex and gender must be understood as different concepts. Sex is a biologically-determined characteristic reflecting physical differences whilst gender is self-ascribed and reflects socio-cultural factors.

KRT Initiation = Kidney replacement therapy initiation: decision-making regarding modality or conservative care as well as timing of dialysis initiation with respect to kidney function.

The pathophysiology of CKD appears to differ by sex. Accepting limitations relating to sampling bias and the markers used to estimate kidney function, CKD is reported to be more common in women, yet is thought to progress more slowly compared with men. Perhaps as a consequence, both kidney replacement therapy and age-standardised CKD-related mortality are markedly higher in men: the Global Burden of Disease Study (spanning over 20 years) quantified this increased CKD mortality risk at around 30%. Sex differences were broadly consistent across 50 countries, which may suggest biological sex is a greater contributor to CKD-related mortality than socio-cultural gender-related factors.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a selective update of the prior CKD-MBD guideline published in 2009. The guideline update and the original publication are intended to assist practitioners caring for adults with CKD and those receiving long-term dialysis.

Methods

Development of the guideline update followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. The approach adopted by the Work Group and the evidence review team was based on systematic reviews of relevant trials, appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and rating of the strength of recommendations according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through September 2015 and were supplemented with targeted searches through February 2017. Final modification of the guidelines was informed by a public review process involving numerous stakeholders, including patients, subject matter experts, and industry and national organizations.

Recommendations

The update process resulted in the revision of 15 recommendations. This synopsis focuses primarily on recommendations for diagnosis of and testing for CKD-MBD and treatment of CKD-MBD that emphasizes decreasing phosphate levels, maintaining calcium levels, and addressing elevated parathyroid hormone levels in adults with CKD stage G3a to G5 and those receiving dialysis. Key elements include basing treatment on trends in laboratory values rather than a single abnormal result and being cautious to avoid hypercalcemia when treating secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care: core components of integrated care for people with kidney failure [^113kUJBa]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Integrated kidney care requires synergistic linkage between preventative care for people at risk for chronic kidney disease and health services providing care for people with kidney disease, ensuring holistic and coordinated care as people transition between acute and chronic kidney disease and the 3 modalities of kidney failure management: conservative kidney management, transplantation, and dialysis. People with kidney failure have many supportive care needs throughout their illness, regardless of treatment modality. Kidney supportive care is therefore a vital part of this integrated framework, but is nonexistent, poorly developed, and/or poorly integrated with kidney care in many settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To address this, the International Society of Nephrology has (i) coordinated the development of consensus definitions of conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care to promote international understanding and awareness of these active treatments; and (ii) identified key considerations for the development and expansion of conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care programs, especially in low resource settings, where access to kidney replacement therapy is restricted or not available. This article presents the definitions for conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care; describes their core components with some illustrative examples to highlight key points; and describes some of the additional considerations for delivering conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care in low resource settings.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON ADVANCED AGE AND REPRODUCTIVE EXPECTATIONS

In a separate section, in contrast to the 2012 guidelines, the 2024 CKD Guideline discusses several special populations which must be considered, especially those at advanced age. This reflects the important challenges in managing advanced CKD in this demographic (Fig. 1). The evaluation of eGFR may be misleading as creatinine-based equations may be inaccurate due to sarcopenia and quality of life may be prioritized over survival advantage, therefore appropriate diagnosis and shared decision-making are key.

Figure 1:
The special populations in terms of kidney health with important clinical considerations.

The deleterious effects of CKD on reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes are well-established, with a clear need for discussion with individuals considering pregnancy. Although the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline has taken a step forward to identify multiple special populations potentially differing in terms of CKD management, it is important to emphasize that the current knowledge of optimal approaches to care in these specific patient groups is limited and evidence-based recommendations are weak, highlighting the definitive need for future studies.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^113Qvizh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) convened a work group to review the 2024 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The KDOQI Work Group reviewed the KDIGO guideline statements and practice points and provided perspective for implementation within the context of clinical practice in the United States. In general, the KDOQI Work Group concurs with several recommendations and practice points proposed by the KDIGO guidelines regarding CKD evaluation, risk assessment, and management options (both lifestyle and medications) for slowing CKD progression, addressing CKD-related complications, and improving cardiovascular outcomes. The KDOQI Work Group acknowledges the growing evidence base to support the use of several novel agents such as sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for several CKD etiologies, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for type 2 CKD in setting of diabetes. Further, KDIGO guidelines emphasize the importance of team-based care which was also recognized by the work group as a key factor to address the growing CKD burden. In this commentary, the Work Group has also assessed and discussed various barriers and potential opportunities for implementing the recommendations put forth in the 2024 KDIGO guidelines while the scientific community continues to focus on enhancing early identification of CKD and discovering newer therapies for managing kidney disease.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease-part 2: management and its complications [^114kP1bb]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Conceptual model of CKD: applications and implications [^111JNNmB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The conceptual model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was developed by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and subsequently revised and adopted by an international consensus under the auspices of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in 2005. This model includes concepts of definition, staging, outcomes, and treatment, as well as risk factors for the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Treatments are available for patients with risk factors and for each stage of CKD; these include slowing the progression of kidney disease, preventing and treating the complications of decreased glomerular filtration rate, and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors and treating cardiovascular disease. In principle, measures to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment could reduce adverse outcomes, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of individuals with CKD. The conceptual model for CKD is now being applied to a public health approach for the prevention of the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Primary prevention is defined as prevention of CKD; secondary and tertiary prevention are defined as improving outcomes of patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 and kidney failure (CKD stage 5), respectively. The conceptual model has also fostered debate about important questions: Is CKD a disease or a cardiovascular disease risk-factor condition? Do all patients with CKD need to be referred to a nephrologist? What does CKD care include? Should the classification be modified to include cause of disease and prognosis? Can CKD evolve from acute kidney disease, and is CKD reversible? Is albuminuria a manifestation of a kidney disease or systemic endothelial dysfunction? Is the age-related decrease in glomerular filtration rate normal or abnormal, and should we change the definition of CKD in the elderly? A combination of immediate action, data gathering, and research to establish the efficacy, effectiveness, and costs related to CKD are needed to respond to CKD as a public health problem.

### Diabetes and chronic kidney disease: an increasingly common multi-morbid disease in need of a paradigm shift in care [^111nvTp3]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes is considered the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease. The increasing incidence of obesity and an ageing population, together, will lead to a greater number of people with diabetes associated with chronic kidney disease that could either be secondary to diabetic nephropathy or of different aetiology. Ageing and obesity influence approaches to the management of diabetes and accurate assessment of kidney disease. People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease consume a disproportionate component of expenditure on medical care. Guidelines on managing diabetes and kidney disease do not recognize the complex multi-morbid nature of the process. In addition to managing glycaemia and monitoring renal function, the assessment and management of cardiovascular disease risk factors and cardiovascular disease itself need to be factored into care. People with diabetes and diabetic nephropathy are more vulnerable to retinopathy and foot complications requiring coordinated care. People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease are more prone to anaemia and metabolic bone disease than those without diabetes at similar stages of chronic kidney disease, further increasing their vulnerability to acute complications from cardiovascular disease, foot emergencies and fractures. People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease are also more prone to hospitalization with infections and acute kidney injury. Given the 30–40% prevalence of kidney disease amongst people with diabetes, potentially > 2% of the adult population would fit into this category, making it vital that new surveillance models of supported care are provided for those living with diabetes and kidney disease and for primary care teams who manage the vast majority of such people.

Implications of all the available evidence

The results presented here can help stakeholders form a comprehensive action plan to prevent and treat kidney disease. These actions should include increasing the awareness of CKD among the general public and health-care authorities as well as educational programmes for health-care personnel, appropriate treatment of risk factors, management of earlier stages of CKD, and development of facilities for treating patients with end-stage kidney disease. This work could be especially relevant for countries in low and middle SDI quintiles, where there is a large gap between CKD burden and provision of adequate health care.

CKD has also been recognised as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease independent of other conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.CKD is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality and is a risk multiplier in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Importantly, early detection and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and CKD is possible using readily available, often inexpensive, treatments. These interventions can improve renal and cardiovascular outcomes and slow or prevent progression to ESKD. Despite the availability of such interventions, the burden of CKD and its related risk factors remains understudied in many areas of the world. Even in countries with available data, disease awareness is low among both the general public and health-care authorities. As a result, many countries have underdeveloped nephrology workforces or mainly focus on the provision of treatment for ESKD but not for early stages of CKD.

'Due to complexity of the behavioral self-management regimen for diabetes and CKD and high frequency of nonadherence, alternative approaches to traditional education should be considered. (Moderate/Weak)'. The guideline notes that 'Education alone is not sufficient to promote and sustain healthy behavior change, particularly with such a complex regimen', and that 'To our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined adherence of people with diabetes and CKD to self-management regimens'. Evidence summarized indicates 'patients with diabetes had among the lowest rates of adherence across a range of 17 disease states, second only to those with sleep disorders', and that 'A survey of 2,056 adults with diabetes from across the United States found the most frequently reported adherence problem was diet, followed by exercise and blood glucose monitoring'.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease from 2020 comes at an opportune time when progress in diabetes technology and therapeutics offers new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. Management of haemoglobin A1c is important in diabetes, but an enlarging base of evidence from large clinical trials has demonstrated important new treatments offering organ protection and not just glucose management, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. It is the ambition that the guideline can help to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies based on high-quality evidence. Here, the focus has been on comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycaemic monitoring and targets, antihyperglycaemic therapies in patients with diabetes and CKD, and new developments since the guideline was published offering new opportunities and a wider target population for the new interventions.

ABSTRACT

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Guideline for Identification and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a welcome development, coming 12 years after the paradigm-changing 2012 guidelines. We are living in an unprecedented era in nephrology with novel therapies, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, now being proven in multiple randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce both the progression of CKD and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline is aimed at a broad audience looking after children and adults with CKD and provide practical and actionable steps to improve care. This commentary reviews the guideline sections pertaining to the evaluation and risk assessment of individuals with CKD from a European perspective. We feel that despite the last guideline being published 12 years ago, and the fact that the assessment of CKD has been emphasized by many other national/international nephrology, cardiology and diabetology guidelines and societies, the diagnosis and treatment of CKD remains poor across Europe. As such, the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline should be seen as an urgent call to action to improve diagnosis and care of children and adults with CKD across Europe. We know what we need to do. We now need to get on and do it.

Comprehensive diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) management — KDIGO introduces the concept of comprehensive care for CKD in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with emphasis on multidisciplinary risk reduction for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, and the KDOQI work group agrees with the need for multidisciplinary care involving primary care, related subspecialties, and other team members, supporting lifestyle changes as the foundation across all severities of CKD and those receiving kidney replacement therapy, including dialysis and kidney transplantation. The KDOQI commentary notes KDIGO's format change from varied-strength "statements" to graded "recommendations" and "practice points", and supports adopting this approach as a 20-year trend. The commentary also points out topics not addressed by KDIGO, such as care for adolescents and young adults, and highlights the importance of antiplatelet therapy, treatment of dyslipidemia, and smoking as key components addressed in the guideline.

### Prediction, progression, and outcomes of chronic kidney disease in older adults [^113DiUtZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a large and growing problem among aging populations. Although progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a costly and important clinical event with substantial morbidity, it appears less frequently in aging people compared with cardiovascular mortality. The measurement of kidney function and management of kidney disease in older individuals remain challenging, partly because the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying age-related decline in kidney function, the interactions between age and other risk factors in renal progression, and the associations of chronic kidney disease with other comorbidities in older people are understudied and poorly understood. The Association of Specialty Professors, the American Society of Nephrology, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases held a workshop, summarized in this article, to review what is known about chronic kidney disease, identify research gaps and resources available to address them, and identify priority areas for future research. Answers to emerging research questions will support the integration of geriatrics and nephrology and thus improve care for older patients at risk for chronic kidney disease.

### Optimizing renal anaemia management – benefits of early referral and treatment [^116UFECY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease and a growing literature concerning the treatment of renal anaemia in diverse patient groups, there remain uncertainties over definitions and descriptions for optimal management of renal anaemia. The patients most likely to derive the greatest long-term benefit from correction of anaemia are those with chronic kidney disease who are pre-dialysis. Early intervention to correct anaemia has the potential to impact on the progression of chronic kidney disease and affect patient morbidity, hospitalization rates, quality of life and mortality. This review considers current guidance on anaemia management, the evidence behind the guidance and the data shortfalls in an attempt to provide a topical overview of current understanding and future directions for optimal management of renal anaemia, particularly in high-risk groups.

### Applying multiple interventions in chronic kidney disease [^1147hcZ1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

The medical, social, and financial burdens posed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are many and growing rapidly. People generally reach ESRD as a result of chronic progressive kidney disease. Advancing kidney disease is associated with several treatable complications, which if poorly managed reduce the length and quality of life. In addition, there are strong links between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many people with less advanced CKD will die or suffer complications of CVD before reaching ESRD. Efficacious interventions, such as lowering blood pressure and treating dyslipidemia, can substantially reduce the progression of both kidney and cardiovascular disease. Careful management of these complex and interrelated diseases and risk factors requires detailed longitudinal and focused care which does not seem to be optimally delivered by health service practitioners organized in traditional ways. A disease management approach offers promise in this setting, but requires further study of clinical and economic impact.

Discussion

This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of self-management interventions for haemodialysis patients, highlighting their broad thematic scope, common intervention outcomes, and key self-management components. By synthesizing findings from fourteen studies across eight countries, we identified frequently measured outcomes such as quality of life, self-management, and self-efficacy, along with the most commonly used instruments. The majority of studies originated from Asia, which can be explained by several factors. Asian countries are known for their healthcare systems offering extensive coverage for dialysis treatments. Furthermore, these nations often prioritize preventive care, which promotes a focus on self-management strategies. Additionally, many Asian governments invest in research on chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment, due to the substantial financial burden these conditions impose on the healthcare system.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114MUoHU]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116pqhvF]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline structure

This manuscript provides an overview of the Recommendations made within the guideline with associated rationale. More information can be found in the full guideline document which is provided as a Supplementary appendix. The guideline Working Group provided recommendations on the use of therapies to manage anaemia of chronic kidney disease, how they can be used, research recommendations (what areas of ongoing clinical uncertainty exist) and audit recommendations (how effective implementation can be demonstrated). The group have reviewed the additional evidence from July 2016 using systematic literature searches to identify all published clinical evidence relevant to the review questions, via database (MEDLINE, PUBMED, Embase, and The Cochrane Library) searches using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms and study-type filters where appropriate.

This guideline update from the previous published 2017 guidance covers the management of anaemia in adults, children and young people with anaemia associated with CKD.

The evidence for these recommendations has been assessed using the modified GRADE system. The modified GRADE system defines both the strength of the recommendations of the guideline authors and the level of evidence upon which each of the recommendations is based (Table 1). This grading system classifies expert recommendations as "strong" (Grade 1) or "weak" (Grade 2) based upon the balance between the benefits and risks, burden and cost. The quality or level of evidence is designated as high (Grade A), moderate (Grade B), low (Grade C) or very low (D) depending on factors such as study design, directness of evidence and consistency of results. Grades of recommendation and quality of evidence may range from 1 A to 2D.

A summary of all the clinical practice guidelines on anaemia of chronic kidney disease is in Table 2.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113FAqMC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive multifactorial care components in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD): As key components of multifaceted intervention, clinicians should encourage people with diabetes and CKD to adopt healthy lifestyles that include improved nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation, and interventions should focus on aggressive treatment of CKD stage 1–5; although glycemic control has not been proven beneficial for kidney outcomes, it reduces risks for retinopathy and neuropathy, and treatment of elevated LDL-C improves cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes (except for those with LDL-C concentrations between 120 and 190 mg/dL who initiate statin therapy while on hemodialysis therapy); comprehensive care includes management of diabetes according to current standards, achieving glycemic targets with a combination of lifestyle approaches, behavioral self-management, and medicines, attention to screening for common comorbidities and referral to specialists such as those for eye and foot care, and, given the greatly increased CVD risk, managing risk factors with a goal of minimizing CVD.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: an update based on rapidly emerging new evidence [^114zUo4G]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

### Progression of chronic kidney disease: can it be prevented or arrested? [^116BJv2y]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease constitutes a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Left untreated, it progresses inexorably to greater levels of severity at variable rates. The morbid impact of chronic kidney disease is heightened by its role as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the past two decades, considerable gains have been realized in retarding progression of chronic kidney disease by emphasizing blood pressure control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Notwithstanding, the therapeutic goal of preventing or arresting chronic kidney disease progression remains unfulfilled. Currently attainable rates of decrease in glomerular filtration rate remain at 2 to 8 mL/min/y depending on the underlying disease. It is now believed that to achieve optimal therapeutic targets (proteinuria of < 500 mg/day and decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 1 mL/min/y, the average age-related decline) we must introduce novel strategies and a multifaceted approach to treatment that interrupts multiple mechanisms of progression. To this end, and wherever relevant, new approaches to cause-specific treatment must be applied, such as targeted immunosuppression, intensive glycemic control, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, in all chronic kidney disease, we must interfere more effectively with the multitude of common mechanisms of progression. Established or putative, such approaches include aggressive blood pressure control; advanced renin-angiotensin system blockade; cytokine modulation and antifibrotic therapy; aldosterone blockade; endothelin blockade, nitric oxide modulation and vasopeptidase inhibition; antioxidant therapy; statin therapy; glycosaminoglycan therapy; anemia therapy; dietary restrictions; lifestyle changes; and pharmacogenomic profiling. Such a concerted, multifaceted approach to management might indeed prevent or arrest progression of chronic kidney disease, or even achieve regression of chronic kidney disease.

### Kidney disease: improving global outcomes [^111t41w7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) is an independent organization with the mission to improve care and outcomes of patients with kidney disease worldwide through the development and coordination of clinical practice guidelines. KDIGO has established firm links with other organizations that have previously produced clinical practice guidelines in the field of kidney disease. The first three KDIGO guidelines — treatment of hepatitis C, management of bone and mineral disease, and care of kidney transplant recipients — have been finalized and the next three — acute kidney injury, management of glomerulonephritis, and management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — are under development. The ultimate goal is to cover most major aspects of care for patients with kidney disease. Corner stones of KDIGO's guideline development process are independent, multidisciplinary, international work groups, close collaboration with professional methodology experts who perform systematic evidence reviews, and open public review of each guideline. Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is applied for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. International conferences organized by KDIGO support the coordination of guideline development, assess the suitability of guideline topics and help to establish global consensus on definitions and policies.

### Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2024 clinical practice guideline [^115dGtHR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization updated its existing clinical practice guideline in 2024 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving kidney replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD.

### Global kidney health 2017 and beyond: a roadmap for closing gaps in care, research, and policy [^112xUpnG]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The global nephrology community recognises the need for a cohesive plan to address the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In July, 2016, the International Society of Nephrology hosted a CKD summit of more than 85 people with diverse expertise and professional backgrounds from around the globe. The purpose was to identify and prioritise key activities for the next 5–10 years in the domains of clinical care, research, and advocacy and to create an action plan and performance framework based on ten themes: strengthen CKD surveillance; tackle major risk factors for CKD; reduce acute kidney injury-a special risk factor for CKD; enhance understanding of the genetic causes of CKD; establish better diagnostic methods in CKD; improve understanding of the natural course of CKD; assess and implement established treatment options in patients with CKD; improve management of symptoms and complications of CKD; develop novel therapeutic interventions to slow CKD progression and reduce CKD complications; and increase the quantity and quality of clinical trials in CKD. Each group produced a prioritised list of goals, activities, and a set of key deliverable objectives for each of the themes. The intended users of this action plan are clinicians, patients, scientists, industry partners, governments, and advocacy organisations. Implementation of this integrated comprehensive plan will benefit people who are at risk for or affected by CKD worldwide.

### Nutrition education in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [^114NP29A]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Diet counseling and nutrition education are recommended in the prevention and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The importance of effectively addressing nutrition with patients has grown given the increasing prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; conditions which influence CKD/ESRD. Dietary advice for individuals with CKD/ESRD can be seen as complex; and successful dietary management requires careful planning, periodic assessment of nutritional status, as well as monitoring of dietary compliance. In spite of recommendations and pressing need, formal training in nutrition and adequate preparation for providers is limited; and for physicians the lack of nutrition education has been acknowledged, repeatedly, as an area for improvement in medical training curricula. It has also been suggested that dietitians have an essential role in management of CKD in the primary care setting; however, dietitians who do not practice renal education daily may need training on the specific challenges in CKD/ESRD. The objectives of this chapter were to: characterize select nutrition education resources for providers who care for patients with CKD/ESRD; summarize key dietary components emphasized in the care of patients with CKD/ESRD; and address practical considerations in educational efforts focused on nutrition and CKD/ESRD.

### Self-management interventions for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rMqTN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD: maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 440,000 patients begin dialysis each year worldwide, and annual costs of dialysis and kidney transplants range between US $35,000 and 100,000. This can strain healthcare budgets. Clinical decision making for CKD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases, variability in rates of disease progression, and the competing risk of cardiovascular mortality, the most common cause of death worldwide. Furthermore, CKD is not included in the list of priorities for most non-communicable diseases (NCD), and few countries have clear policies or public programs to prevent and control CKD.

CKD management includes slowing the progression to ESRD and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular complications through management of kidney function and CKD progression risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition to medication, managing risk factors is important clinically because it can prevent, or at least minimize, the likelihood of further renal injury. Long-term CKD management requires a high level of patient involvement, both in decision-making and in the implementation of care. There is growing recognition that patients want to be involved as equal partners in their care. The goal of self-management is to identify strategies that can be used to help patients manage their condition(s) while leading active and productive lives. This includes goal setting, problem solving, symptom management, and shared decision-making, and these strategies are applicable for a diverse population. For patients with CKD, this encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations (self-management maintenance) to recognition of early warning signs, and self-adjustment of home-care regimens.

Despite an established tradition of patient self-management of ESRD, and self-management being a well-established treatment strategy for other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, evidence to support its use for CKD non-dialysis is limited. To lighten the economic burden of ESRD, strategies must be implemented to prevent the progression from early-stage CKD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized results from RCTs to evaluate the effects of self-management intervention on major renal outcomes and mortality in non-dialysis adults with CKD. We also assessed effect modification by proteinuria and blood pressure.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### A synopsis of the evidence for the science and clinical management of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111mx33o]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

A growing appreciation of the pathophysiological interrelatedness of metabolic risk factors such as obesity and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease has led to the conceptualization of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. The confluence of metabolic risk factors and chronic kidney disease within cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome is strongly linked to risk for adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. In addition, there are unique management considerations for individuals with established cardiovascular disease and coexisting metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, or both. An extensive body of literature supports our scientific understanding of, and approach to, prevention and management for individuals with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. However, there are critical gaps in knowledge related to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome in terms of mechanisms of disease development, heterogeneity within clinical phenotypes, interplay between social determinants of health and biological risk factors, and accurate assessments of disease incidence in the context of competing risks. There are also key limitations in the data supporting the clinical care for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, particularly in terms of early-life prevention, screening for risk factors, interdisciplinary care models, optimal strategies for supporting lifestyle modification and weight loss, targeting of emerging cardioprotective and kidney-protective therapies, management of patients with both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and the impact of systematically assessing and addressing social determinants of health. This scientific statement uses a crosswalk of major guidelines, in addition to a review of the scientific literature, to summarize the evidence and fundamental gaps related to the science, screening, prevention, and management of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.

Outcomes — For the first key question, the critical outcome is point prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by risk factor and patient demographics/characteristics, and important outcomes include probability of decline in eGFR, incident/worsening of albuminuria, or kidney failure; incidence rates of CKD diagnosis; CKD stage at diagnosis; kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant); and CKD diagnosis rate at different predefined timepoints. For the second key question, critical outcomes are risk of CKD progression to ESKD and validated surrogate markers/predictors of CKD progression, and important outcomes are mortality and cardiovascular composite outcome (e.g. MACE).

### Role and prognostic value of individual ambulatory blood pressure components in chronic kidney disease [^1166fADj]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a key risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but can also be a detrimental consequence of established CKD. Unsurprisingly, the majority of subjects with abnormal creatinine in the general population are also hypertensive, with a huge toll on national health care systems worldwide due to a staggering increase in the risk of cardiovascular complications and end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy. In this setting, a comprehensive and careful assessment of the whole 24-h blood pressure (BP) profile could be of paramount importance in ensuring a timely diagnosis of hypertension and an optimal therapeutic control. Hence, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has the potential to become the preferred method for optimal clinical management of CKD patients. ABPM might better define the relationship between BP, target organ damage (TOD), and clinical outcomes. Current evidence suggests that specific day-night BP components, along with average BP values, may have clinical relevance in such patients, despite the suboptimal statistical power of available studies and inconsistencies on the prognostic value of individual BP components. The main aim of our review is to scrutinize the evidence for the usage of ABPM in CKD patients, including the relationship between ambulatory BP recordings and cardiovascular events, and the distinctive features of ABPM in these subjects.

This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2018 clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an extensive update of KDIGO's 2008 guideline on HCV infection in CKD. This update reflects the major advances since the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in the management of HCV infection in the CKD population.

Methods

The KDIGO work group tasked with developing the HCV and CKD guideline defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined topics for systematic review, and graded the quality of evidence previously summarized by the evidence review team. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to appraise the quality of evidence and rate the strength of the recommendations. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through May 2017 and were supplemented with targeted searches for studies of DAA treatment and with abstracts from nephrology, hepatology, and transplantation conferences. A review process involving many stakeholders, subject matter experts, and industry and national organizations informed the guideline's final modification.

Recommendation

The updated guideline comprises 66 recommendations. This synopsis focuses on 32 key recommendations pertinent to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of HCV infection in adult CKD populations.

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116xKfSw]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials that warrant a re-examination of previous recommendations. Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO decided to convene 2 Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the current KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused mainly on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

Description

The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease is an update of the 2020 guideline from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

Methods

The KDIGO Work Group updated the guideline, which included reviewing and grading new evidence that was identified and summarized. As in the previous guideline, the Work Group used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of recommendations and expert judgment to develop consensus practice points. New evidence led to updating of recommendations in the chapters Comprehensive Care in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 1) and Glucose-Lowering Therapies in Patients With T2D and CKD (Chapter 4). New evidence did not change recommendations in the chapters Glycemic Monitoring and Targets in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle Interventions in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to Management of Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5).

Recommendations

The updated guideline includes 13 recommendations and 52 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A focus on preserving kidney function and maintaining well-being is recommended using a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventions, self-management, and first-line pharmacotherapy (such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. To this are added additional drugs with heart and kidney protection, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and interventions to control risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, such as blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids.

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111proz3]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

### Conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care: core components of integrated care for people with kidney failure [^11479UQL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

As part of its focus on integrated care of people with kidney failure, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) brought together patients with kidney failure, health care professionals, researchers, academic and health care institutions, and policy makers to formulate a 5- to 10-year strategy to improve global access to safe, sustainable, and equitable integrated care for people with kidney failure. "Integrated kidney care" requires synergistic linkage between preventative care for people at risk for chronic kidney disease and health services providing care for people with kidney disease, ensuring holistic and coordinated care as people transition between acute and chronic kidney disease and the 3 modalities of kidney failure management: conservative kidney management (CKM), transplantation, and dialysis. People with kidney failure have many supportive care needs throughout their illness; kidney supportive care (KSC) is therefore a vital part of this integrated framework to address these needs regardless of treatment modality. Action plans were categorized into 5 themes and workgroups: monitor, dialysis, resources, transplantation, and conservative kidney management and kidney supportive care. The aim of the CKM/KSC Workgroup is to define key considerations for the development and expansion of CKM and KSC as core components of integrated kidney care. This will involve identification of countries with no or limited services and training programs and development of materials and pathways for implementation of sustainable CKM and KSC programs. Through a series of consensus meetings, the workgroup will perform its activities within 4 projects that have been revised since the initial publication of the strategic plan, outlined in Box 1. Progress with these initial projects will define the direction of future activities.
