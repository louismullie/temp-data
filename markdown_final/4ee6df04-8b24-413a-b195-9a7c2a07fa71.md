## Question

How does the sensitivity for detecting kidney stones compare between ultrasound and non-contrast CT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the sensitivity for detecting kidney stones compares between ultrasound and non-contrast CT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic reference standard to anchor the comparison. Then, I should quantify CT sensitivity from high-quality data. Next, I will quantify ultrasound sensitivity across populations and study designs. After that, I need to examine modifiers such as stone size, location, and operator dependence. Then, I will synthesize the comparative performance and the magnitude of the sensitivity gap. Finally, I should align the evidence with guideline recommendations and translate this into practical clinical implications for different scenarios like pregnancy and pediatrics [^117GnFPB] [^111kMaDx].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic reference standard. Non-contrast CT is consistently treated as the gold standard for urolithiasis due to its superior diagnostic accuracy and ability to detect small stones and alternative diagnoses; both major reviews and contemporary guidelines endorse this, positioning non-contrast CT as the benchmark against which ultrasound performance should be measured [^117GnFPB] [^111kMaDx] [^116P58kz].

> Now, I should quantify CT sensitivity. True non-contrast CT (tNCT) demonstrates approximately 95–100% sensitivity for urinary calculi in contemporary series, which aligns with earlier emergency department data showing 97% sensitivity and 98% negative predictive value for helical CT in acute flank pain; thin-slice reconstructions further improve detection of very small stones, reaching 92.1% sensitivity with 1.25 mm slices for 2–4 mm calculi [^117BXjP7] [^1112eiYs] [^114ZTdTv]. Wait, let me verify a common pitfall here: I must not conflate virtual non-contrast (vNCT) derived from dual-energy CT with true non-contrast CT; vNCT can have lower and more heterogeneous sensitivity, so for head-to-head comparisons against ultrasound, tNCT remains the appropriate reference and should not be substituted by vNCT estimates [^116Ppz5W] [^114B88UM]. I should also note one nuance: CT underreports the exact number of minute papillary stones compared with endoscopy but still tracks overall stone burden accurately, which is what typically guides management decisions [^116KU2Qo].

> Next, I will examine ultrasound sensitivity. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ultrasound performance varies widely by methodology and patient factors. Pooled data suggest roughly 45% sensitivity for ureteric and renal calculi overall, though some series report about 70% sensitivity per stone and near 79–89% sensitivity for detecting at least one stone per kidney, often with a trade-off of lower specificity in those higher sensitivity estimates; importantly, in a direct head-to-head cohort, 37.4% of stones seen on CT were entirely missed by ultrasound with a mean missed size of 4.5 mm, which is clinically consequential [^1127gxL4] [^111qJB1i] [^113wAGrU] [^112wPrU3]. In children, per-kidney sensitivity sits near two-thirds, reinforcing that ultrasound is imperfect even in pediatric cohorts where it is often preferred to avoid radiation [^113GURr7].

> I need to check the critical factors that degrade ultrasound sensitivity. Stone size is the dominant determinant; stones ≤ 5 mm are frequently missed and, when seen, tend to be overmeasured by about 1.9–2.2 mm versus CT, with discordance rising as stones get smaller and as depth or gain increases; these effects reflect operator settings and acoustic limitations rather than random error, and they complicate decisions near thresholds for observation versus intervention [^1127gxL4] [^112wPrU3] [^116L7TFQ]. Let me consider location and artifacts too: ureteral stones, especially mid to distal, are more challenging than renal calculi to visualize, and although the twinkle artifact can be sensitive, it carries a false-positive risk in the absence of confirmatory shadowing; acoustic shadow width techniques may improve sizing, but that is not yet universally implemented in clinical workflows [^111qJB1i] [^113r5Fsh] [^113TxNuh].

> I will now synthesize comparative performance. CT reliably detects stones down to about 2–3 mm with high sensitivity and near-perfect negative predictive value in acute settings, and it objectively characterizes size and burden with minimal operator dependence; ultrasound offers radiation-free, lower-cost, real-time imaging but misses a substantial fraction of stones, particularly ≤ 5 mm and ureteral stones, and tends to overestimate size by roughly 1–2 mm, which can misclassify management thresholds; considering CT sensitivities around 95–100% versus ultrasound ranges around 45–88% depending on the denominator and study design, the sensitivity gap typically spans about 15–55 percentage points and widens as stones get smaller, while CT also provides alternative diagnoses in a meaningful minority of patients with flank pain [^117BXjP7] [^1112eiYs] [^1127gxL4] [^111qJB1i] [^113wAGrU] [^112wPrU3]. Hmm, wait a minute — those ultrasound figures that approach 89% are "any stone per kidney" metrics with lower specificity; I should not overinterpret them as equivalent to per-stone sensitivity or as comparable to CT's accuracy, which remains markedly higher on a per-stone basis [^113wAGrU] [^1127gxL4].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned strategies that balance accuracy with safety. The EAU recommends ultrasound as the initial test in suspected stone disease but advises non-contrast CT to confirm the diagnosis, effectively acknowledging the sensitivity limitations of ultrasound; the ACR specifies ultrasound as the initial modality in pregnancy, with CT reserved when necessary, and both bodies emphasize dose-reduction strategies, including low- or ultra-low-dose CT or limited-field protocols to mitigate cumulative radiation in recurrent stone formers [^116P58kz] [^111kMaDx] [^112vwgDG] [^113PxCYL] [^116c9SoE] [^114B88UM]. Hold on, I should verify a potential confusion: while dual-energy techniques and virtual non-contrast reconstructions can reduce dose in multiphasic protocols, they are not yet a universal substitute for tNCT in stone detection workflows, especially for small calculi, so their role should be contextualized rather than assumed equivalent [^116Ppz5W] [^1139SbLV] [^114GBXc3].

> Finally, I will translate this into a clinical conclusion. For suspected urolithiasis, non-contrast CT provides about 95–100% sensitivity and an excellent negative predictive value, with accurate stone sizing and burden assessment; ultrasound generally achieves around 45–70% per-stone sensitivity in adults, may reach nearly 79–89% for "any stone per kidney" at the expense of specificity, and performs around two-thirds sensitivity in pediatrics, while tending to overestimate size and miss many ≤ 5 mm or ureteral stones; therefore, ultrasound is appropriate as a first-line screen or for radiation-sensitive populations, but non-contrast CT is indicated when ultrasound is negative and suspicion remains high, when precise sizing or location will alter management, or when alternative diagnoses are a concern [^117BXjP7] [^1112eiYs] [^1127gxL4] [^111qJB1i] [^113wAGrU] [^113GURr7] [^112wPrU3]. But wait, what if I overstate CT perfection? I should double-check that endoscopic validation shows CT can miss the smallest clusters and undercount the number of tiny papillary stones, yet it still captures clinically relevant stone burden on average, which is the key management driver in most cases [^116KU2Qo].

Non-contrast CT is the **gold standard** [^117GnFPB] for kidney stone detection, with **sensitivity 95–100%** and **specificity 94–100%** [^117BXjP7]. Ultrasound has lower sensitivity (45–70%) [^1127gxL4] but high specificity (88–94%) [^111qJB1i]; it is radiation-free and suitable for initial assessment [^116P58kz], pregnancy [^112vwgDG], and pediatrics [^113GURr7]. CT is superior for small (< 5 mm) [^114ZTdTv] and ureteral stones [^111kMaDx], whereas ultrasound is less accurate for these [^1127gxL4] and may overestimate size [^112wPrU3]. Use **ultrasound first** [^116P58kz] in low-risk or radiation-sensitive patients [^117GnFPB], and reserve CT for inconclusive cases [^111kMaDx] or when precise stone characterization is needed [^115PqGAK].

| **Attribute** | **Non-contrast CT** | **Ultrasound** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 95–100% | 45–70% |
| Specificity | 94–100% | 88–94% |
| Radiation exposure | Yes | No |
| Clinical use | - Gold standard <br/> - Detects small and ureteral stones <br/> - Precise sizing | - Initial assessment <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Pediatrics <br/> - May miss small/ureteral stones |

### Limitations to ultrasound in the detection and measurement of urinary tract calculi [^1127gxL4]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate differences in stone measurement using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US), axial unenhanced helical CT is the reference-standard imaging modality for the assessment of urinary tract calculi. However, US is also commonly used. Differences in stone measurement using these techniques are poorly described, and contributors to measurement error remain unknown.

All patients at our institution undergoing both abdominal CT and renal US less than 1 month apart since June 2004 were reviewed. Solitary renal calculi were identified on both CT and US in all cases.

We identified 71 calculi in 60 patients. Compared with CT, US overestimated stone size, an effect that was more pronounced with smaller calculi. The mean stone measurement on CT was 7.4 ± 4.4 mm, and on US, it was 9.2 ± 4.5 mm (P = 0.018). For stones ≤ 5 mm, US measurements were a mean of 1.9 ± 1.2 mm greater than CT (P < .001). US and CT measurements were discordant for 60% of stones ≤ 5 mm. Discordance was associated with US measurement of skin-to-stone distance (P = 0.018), but not body mass index (P = 0.189) or location within the urinary tract (P = 0.161). A review of the literature revealed that US has a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 45% and 94%, respectively, for the detection of ureteric calculi and 45% and 88%, respectively, for renal calculi.

US overestimates stone size in urolithiasis, a finding that may have implications for stone management. Discordance in stone measurement varies with size and is greatest in stones ≤ 5 mm.

### The efficacy of ultrasonography for the detection of renal stone [^111qJB1i]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of ultrasonography (US) for detecting renal stones using noncontrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) as a standard reference, a retrospective study was conducted. This study included 428 patients who underwent NCCT and US imaging on the same day from January 2009 to September 2011. The sensitivity of US to detect each individual stone and at least one stone per kidney was evaluated. Detection rates according to the location and stone size were also examined. Stone sizes were compared in the longest axis of NCCT and US, and group classification was performed based on size to examine whether stone sizes measured by NCCT and US were similar.

Of 856 kidneys, NCCT detected 474 stones in 361 kidneys, whereas US detected 332 out of 474 stones detected by NCCT, resulting in a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity of 94.4%. Similarly, US alone detected at least one stone in 285 kidneys, yielding a sensitivity of 78.9% and a specificity of 83.7%. Expectedly, the detection rate for the left upper calyx was lower than that for other sites (P = 0.002). The detection rate increased with stone size. Furthermore, stone sizes obtained by US were positively correlated with those obtained by CT, and stone size measurement by NCCT and US was concordant in 240 of 332 cases (72%). Importantly, stone size was the only factor that affected renal stone diagnosis using US.

In conclusion, US is an effective imaging modality for detecting renal stones.

### Ultrasonography significantly overestimates stone size when compared to low-dose, noncontrast computed tomography [^112wPrU3]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the differences between low-dose noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and renal ultrasound (US) in the identification and measurement of urinary calculi, a retrospective review was conducted at three institutions. This review included patients evaluated for flank pain with both renal US and NCCT within one day of one another from 2012 to 2015. Stone presence and size were compared between imaging modalities, with stone size determined by the largest measured diameter. Stones were grouped into size categories (≤ 5mm, 5.1–10mm, and > 10mm) based on NCCT and compared with US. Statistical analysis was performed using two-sided t-tests.

One hundred fifty-five patients received both a renal US and NCCT within one day. In 79 patients (51.0%), both US and NCCT identified a stone for size comparison. Fifty-eight patients (37.4%) had a stone visualized on NCCT but not on US, and 2 patients (1.3%) had a stone documented on US but not seen on NCCT. The average NCCT size of the stones missed on US was 4.5mm. When comparing the average largest stone diameter for US (9.1mm) versus NCCT (6.9mm), US overestimated stone size by 2.2mm (P < 0.001). Ultrasound significantly overestimated the stone size by at least 1mm in 93 of 155 patients (60.0%), and by over 2mm in 57 of 155 patients (36.8%). This finding was most prominent in stones greater than 10mm.

US significantly overestimated stone size and this was most pronounced for small (≤ 5mm) stones. The potential for systematic overestimation of stone size with standard US techniques should be taken into consideration when evaluating endourologic treatment options.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BXjP7]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Haematuria is a common finding in clinical practice and can be described as visible or microscopic. The prevalence of microscopic haematuria varies from 1% to 18%, depending on patient age, gender, and rate of testing. Clinical differentials for microscopic haematuria include urinary calculi, malignancy, and strictures. Urolithiasis is particularly common, affecting the Australian population with an incidence of 0.13% per year. The lifetime prevalence of urinary calculi is higher for males (15%) compared to females (8%).

Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard imaging test for microscopic haematuria as it can diagnose urinary calculi, renal masses, and urothelial tumours. CT urography has a reported low diagnostic yield of 22.1% for a clinically significant cause of haematuria. A contemporary multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) urogram protocol consists of a non-contrast scan and one or two subsequent acquisitions after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast. The true non-contrast CT scan (tNCT) is performed to identify urinary calculi. Bhojani et al. reported that tNCT alone has a sensitivity of 95–100% for the detection of urinary calculi. Either combined (dual phase) or separate nephrographic and late excretory phase acquisitions are then performed to identify renal masses and urothelial tumours.

A disadvantage of CT urography is the radiation dose, which can be up to three times that of a routine CT abdomen scan due to the multiple phases required. Advances in CT technology have given rise to the development of dual-energy (DE) and spectral imaging techniques, which are designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and potentially reduce radiation exposure.

### Acoustic shadowing in pediatric kidney stone ultrasound: A retrospective study with non-enhanced computed tomography as reference standard [^113r5Fsh]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The usefulness of acoustic shadowing as a feature of pediatric kidney stone ultrasound (US) may be underestimated. The hypothesis was that the majority of stones in children have acoustic shadowing and that its specificity is high (> 90%) in pediatric kidney stones.

- **Materials and methods**: Our retrospective observational study included children who had undergone abdominal non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for kidney stones in a pediatric renal stone referral center between 2015 and 2016. US examinations prior to CT were retrospectively assessed for US features such as acoustic shadowing, twinkle artifact, and stone size. These features were compared to CT as the reference standard.

- **Results**: Thirty-one patients (median age: 13 years, range: 1–17 years) with 77 suspected kidney stones were included. The median stone size was 5 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 5 mm). For acoustic shadowing, sensitivity was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 56–80%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 56–100%). All kidney stones with a diameter ≥ 9 mm demonstrated shadowing. Sensitivity for the twinkle artifact was 88% (95% CI 72–96%), but specificity for the twinkle artifact could not be calculated due to the lack of true negatives. All false-positive stones on US demonstrated twinkle artifact, but none showed shadowing.

- **Conclusion**: Acoustic shadowing was demonstrated in the majority of pediatric kidney stones. Specificity was high, but this was not significant. The twinkle artifact is a sensitive US tool for detecting pediatric kidney calculi but poses a risk of false-positive findings.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^114KVLtP]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

Of 5383 "flank pain protocol" CT scans (non-enhanced CT scans using a renal colic protocol) performed in the emergency departments on patients 18 years of age or older during the retrospective period, 1853 (34.4%) were randomly selected for a full record review. Of these, 1040 were complete records with no exclusion criteria. Approximately half (49.5%; 515 of 1040) of the patients had a ureteral stone causing symptoms on their computed tomogram, whereas 2.9% (30 of 1040) had acutely important alternative causes of symptoms. Inter-rater reliability for categorization of the CT result yielded a κ of 0.75–0.80, indicating excellent agreement.

- **Prevalence of ureteral stone by STONE score category**: Percentages at the top of bars indicate the prevalence of ureteral stone in the group. Values under bars indicate the number within derivation and validation sets that fell within risk stratums.

- **Derivation sample characteristics**: Table 1 lists the demographics of derivation and validation cohorts.

- **Significant predictors for ureteral stone**: Table 2 shows factors significant for the presence or absence of a ureteral stone on univariate analysis.

### Ultrasound use in urinary stones: Adapting old technology for a modern-day disease [^114S3Y4Y]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has become a mainstay tool in urologists' armamentarium for the diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis. From starting as a rudimentary form of imaging, it has come to play a more prominent role over time, paralleling evolution in ultrasound technology. Throughout the medical community, there is a growing emphasis on reducing the amount of ionizing radiation delivered to patients during routine imaging. As such, there has been a resurgence of interest in ultrasound given its lack of associated radiation exposure and proven effectiveness as a diagnostic and therapeutic imaging modality. Herein, we provide a review of the history of ultrasound, how the use of ultrasound is expanding in both the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease, and finally, how promising applications of ultrasound are shaping the future of kidney stone management.

### Single-energy CT predicts uric acid stones with accuracy comparable to dual-energy CT-prospective validation of a quantitative method [^113umL9C]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary stone disease continues to be an increasing reason for health care admissions worldwide, with an incidence of 7% among women and 11% among men in the United States in 2010. In Northern Europe, an increasing frequency of uric acid (UA) stones has been reported. Approximately 7–11% of all urinary stones are UA stones.

Distinguishing UA from non-UA stones is of particular interest for the urologist, as the former can be treated with alkalization of the urine, allowing for secondary prophylaxis after ex vivo composition analysis of a passed or surgically removed stone. Ideally, a UA stone is identified and dissolved in vivo to facilitate stone passage and obviate surgical removal. At present, in vivo stone composition analysis is mostly accomplished with dual-energy CT (DE-CT), which has shown high accuracy in several studies.

### Diagnosis and initial management of kidney stones [^112AesrX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and initial management of urolithiasis have undergone considerable evolution in recent years. The application of noncontrast helical computed tomography (CT) in patients with suspected renal colic is one major advance. The superior sensitivity and specificity of helical CT allow urolithiasis to be diagnosed or excluded definitively and expeditiously, without the potential harmful effects of contrast media.

Initial management is based on three key concepts:

- **Recognition of urgent and emergency requirements**: Urologic consultation is crucial.
- **Effective pain control**: Use a combination of narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in appropriate patients.
- **Understanding of the impact of stone location and size**: This influences the natural history and definitive urologic management.

These concepts are discussed with reference to contemporary literature, with the goal of providing tools that family physicians can use in the emergency department or clinic.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ppz5W]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, virtual non-contrast (vNCT) generated from dual-energy CT (DECT) demonstrated a moderate pooled sensitivity of 78.1%. High heterogeneity was observed between studies, partially due to variation in study methods. Methodological differences accounted for some of the heterogeneity between studies.

The subgroup of oral hydration and slice thickness or increment of less than 2 mm recorded the highest sensitivity of 92.2%. These findings suggest the potential of replacing the true non-contrast (tNCT) phase in CT urography split-bolus protocol with vNCT for detecting urinary calculi.

A vNCT DECT urography protocol resulted in increased efficiency with reduced time on the CT scanner, along with significant reductions in radiation dose (28% to 47%) for patients undergoing CT urography, which is the gold standard imaging method for hematuria screening.

The subgroup of studies using less than 2 mm slice thickness or increments had the highest and third-highest pooled sensitivity among the five subgroups. The study by Keteslegers et al. demonstrated that thinner slice thickness improved sensitivity for detecting urinary calculi by reducing partial volume effects on tNCT. Four out of six studies using slice thickness or increments of 2 mm or greater reported that the size of the undetected urinary calculi was significantly smaller than the calculi that were detected. vNCT may also be further affected by over- or under-subtraction of iodine contrast, which may mask calculi secondary to partial voluming.

### Validation of an automated CT image analysis in the prevention of urinary stones with hydration trial [^113FSj3W]. Journal of Endourology (2025). Low credibility.

Objective: Kidney stone growth and new stone formation are common clinical trial endpoints and are associated with future symptomatic events. At the time of writing, a manual review of CT scans has been required to assess stone growth and new stone formation, which is laborious. We validated the performance of a software algorithm that automatically identified, registered, and measured stones over longitudinal CT studies.

Methods: We validated the performance of a pretrained machine learning algorithm to classify stone outcomes on longitudinal CT scan images at baseline and at the end of the 2-year follow-up period for 62 participants aged over 18 years in the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) randomized controlled trial. Stones were defined as an area of voxels with a minimum linear dimension of 2 mm that was higher in density than the mean plus four standard deviations of all nonnegative HU values within the kidney.

- **Outcomes assessed**:
	1. Growth of at least one existing stone by ≥ 2 mm.
	2. Formation of at least one new ≥ 2 mm stone.
	3. No stone growth or new stone formation.
	4. Loss of at least one stone.

The accuracy of the algorithm was determined by comparing its outcomes to the gold standard of independent review of the CT images by at least two expert clinicians.

Results: The algorithm correctly classified outcomes for 61 paired scans (98.4%). One pair that the algorithm incorrectly classified as stone growth was a new renal artery calcification on end-of-study CT. An automated image analysis method validated for the prospective evaluation of kidney stones demonstrates significant potential in improving efficiency in clinical trials pertaining to urinary stone developments.

### Dual-energy CT kidney stone characterization-can diagnostic accuracy be achieved at low radiation dose [^115PqGAK]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Objectives**: To assess the accuracy of low-dose dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to differentiate uric acid from non-uric acid kidney stones in two generations of dual-source DECT with stone composition analysis as the reference standard.

- **Methods**: Patients who received a low-dose unenhanced DECT for the detection or follow-up of urolithiasis and stone extraction with stone composition analysis between January 2020 and January 2022 were retrospectively included. Collected stones were characterized using X-ray diffraction. Size, volume, CT attenuation, and stone characterization were assessed using DECT post-processing software. Characterization as uric acid or non-uric acid stones was compared to stone composition analysis as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of stone classification were computed. Dose length product (DLP) and effective dose served as radiation dose estimates.

- **Results**: A total of 227 stones in 203 patients were analyzed. Stone composition analysis identified 15 uric acid and 212 non-uric acid stones. Mean size and volume were 4.7 mm × 2.8 mm and 114 mm³, respectively. CT attenuation of uric acid stones was significantly lower compared to non-uric acid stones (p < 0.001). Two hundred twenty-five of 227 kidney stones were correctly classified by DECT. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 1.0 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), respectively. Eighty-two of 84 stones with a diameter of ≤ 3 mm were correctly classified. Mean DLP was 162 ± 57 mGy*cm and effective dose was accurately estimated.

### The utility of the kidneys-ureters-bladder radiograph as the sole imaging modality and its combination with ultrasonography for the detection of renal stones [^113wAGrU]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

To investigate the efficacy of plain radiography and ultrasonography as sole imaging tools, as well as their combined use for detecting renal stones, unenhanced computed tomography was used as a standard reference. Ultrasonography and plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are frequently employed for urinary tract stone detection; however, the effectiveness of each method when used alone or in combination remains controversial.

From January 2012 to September 2014, 822 patients underwent plain radiography, ultrasonography, and unenhanced computed tomography on the same day. The sensitivity and specificity of the two modalities for detecting stones were evaluated. We compared the sizes of stones on plain radiography and ultrasonography with their sizes on unenhanced computed tomography.

Of 1644 kidneys, unenhanced computed tomography detected at least one stone in 994 kidneys. Ultrasonography and plain radiography detected at least one stone in 882 and 488 kidneys, yielding a sensitivity of 88.7% and 49.1%, and a specificity of 68.3% and 99.1%, respectively. Of 488 stones detected by plain radiography, 476 stones were also detected by ultrasound. The combination of the two modalities had a sensitivity of 89.9% and a specificity of 68.1%. The detection rate for plain radiography for stones less than 5 mm was low. Stone sizes measured by the two modalities positively correlated with those obtained by computed tomography, and the concordance rate based on size was similar.

Plain radiography is of limited value for detecting small renal stones.

### Photon-counting detector CT for kidney stone detection in excretory phase ct-comparison between virtual non-contrast and virtual non-iodine reconstructions in a 3D printed kidney phantom [^1139SbLV]. Academic Radiology (2024). High credibility.

To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of contrast media subtraction and kidney stone detection, a virtual non-iodine reconstruction algorithm (VNI; PureCalcium) and a virtual non-contrast (VNC) algorithm were used in excretory phase photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT). This study incorporated a 3D printed kidney phantom under various tube voltages and radiation doses.

A 3D-printed kidney phantom was created to hold Calcium Oxalate (CaOx) and uric acid stones within contrast-enhanced calyces. The calyx density mirrored the average density observed in 200 excretory phase patients (916 HU at 110 kV). Imaging was conducted on a clinical dual-source PCD-CT at 120 kV and 140 kV, with radiation doses set at 5, 10, and 15 mGy. VNI and VNC algorithms were applied. Two blinded readers evaluated image quality and the degree of contrast media and kidney stone subtraction using visual scales. Krippendorff's alpha was calculated to determine inter-reader agreement, and the Chi-squared test was employed for comparing ordinal data.

- **Results**: Reader 2 rated overall image quality higher for VNI than VNC (4.90 vs. 4.00; P < .05). Substantial agreement was observed between readers for contrast media subtraction in both VNC and VNI (Krippendorff's alpha range: 0.628–0.748). Incomplete contrast media subtraction occurred more frequently with VNI for both readers (Reader 1: 29% vs. 15%; P < .05).

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^1166JVYM]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The study concludes that the Hounsfield unit (HU) value of the renal papilla is correlated with recurrence in calcium oxalate stone formers within the cohort. The HU value of the renal papilla may serve as a simple and effective means of identifying patients with a higher risk of stone formation and may facilitate changes in the clinical management of these patients.

We sought to determine the incidence of alternative diagnoses in patients with a history of kidney stones who experience resymptoms and undergo repeat computed tomography (CT) imaging upon their return to the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review of ED patients at a tertiary care hospital. The inclusion criteria consisted of all adult ED patients who received a repeat CT for renal colic after having previously been diagnosed with an obstructive kidney stone, confirmed by CT, in our ED. Patients were identified by reviewing the charts of those with repeat visits to the ED after January 1, 2004, who complained of symptoms suggestive of renal colic and received a CT scan. We determined the frequency of the same diagnosis on repeat CT scans in this population compared with the frequency of alternative diagnoses.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty-one patients met the criteria for the study, with fifty-nine percent being male. One hundred eighty-nine (81.8%) patients had no change in diagnosis as a result of a repeat renal colic CT scan. Twenty-seven (11.6%) patients received an alternative diagnosis that did not require urgent intervention, and 15 (6.5%) patients received a diagnosis that did require urgent intervention.

- **Conclusion**: Repeat CT imaging of patients with known nephrolithiasis changed management in a minority of patients (6.5%). Knowing the frequency of alternative diagnoses in this population may help clinicians and patients balance the risks and benefits of repeat renal colic CT scans in patients with a history of kidney stones.

### Use of the acoustic shadow width to determine kidney stone size with ultrasound [^113TxNuh]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is known to overestimate kidney stone size. We explored measuring the acoustic shadow behind kidney stones combined with different ultrasound imaging modalities to improve stone sizing accuracy.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 45 calcium oxalate monohydrate stones were imaged in vitro at three different depths using three different ultrasound imaging modalities: conventional ray line, spatial compound, and harmonic imaging. The width of the stone and the width of the acoustic shadow were measured by four operators blinded to the true size of the stone.

- **Results**: The average error between the measured and true stone width was 1.4 ± 0.8 mm, 1.7 ± 0.9 mm, and 0.9 ± 0.8 mm for ray line, spatial compound, and harmonic imaging, respectively. The average error between the shadow width and true stone width was 0.2 ± 0.7 mm, 0.4 ± 0.7 mm, and 0.0 ± 0.8 mm for ray line, spatial compound, and harmonic imaging, respectively. The sizing error based on the stone width worsened with greater depth (p < 0.001), while the sizing error based on the shadow width was independent of depth.

- **Conclusions**: Shadow width was a more accurate measure of true stone size than a direct measurement of the stone in the ultrasound image (p < 0.0001). The ultrasound imaging modality also impacted the measurement accuracy. All methods performed similarly for shadow size, with harmonic imaging being the most accurate stone size modality. Overall, 78% of the shadow sizes were accurate to within 1 mm, which is similar to the resolution obtained with clinical computerized tomography.

### Clinical characteristics of ureteral calculi detected by nonenhanced computerized tomography after unclear results of plain radiography and ultrasonography [^1177aDmB]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Prospective non-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) was performed for patients presenting with renal colic and showing negative or equivocal results on plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) as well as ultrasonography (US) to evaluate the usefulness of plain CT. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of urinary calculi detected under such conditions.

Between January 2000 and June 2002, 560 patients presented with acute unilateral renal colic. Of these patients, 238 were negative or equivocal for ureteral calculus on KUB and US and underwent non-enhanced CT. The diagnostic value of plain CT in patients with negative or equivocal KUB and US was determined, and results and other clinical findings were compared. Clinical characteristics of ureteral stones detected by plain CT were compared with those of stones diagnosed by KUB and US.

By plain CT, 143 (60.1%) and 6 (2.5%) cases of pain were determined to have been caused by ureteral stones and other pathogeneses, respectively. No definitive diagnosis was obtained in 89 (37.4%). Stone size detected by plain CT was significantly smaller than controls (3.77 vs. 6.37 mm, p < 0.0001) and tended to be located in the middle or lower ureter (76.2% or 109 of 143 vs. 52.2% or 168 of 322, p < 0.0001). Symptoms spontaneously improved in 137 (95.8%) after conservative therapy while 6 underwent intervention, a rate significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than controls (32.9% or 106 of 322).

Non-enhanced CT is a useful modality for the diagnosis of patients presenting with acute renal colic.

### Progress in the use of helical CT for imaging urinary calculi [^113stMui]. Journal of Endourology (2004). Low credibility.

Helical CT has become the preferred method to diagnose urinary calculi in patients presenting with abdominal or flank pain. Recent in vitro studies have shown that CT can also display the internal structure in stones with remarkable detail. Because some stones respond better to SWL than others, knowing the stone structure at diagnosis could be helpful in choosing among treatment options. This paper examines the potential for CT to be used in this way.

Older CT technology proved problematic; all studies using low-resolution CT suffer from an artifact where stone size affects apparent CT attenuation values. Thus, the observation that stones with low measured CT attenuation break more easily than stones with high attenuation could be entirely attributable to an artifact of stone size. Most stones are composed of more than one mineral, and heterogeneity of composition may contribute to variability in stone response to SWL. Older technology is not useful in evaluating stone composition, but emerging CT machines have sufficient resolution to determine the composition and structure of stones inside the patient, provided proper viewing windows are used.

Continuing improvement in image resolution in helical CT promises to provide information about stone composition and structure that will ultimately lead to better care for patients with stone disease.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound versus conventional ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with a non-dilated collecting system: results of a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114enw3W]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urolithiasis is one of the most prevalent diseases of the urinary system, and its incidence continues to increase every year. According to the American Urological Association, most patients with staghorn renal stones and larger kidney stones (> 20 mm) should be recommended percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) as their first treatment option. Compared with other open surgical methods, PCNL has a more efficient stone clearance rate and is less invasive. However, PCNL has a potential for serious complications, such as bleeding and injury to peripheral organs. Consequently, precise needle puncture of the kidney is the most critical stage in PCNL surgery.

Fluoroscopic guidance, traditionally used for renal access, can accurately identify the calyx to be punctured. A significant disadvantage of fluoroscopic guidance is its inability to visualize adjacent organs in real time, which increases the risk of damaging surrounding structures. Additionally, exposure to ionizing radiation emitted by this method can harm patients and healthcare professionals. By contrast, ultrasound-guided renal puncture has effectively demonstrated efficacy and safety as an alternative to X-ray guidance, reducing radiation hazards while providing real-time guidance.

However, for young physicians, the learning curve of ultrasound-guided PCNL is more prolonged, especially when dealing with an unexpanded renal collecting system, and the degree of calyceal puncture visualization is low. Clinical practice has found that using large amounts of saline to create artificial hydronephrosis causes completion of the procedure.

### External validation of the STONE score, a clinical prediction rule for ureteral stone: An observational multi-institutional study [^114j7opz]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal CT has become the most frequently used imaging test for suspected kidney stone because of its perceived superior diagnostic accuracy and ability to identify important alternative diagnoses, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis. Despite a significant increase in the use of CT scans for patients with suspected kidney stones, there has been no demonstrable improvement in patient outcomes. A recent national survey described a 10-fold increase in CT use from 1996 to 2007 for suspected kidney stones, without associated increases in kidney stone diagnoses, important alternative diagnoses, or hospitalization of kidney stone patients. Furthermore, abdominal CT entails radiation exposure with an attendant cancer risk, is associated with increased ED length of stay, and contributes to increasing annual care costs for acute nephrolithiasis, estimated in excess of $5 billion. If the STONE score is found to identify patients with ureteral stones with sufficient accuracy without relying on further imaging, it could significantly improve the evaluation of patients with suspected nephrolithiasis.

- **Goals of this investigation**: We sought to determine whether the STONE score could be used to safely decrease CT scan use in patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. Using data from a recently completed multicenter randomized trial comparing CT scans to ultrasonography for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis, we determined the discrimination, calibration, and test characteristics of the STONE score to predict ureteral stones. In addition, we compared the test characteristics.

### Detection of residual stones after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: Role of nonenhanced spiral computerized tomography [^111TVuQr]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

We addressed the impact of stone density and size on the role of computerized tomography for diagnosing residual stones after percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively evaluated 100 renal units that underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The study included 55 opaque and 45 lucent or faint stones. Patients were examined after the procedure by plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, linear tomography, ultrasound, and spiral computerized tomography. Minute residual stones were defined as 1 or 2 caliceal stones less than 5 mm, as measured by computerized tomography.

- **Results**: Stone-free status was achieved in 38 renal units. Minute and significant residual stones were detected in 26 and 36 renal units, respectively. For faint and lucent stones, sensitivity for overall stone detection was 100% for computerized tomography, 11.1% for plain x-ray, 22.2% for linear tomography, and 22.2% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). Sensitivity for detecting significant residual stones was 100% for computerized tomography, 20% for plain x-ray, 33.3% for linear tomography, and 20% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). For opaque stones, sensitivity for overall stone detection was 100% for computerized tomography, 62.9% for plain x-ray, 74.3% for linear tomography, and 48.6% for ultrasound (p < 0.05). Sensitivity for detecting significant residual stones was 100% for computerized tomography, 85.7% for plain x-ray (p not significant), 95.2% for linear tomography (p not significant), and 57.1% for ultrasound (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Computerized tomography provides the most sensitive detection method for residual stones.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^114GBXc3]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Other studies demonstrated that kidney stone size influences the detection rate on VNC. In line with these studies, we found a difference in size between visible and invisible stones, as well as a positive correlation between stone size and detectability. Considering a general cut-off for insignificant stones of ≤ 5 mm as described by guidelines, our results showed significantly better detectability for stones > 5 mm, which remained as high as 85% on VNC 1000HU. Yet, it must be mentioned that stones smaller than 5 mm might also cause symptoms and might not pass spontaneously, although up to 95% of kidney stones smaller than 4 mm pass spontaneously. More precise detection of small stones may be diagnostic in the scenario of unclear hematuria, irrespective of the impact on treatment.

Furthermore, previous studies reported an underestimation of kidney stone size on VNC compared to true non-contrast images due to over-subtraction of small stones or the peripheral stone along with the iodine signal. In contrast, CT-based stone size in this study was generally overestimated compared to Man-M, which is, for example, discrepant to an earlier ex-vivo study by Lazar et al. using a DSCT system. They performed 2D-based size measurements on axial reconstructions and included smaller stones with a diameter of 2.4 ± 1.1 mm, where over-subtraction may have a higher influence on size measurements. A possible explanation for this behavior might lie in the different scanner techniques and post-processing capabilities used between the studies.

### Comparison of ultrasound versus computed tomography for the detection of kidney stones in the pediatric population: a clinical effectiveness study [^113GURr7]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of pediatric nephrolithiasis in the United States is increasing; however, there is a paucity of literature comparing the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) to computed tomography (CT) in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: To determine the diagnostic performance of renal US for nephrolithiasis in children using a clinical effectiveness approach.

- **Materials and methods**: Institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent was obtained for this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant investigation. Billing records and imaging reports were used to identify children (≤ 18 years old) evaluated for nephrolithiasis by both US and unenhanced CT within 24 hours between March 2012 and March 2017. Imaging reports were reviewed for the presence, number, size, and location of kidney stones. The diagnostic performance of US (reference standard = CT) was calculated per renal unit (left/right kidney) and per renal sector (four sectors per kidney). For sector analysis, US was considered truly positive if a stone was identified at CT in the same or an adjacent sector.

- **Results**: There were 68 renal stones identified by CT in 30 out of 69 patients (43%). The mean patient age was 14.7 ± 3.6 years, and 35 were boys. For detecting nephrolithiasis in any kidney, US was 66.7% (48.8–80.8%) sensitive and 97.4% (86.8–99.9%) specific, with a positive predictive value of 95.2% [77.3–99.8%] and a negative predictive value of 79.2% [65.7–88.3%]. The positive likelihood ratio was 26.0. Per renal sector, US was 59.7% (46.7–71.4%) sensitive and 97.4% (95.5–98.5%) specific, with a positive predictive value of 72.3% [58.2–83.1%].

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^111QFEwU]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Renal stone disease is common in Europe, with a prevalence ranging between 2% and 8%. It affects relatively young individuals with an almost equal sex ratio and a high tendency to recur, with estimates suggesting that almost 50% of stone patients will present with recurrence within 10 years. Renal colics are secondary to ureteral obstruction by the stones. They are a common cause of visits to the Emergency Department and frequently require imaging evaluation.

In most institutions, non-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is considered the gold standard technique to evaluate these patients because of its accuracy in the detection of stones as well as other pathological conditions mimicking renal colic. According to The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, it is also considered the first imaging technique for evaluating patients with the acute onset of flank pain. MDCT also allows an overall assessment of the 'stone load', which can help plan treatment. However, the vast majority of stones pass spontaneously, and CT imaging in the emergency department rarely alters immediate management.

Moreover, concerns about the over-utilization of CT are growing because of increasing healthcare costs and, more importantly, exposure to ionizing radiation. The use of low-dose techniques can dramatically reduce the radiation dose, but these low-dose protocols have not been adopted worldwide. On the other hand, ultrasound (US) is a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive technique able to evaluate patients with renal colic.

### Limited field noncontrast computerized tomography for followup of ureteral stones: Initial results [^116c9SoE]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to its high specificity and sensitivity, noncontrast computerized tomography is increasingly used to diagnose and follow patients with ureteral stones. This study evaluated the feasibility of limited field noncontrast computerized tomography to monitor patients with ureteral stones.

- **Materials and methods**: The study included 71 patients who underwent diagnostic and followup noncontrast computerized tomography due to ureteral stones. Based on the stone position on the initial diagnostic scan, a limited field batch from the followup scan was created and reviewed by an independent radiologist. Radiation doses and rates of potentially missed findings in the batch were compared to those of the full followup noncontrast scan.

- **Results**: The average full followup noncontrast computerized tomography length was 46.5 cm, while the average batch length was 20.7 cm for proximal stones and 13.8 cm for distal stones. The average full followup noncontrast scan radiation dose was 12.2 mSv. Average batch doses were 6.1 mSv for proximal stones and 4.1 mSv for distal stones (p = 0.002), resulting in radiation exposure reductions of 48.8% for proximal stones and 66% for distal stones. In 3 cases, additional clinical information (not including hydronephrosis) was missed when relying only on batch images. This missing information did not impact further urological treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Limited field noncontrast computerized tomography is a feasible option for monitoring patients diagnosed with ureteral stones, potentially leading to significantly lower radiation exposure.

### Determining the true burden of kidney stone disease [^114xZesX]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of kidney stones have increased over the past four decades. However, the diagnosis of 'kidney stone' can range from an incidental asymptomatic finding of limited clinical significance to multiple painful episodes of ureteral obstruction with eventual kidney failure. Some general strategies may be useful to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. In particular, greater attention to kidney stone classification, approaches to assessing the risk of recurrence, and individualized prevention strategies may improve the clinical care of stone formers.

Although there have been some advances in approaches to predicting the recurrence of kidney stones, notable challenges remain. Studies of kidney stone prevalence, incidence, and recurrence have reported inconsistent findings, in part because of the lack of a standardized stone classification system. A kidney stone classification system based on practical and clinically useful measures of stone disease may help to improve both the study and clinical care of stone formers. Any future kidney stone classification system should aim to distinguish asymptomatic from symptomatic stones, clinically diagnosed symptomatic stone episodes from self-reported symptomatic stone episodes, symptomatic stone episodes that are confirmed from those that are suspected, symptomatic recurrence from radiographic recurrence (that is, with radiographic evidence of a new stone, stone growth, or stone disappearance from presumed passage), and determine stone composition based on mutually exclusive categories.

### Ultra-low-dose CT: An effective follow-up imaging modality for ureterolithiasis [^113PxCYL]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Classically, abdominal X-ray (KUB), ultrasound, or a combination of both have been routinely used for ureteral stone surveillance after initial diagnosis. More recently, ultra-low-dose CT (ULD CT) has emerged as a CT technique that reduces radiation dose while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity for urinary stone detection. We aim to evaluate our initial experience with ULD CT for patients with ureterolithiasis, measuring real-world radiation doses and stone detection performance.

- **Methods**: We reviewed all ULD CT scans performed at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System between 2016 and 2018. We included patients with ureteral stones and calculated the mean effective radiation dose per scan. We determined stone location and size, if the stone was visible on the associated KUB or CT scout film, and if hydronephrosis was present. We performed logistic regression to identify variables associated with visibility on KUB or CT scout film and hydronephrosis.

- **Results**: One hundred eighteen ULD scans were reviewed, of which 50 detected ureteral stones. The mean effective radiation dose was 1.04 ± 0.41 mSv. Of the ULD CTs that detected ureterolithiasis, 38% lacked visibility on KUB/CT scout film and had no associated hydronephrosis, suggesting that they would be missed with a combination of KUB and ultrasound. Larger stones (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.96 for every 1 mm increase in stone size) were more likely to be detected by KUB/CT scout film or ultrasound, while stones in the distal ureter (OR: 0.18, 95% CI).

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^114KxA3e]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Another unique feature of our study was the relationship between renal papillary CT values and 24-hour urine chemistries. Although only one previous study reported the relationship between renal papillae CT attenuation values and 24-hour urine chemistry, there was no correlation between papillary density and hypercalciuria. We also found no significant difference in daily urinary calcium excretion or AP (CaOx) index between the high and low renal papillary CT groups.

There are several limitations in regard to our study. First, the number of patients was small, and more patients are required to reach a stronger conclusion. Second, we targeted only patients with calcium stones, while many previous studies have examined not only patients with calcium stones but also healthy controls. Third, the follow-up period was rather short (3.5–4.0 years). Longer-term observations will yield more accurate results.

However, our study showed that measurement of HU of renal papillae is useful not only for screening future stone patients within the general public but also in establishing follow-up plans for present patients with stones after treatment.

### EAU guidelines on diagnosis and conservative management of urolithiasis [^111rED3m]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) has become the first choice for detecting ureteral calculi. Conservative observational management of renal stones is possible; however, the availability of minimally invasive treatment often leads to active intervention. Acute renal colic due to ureteral stone obstruction is an emergency condition that requires immediate pain management. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral stones can support spontaneous passage in the absence of complicating factors. These guidelines summarize recommendations for imaging, pain management, conservative treatment, and MET for renal and ureteral stones. Oral chemolysis is an option for uric acid stones.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the optimal measures for diagnosis and conservative and medical treatment of urolithiasis.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Several databases were searched for studies on imaging, pain management, observation, and MET for urolithiasis, with particular attention to the level of evidence.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Most patients with urolithiasis present with typical colic symptoms, but stones in the renal calices remain asymptomatic. Routine evaluation includes ultrasound imaging as the first-line modality. In acute disease, low-dose CT is the method of choice. Ureteral stones less than 6mm can pass spontaneously in well-controlled patients. Sufficient pain management is mandatory in acute renal colic. MET, usually with α-receptor antagonists, facilitates stone passage and reduces the need for analgesia. Contrast imaging is advised for accurate determination of renal anatomy.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^1159zF5N]. European radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Phantom design

For all examinations, the stones were placed on a layer of gelatine (Oetker) exhibiting water-equivalent HU within polystyrene 24-well plates (surface area 1.9 cm 2; Corning Inc, to ensure a sufficient distance to the base plate for accurate stone size assessment using semi-automatic segmentation. The well plates were then filled with increasing amounts of iohexol (Accupaque, GE Healthcare) in water yielding an iodine-induced attenuation of 0 HU, 200 HU, 400 HU, 600 HU, 800 HU, 1000 HU, and 1500 HU. Corresponding contrast media/water ratios were calculated based on a linear formula derived from a prior performed dilution series. The well plates were placed on a platform in a plastic box filled with water (width x height: 280 x 200 mm), which was positioned along the z-axis on the CT table and centrally within the gantry (Fig. 1). The procedure was repeated for each scan with a different iodine-induced attenuation. In between each scan with increasing iodine-induced attenuation, kidney stones were washed in saline to minimize possible absorption and accumulation of contrast media on the surface of the stones. Prior to each scan, a test scan of the different contrast media/water mixtures was acquired to ensure accurate iodine-induced attenuation and mixtures were adjusted if necessary. Attenuation values were quantified by placing two circular regions of interest within the mixtures. Here, attenuation values ± 10 HU of the desired iodine-induced attenuation were considered sufficient (ESM 1).

### Imaging patients with renal colic — consider ultrasound first [^116sAEYS]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

CT has become the imaging study of choice for renal colic due to its high sensitivity in detecting renal and ureteral stones. Moreover, when CT is performed with dual energy, it helps characterize the composition of the renal stones. However, most hospitals do not have this technology, which, in addition, has very limited usefulness in the case of ureteral stones. CT can identify the presence and size of stones with a very high accuracy of over 95% and is able to detect alternative diagnoses that simulate renal colic in 5–10% of patients. Nonetheless, despite its high accuracy, there is increasing concern about the rise in healthcare costs and radiation risks that accompany CT scans, since the use of CT rarely changes the treatment plans of these patients.

In this context, a recent retrospective study by Westphalen et al. determined the proportion of patient visits for flank or kidney pain receiving CT or ultrasound (US) and calculated the diagnosis and hospitalization rates for urolithiasis. From 1996 to 2007, the use of CT to assess patients with suspected urolithiasis increased from 4.0 to 42.5% over the study period, while the use of US remained low, at about 5%. However, the diagnosis of kidney stones, identification of significant alternate diagnoses, or admission to the hospital did not increase.

The problem of exposure to radiation is very important in these patients, especially due to the possibility of cumulative radiation that is not usually well assessed when multiple CTs are performed in repetitive episodes of renal colic. Thus, the use of dedicated low-dose CT protocols is advised to mitigate such risks.

### Tools to improve the accuracy of kidney stone sizing with ultrasound [^116L7TFQ]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overestimation of stone size using ultrasound (US) compared with computed tomography (CT) in an in vitro water bath model and to investigate methods to reduce this overestimation.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten human stones, ranging from 3 to 12 mm, were measured using B-mode (brightness mode) US by a sonographer who was blinded to the true stone size. Images were captured and compared using both a commercial US machine and a software-based research US device. Image gain was adjusted between moderate and high stone intensities, and the transducer-to-stone depth was varied from 6 to 10 cm. A computerized stone-sizing program was developed to outline the stone width based on a grayscale intensity threshold.

- **Results**: Overestimation with the commercial device increased with both gain and depth. The average overestimation at moderate and high gain was 1.9 ± 0.8 mm and 2.1 ± 0.9 mm, respectively (p = 0.6). Overestimation increased an average of 22% with every 2-cm increase in depth (p = 0.02). Overestimation using the research device was 1.5 ± 0.9 mm and did not vary with depth (p = 0.28). Overestimation could be reduced to 0.02 ± 1.1 mm (p < 0.001) with the computerized stone-sizing program. However, a standardized threshold consistent across different depths, systems, or system settings could not be resolved.

In conclusion, stone size is consistently overestimated with US. Overestimation increased with increasing depth and gain using the commercial machine. It was reduced and did not vary with depth when using the software-based US device. The computerized stone-sizing program significantly decreased overestimation, though a universally consistent threshold could not be established.

### Radiological imaging of patients with suspected urinary tract stones: National trends, diagnoses, and predictors [^1123vwPa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The overutilization of computed tomography (CT) is a growing public health concern due to increasing healthcare costs and exposure to radiation; these factors must be weighed against the potential benefits of CT for improving diagnoses and treatment plans. The objective of this study was to determine the national trends of CT and ultrasound (US) utilization for the assessment of suspected urolithiasis in emergency departments (EDs) and whether these trends are accompanied by changes in diagnosis rates for urolithiasis or other significant disorders and hospitalization rates.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ED visits from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) between 1996 and 2007. Researchers determined the proportion of patient visits for flank or kidney pain receiving CT or US testing and calculated the diagnosis and hospitalization rates for urolithiasis and other significant disorders. Patient-specific and hospital-level variables associated with the use of CT were examined.

- **Results**: Utilization of CT to assess patients with suspected urolithiasis increased from 4.0% to 42.5% over the study period (p < 0.05). Admission to the hospital (approximately 11%, p = 0.49) did not change significantly. The following characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving CT.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^1154w8QX]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bladder stones, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend performing cystoscopy or obtaining a CT or kidney-ureter-bladder X-ray for the evaluation of patients with persistent symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone, if an ultrasound is negative.

### Diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for characterization of kidney lesions in patients with and without chronic kidney disease [^115qTAUo]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of kidney lesions by ultrasound has historically been limited by the lack of enhancement. Contrast-enhanced CT/MR has been the imaging standard. However, iodinated contrast agents may worsen kidney function, and gadolinium agents may cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with advanced CKD. The primary goal of this pilot study was to explore the detection of microbubble contrast in kidney lesions among patients with and without CKD and to test the accuracy of CEUS for characterizing these lesions as malignant or benign (Fig. 3). We found that the sensitivity of CEUS, whether compared to tissue diagnosis or follow-up imaging, is high and comparable to the reported sensitivities of CT (83–100%) and MR (81–100%) among patients with and without CKD. High sensitivity provides high certainty that a negative test in an individual means the individual does not have the disease, essentially ruling out malignancy.

- **Complex cystic lesions**:
	- In two patients with chronic kidney disease of different severity, sagittal CEUS images revealed complex cystic lesions, classified as Bosniak IV by both readers (long arrows). Mural nodularity (dashed arrows) is present in both cysts. Both lesions were confirmed as RCC on pathology.
	- **However, at different stages**: The 72-year-old woman in Fig. 3a had early kidney disease, and the non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma (short arrow) in this case demonstrates homogeneous enhancement. Fig. 3b depicts a case of a 67-year-old man with advanced kidney disease on dialysis. In this case, the kidney parenchyma appears very different, demonstrating reduced, patchy enhancement.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^114B88UM]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Hematuria and urolithiasis rank among the most common urologic diagnoses, with urolithiasis being one of the leading causes of hematuria. While the prevalence of hematuria has been reported between 2.4% and 31.1%, the lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis is approximately 15% in developed countries. In patients with suspected urolithiasis, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is recommended. For patients with hematuria and a high risk for genitourinary malignancy, multiphasic CT is advised by international guidelines authored by the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association, respectively. Due to the rising prevalence of urolithiasis and a high rate of recurrence of up to 50%, limiting radiation exposure in these and other urologic patients is a major concern.

In recent decades, technical advances have allowed for extensive investigations regarding the reduction of radiation dose in computed tomography. This has led to the implementation of low-dose scanning protocols for patients with suspected urolithiasis in international guidelines by the EAU. On the contrary, the radiation dose of multiphasic CT in patients with hematuria, including a non-contrast, parenchymal, and excretory phase, still exhibits a high radiation dose. Here, virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) of the excretory phase derived from dual-energy CT systems have shown promising results in urinary stone detection to replace true non-contrast scans. More recently, split-bolus protocols have been described to further reduce radiation dose by combining the parenchymal and excretory phases.

### Sensitivity of noncontrast computed tomography for small renal calculi with endoscopy as the gold standard [^116KU2Qo]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

To compare the sensitivity of noncontrast computed tomography (CT) with endoscopy for detection of renal calculi. Imaging modalities for detection of nephrolithiasis have centered on abdominal x-ray, ultrasound, and noncontrast CT. Sensitivities of 58%-62% (abdominal x-ray), 45% (ultrasound), and 95%-100% (CT) have been previously reported; however, these results have never been correlated with endoscopic findings.

- **Methods**: Idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers with symptomatic calculi requiring ureteroscopy were studied. At the time of surgery, the number and the location of all calculi within the kidney were recorded followed by basket retrieval. Each calculus was measured and sent for micro-CT and infrared spectrophotometry. All CT scans were reviewed by the same genitourinary radiologist who was blinded to the endoscopic findings. The radiologist reported on the number, location, and size of each calculus.

- **Results**: Eighteen renal units were studied in 11 patients. The average time from CT scan to ureteroscopy was 28.6 days. The mean number of calculi identified per kidney was 9.2 ± 6.1 for endoscopy and 5.9 ± 4.1 for CT (p < 0.004). The mean size of total renal calculi (sum of the longest stone diameters) per kidney was 22.4 ± 17.1mm and 18.2 ± 13.2mm for endoscopy and CT, respectively (P = 0.06).

- **Conclusion**: CT scan underreports the number of renal calculi, probably missing some small stones and being unable to distinguish those lying in close proximity to one another; however, the total stone burden seen by CT is, on average, accurate when compared with that found on endoscopy.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^111Z17UL]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effects of differing degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation dose on the detection rate and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast (VNC) obtained from dual-layer computed tomography (DLCT). We found that the overall detection rate consistently decreased with increasing iodine-induced attenuation, remaining comparable to true non-contrast scans on VNC ≤ 400 HU even when using a low-dose technique. The detection rate was higher in the high-dose protocol compared to the low-dose protocol and was comparable between both protocols on VNC ≤ 600 HU. Kidney stone size influenced detection rates and was generally overestimated. Stones larger than 5 mm were detected more effectively than those 5 mm or smaller, while the detection rate remained comparable on VNC ≤ 800 HU.

The reported data demonstrate the beneficial value of VNC derived from dual-energy CT in imaging hematuria and urolithiasis. VNC has the potential to replace the true non-contrast scan in multiphasic CT protocols, resulting in a reduction of radiation dose while maintaining a high detection rate of kidney stones, considering observed limitations. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the detection of kidney stones on VNC derived from DLCT, while most published in vivo studies used rapid-switching rather than dual-source dual-energy CT (DECT). A direct translation of the presented results to other DECT systems is limited due to different technical aspects, such as a reported variation in iodine quantification accuracy.

### Asymptomatic urolithiasis in living donor transplant kidneys: Initial results [^112S7FUj]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

During the preoperative evaluation of potential kidney donors, the increased sensitivity of spiral computed tomography (CT) could detect more asymptomatic small (less than 4 mm) renal calculi. However, whether these stones will be of consequence later has yet to be determined. We evaluated the rate of spontaneous passage, development of symptoms, and change in the size of asymptomatic renal calculi in donor kidneys transplanted without removal of the calculi.

- **Methods**: Five donor kidneys from living donors were transplanted with small (less than 4 mm), asymptomatic renal calculi incidentally detected on CT (eight stones). No donors had any metabolic derangements or history of previous lithiasis. Each kidney was laparoscopically removed and transplanted with the calculi in situ. The recipients were followed up with serial creatinine measurements, history taking, and CT scans.

- **Results**: None of the recipients had any symptoms consistent with the progression of disease, including hydronephrosis, renal failure, or the elevation of serum creatinine at a mean follow-up of 711 ± 334 days. The follow-up CT scans showed spontaneous passage of the stones in 3 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, two of the stones remained stable, and one had increased in size from 1 to 2 mm. Those with the stones remaining had a significantly shorter length of follow-up (204 ± 72 versus 711 ± 200 days, P < 0.05).

In our series of 5 patients with small asymptomatic renal calculi, none of the patients had complications, and only three of the eight stones passed spontaneously.

### Renal stone detection using unenhanced multidetector row computerized tomography — does section width matter [^114ZTdTv]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We determined the effect of reconstructed section width on sensitivity and specificity for detecting renal calculi using multidetector row computerized tomography. Three to five renal stones, 2 to 4 mm in size, were randomly placed into 14 human cadaveric kidneys and scanned by 16-row detector computerized tomography at 1.25 mm collimation and identical scanning parameters. After acquisition, images were reconstructed with section widths of 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 mm, and reviewed independently by two blinded radiologists. Comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between different section widths were assessed with the McNemar test and Cochran's Q statistics.

Specificity was not significantly affected by section width (94.6% to 97.7%). In contrast, sensitivity increased as stone size increased and as section width decreased. Sensitivity to detect all stones was 80.7%, 80.7%, 87.7%, and 92.1% for 5.0, 3.75, 2.5, and 1.25 mm section widths, respectively. Interobserver agreement for stone detection was excellent (kappa 0.858). Although the 2.0 mm stone detection rate improved with thinner section widths (79.4% vs. 52.9% for 1.25 vs. 5.0 mm, p = 0.004), stones greater than 2.0 mm were similarly detected at different slice selections (p = 0.056 to 0.572).

Independent of other scanning parameters, reconstruction section width influences the ability to detect small renal calculi. It must be considered when creating computerized tomography protocols.

### Kidney and uro-trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^115wSGvk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for kidney trauma, specifically concerning ultrasound, the AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend not obtaining ultrasound with or without contrast enhancement or echo-Doppler in the initial evaluation of adult patients who have experienced high-energy trauma with suspected multiple injuries and/or injury to the urinary tract and collecting system.

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^111nk4Tz]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of CaOx stone formers who underwent non-contrast CT scans and 24-hour urine chemistry between September 2012 and November 2021 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital, Japan, and who were followed up for at least one year. Stone analysis was performed by infrared spectroscopy. Ideally, CaOx stones should be subdivided into CaOx monohydrate and CaOx dihydrate. Unfortunately, there are no Japanese laboratories that report CaOx monohydrate and CaOx dihydrate separately, so in this study, the two were combined and analyzed as CaOx. We excluded patients with radiolucent stones, with pure calcium phosphate stones, and with non-calcium stones. This study was approved by the Wakayama Medical University Institutional Review Board (No. 3037), and all procedures were performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Since this is a retrospective observational study, a clinical trial number is not applicable.

- **Measurement of CT attenuation value of renal papilla**: CT scans were performed as standard with 5 mm collimation width using a LightSpeed 64-slice multidetector helical CT scanner at 0.5 seconds per rotation, 120 kV, and 100 mA. CT images (slice thickness 2.5–5 mm) were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced urologists who were blinded to patient clinical data. The Hounsfield unit (HU) of the renal papilla was independently measured by two observers by placing regions of interest (ROI) with a mean size of 0.2 cm² in the region of renal papillae from the upper pole, middle region, and lower pole in both kidneys.

### Imaging advances in urolithiasis [^116CA3qi]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of urinary stones in the United States has been described as 1 in 11 persons reporting a history of stones. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, management, and follow-up for these patients, and imaging technology over the last 100 years has advanced as the disease prevalence has increased. CT remains the gold standard for imaging urolithiasis, and changes in this technology, with the addition of multidetector CT and dual-energy CT, as well as changes in the utilization of CT, have decreased the radiation dose encountered by patients and allowed for improved stone detection.

Use of digital tomography has been introduced for the follow-up of recurrent stone formers, offering the potential to lower radiation exposure over the course of a patient's lifelong treatment. However, there is still a demand for improved imaging techniques to detect smaller stones and stones in larger patients at lower radiation doses, as well as the continued need for the judicious use of all imaging modalities for healthcare cost containment and patient safety.

### Recent finding and new technologies in nephrolitiasis: A review of the recent literature [^111UX3ZG]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing diagnostic imaging may receive excessive doses of radiation during initial diagnostic and follow-up evaluations. Renal collecting systems can be illustrated more precisely with the advent of multi-detector row CT through thinner slices, high-speed acquisitions, and enhanced longitudinal spatial resolution resulting in improved reformatted coronal images. On the other hand, a significant increase in exposure to ionizing radiation, especially in radiosensitive organs such as the gonads, is a concern with the increased utilization of urinary tract CT.

Few studies have investigated the effective radiation dose associated with an acute stone episode and short-term follow-up. Ferrandino et al, in a single-institution study, found that 205 patients received a dose greater than 20 mSv. John et al. found a median radiation dose per stone episode of 5.3 mSv, with higher doses in those with renal stones and those who required CT scans and other interventions. Ferrandino suggests that urologists must be cognizant of the radiation exposure to patients and seek alternative imaging strategies to minimize radiation dosages during acute and long-term stone management.

In the US, around 60 million CT scans are performed every year, raising concern about the amount of radiation delivered. Thus, different lower-dose radiation protocols were proposed. Results show a high efficacy of lower-dose CT. Unfortunately, studies defined standard and low-dose protocols differently. A standard protocol uses about 180 mAs, while a low-dose protocol would be performed with less.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^117GnFPB]. Nature Reviews Urology (2016). High credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and an initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality to evaluate patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation.

Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT but does not require the use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial, they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Both modalities have their advantages and disadvantages.

- **KUB plain film radiography**: Most helpful in evaluating interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease; less useful in the setting of acute stones.

- **MRI**: Provides the possibility of 3D imaging without exposure to radiation, but it is costly and currently stones are difficult to visualize.

Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones, in light of the guidelines and a randomized controlled trial, could aid clinicians.

### Ct, US and MRI of xanthine urinary stones: in-vitro and in-vivo analyses [^1114WqCR]. BMC Urology (2020). High credibility.

Xanthine urinary stones are a rare type of urinary calculus that may cause symptoms requiring numerous imaging tests over a lifetime. In-vitro and in-vivo analyses showed that xanthine stones are easily detectable on US and CT, but failed to demonstrate a signal on all MRI sequences tested. CT numbers of xanthine stones did not vary when imaging with different energies. We believe that US should be considered the first-line imaging test in the evaluation of xanthine urinary calculi. Judicious use of CT is warranted when ultrasound is inconclusive or insufficient and risks of radiation have been considered.

### Non-contrast CT attenuation value of renal papilla is a novel predictor of recurrence in kidney stone disease [^111xeoq2]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

A total of 180 patients (114 men, 66 women) were included in the analysis. Stone composition was CaOx in 88 patients (48.9%), CaOx + CaP in 59 patients (32.8%), and unknown in 33 patients (18.3%). Recurrent stone formers and multiple stone formers accounted for 67.8% and 72.6% of the cohort, respectively. Median HU value of all papillae was 38.9, which was used for classification of the patients into either the low-HU group (< 38.9) or high-HU group (≥ 38.9). There was no significant difference in the variability of the data between the high-HU group and the low-HU group.

There were no significant differences in age, gender, or stone composition between the two groups. The proportions of recurrent stone formers and multiple stone formers were also similar between the groups (70.0% vs. 65.6%, 71.1% vs. 74.2%, respectively).

Data on 24-hour urine collection and the AP(CaOx) index are available. Five patients (three in the low-HU group and two in the high-HU group) were excluded from the analysis because they lacked one of the items necessary for the calculation of the AP(CaOx) index. There were no significant differences in urinary volume, urinary excretions of each constituent, or AP(CaOx) index between the low-HU and the high-HU groups.

### Imaging-based deep learning in kidney diseases: recent progress and future prospects [^116G6y11]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Detection of renal calculus

Renal calculi are a common kidney disease and a worldwide health problem, induced by risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. The formation of renal calculi can lead to urinary system obstruction, kidney failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease. In clinical practice, diagnosing renal calculi generally requires imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US) and non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT). Currently, imaging-based deep learning is rapidly developing and is already being applied in these techniques to enhance the detection of renal calculi.

Yildirim et al. developed a coronal CT image-based deep learning model to detect renal calculi on a dataset of 1,453 NCCT images and validated the model on an internal cohort of 346 NCCT images. The proposed cross-residual network model exhibits excellent performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.82%, sensitivity of 95.76%, and specificity of 97% in detecting renal calculi. The study also proposed exploring the detection of kidney stones on axial and sagittal CT images, considering the relation between stone size and detection performance. Caglayan et al. addressed this by dividing the dataset into three groups based on kidney stone size to evaluate the deep learning-assisted model's detection performance on three imaging axes respectively.

### CT for the evaluation of flank pain [^1157qAsw]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologist and urologist, but a number of signs are highly predictive of stone formation. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to convey an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan requires no contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost-effective. It behooves both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^113ikPXY]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

While the health risk attributable to a single CT scan is small, in a country of 310 million people (approximate US population), it is significant to note a lifetime incidence of nephrolithiasis of approximately 10%. If half of these individuals undergo a CT scan to detect nephrolithiasis — likely a conservative estimate as kidney stones are often re-evaluated and many patients undergo multiple CT scans — we could expect 15 million CT scans to be performed on US residents. In addition to the cost of this imaging, it could be estimated that exposure to ionizing radiation from CT would cause between 10,000 and 30,000 additional malignancies, based on risk estimates ranging from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1500 for renal colic CT scans.

In this setting, CT was performed nearly as often in women as in men in both phases of the study (48.1% of CT scans in women in the derivation phase; 44.4% in the validation phase). However, the diagnostic yield (percentage of patients with ureteral stones on CT) for men was much higher: 68.8% in the derivation phase and 66.7% in the validation phase, compared with women (28.7% and 41.7%, respectively). The lower diagnostic yield in women, coupled with a higher risk from radiation of the pelvis with CT, suggests that women (especially younger women) may be a group that could benefit from more judicious use of CT radiation.

### Sensitivity of virtual non-contrast dual-energy CT urogram for detection of urinary calculi: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WsHNB]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Oral hydration, intravenous (IV) hydration (> 250 ml), and IV diuretics are all techniques documented to aid complete opacification of the renal collecting systems on excretory phase acquisition. Thinner slices (< 2 mm) are also documented to improve detection of urinary calculi on tNCT.

A number of studies have been undertaken since 2010 to investigate the potential for vNCT to replace the tNCT phase in DECT urography. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the sensitivity of vNCT, generated from the excretory phase of a CT urogram, compared to tNCT for the detection of urinary calculi.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone — the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^115Esah5]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are estimated to occur at some point in nearly 1 in 11 people in the United States, with flank or kidney pain resulting in over two million annual visits to the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) has been described as the "best imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of a urinary stone" and is now the first-line imaging study for suspected kidney stones in the United States. Though accurate, CT is costly, involves the use of ionizing radiation, and does not seem to have impacted patient-centered outcomes, such as rates of diagnosis or hospital admission in those with suspected kidney stones.

Many patients with flank pain will not benefit from a CT scan, as most kidney stones will pass spontaneously. Moreover, it is unlikely that a CT scan in the setting of flank pain will detect acutely important alternative findings in patients without signs of infection. Hence, an objective clinical prediction rule for renal colic that could reliably identify patients highly likely to have a ureteral stone (and thus unlikely to have an important alternative diagnosis) may allow patients to be safely managed without imaging or imaged with other approaches such as ultrasonography or reduced-dose CT.

We derived and validated a clinical prediction score for ureteral stones that cause symptoms, identifying patients with either a very high or a very low probability of having an uncomplicated ureteral stone. We hypothesized that patients who are highly likely to have a kidney stone are unlikely to harbor an important alternative diagnosis and may be appropriately managed without extensive imaging.

### Helical CT scanning: The primary imaging modality for acute flank pain [^1112eiYs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

We set out to evaluate the accuracy of nonenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) scanning in detecting stones in patients with acute flank pain, as well as its effectiveness in identifying noncalculus causes of such pain. Between April 1995 and April 1997, 412 consecutive patients with acute flank pain underwent noncontrast-enhanced helical CT. Among these, 281 patients had their CT diagnosis confirmed by other radiographic studies, urologic intervention, or the spontaneous passage of calculi.

We determined the presence or absence of urinary calculi and identified other noncalculus pathology. CT scanning revealed a stone in 92 out of 281 patients (32.7%) and no stone in 189 out of 281 patients (67.3%). Of the 189 patients without stones, 60 (32%) were found to have other causes for flank pain. Eighty-one of the 92 patients with a stone on CT (88%) had their stone disease confirmed by radiologic or surgical intervention. Eleven of the 92 patients (12%) did not have confirmation of their diagnosis due to symptom resolution or refusal of further intervention.

In helical CT scans, 129 out of 189 patients demonstrated no abnormalities. Two of these 189 patients (1.5%), thought to be stone-free by CT, eventually passed a stone. Helical CT exhibited a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 88%, and a negative predictive value of 98% in stone detection. Noncontrast-enhanced helical CT is accurate and rapid in detecting calculus disease in patients with acute flank pain. Perhaps more importantly, it provides the added benefit of identifying noncalculus causes of flank pain.
