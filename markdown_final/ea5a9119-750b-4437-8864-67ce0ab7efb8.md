## Question

Rhinovirus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about human rhinovirus, covering virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical spectrum, diagnostics, treatment, prevention, special populations, and research gaps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the virus taxonomy and structure to anchor downstream clinical reasoning. Then, I should verify transmission dynamics and seasonality. Next, I will examine pathogenesis and receptor biology. After that, I need to review the clinical spectrum across ages and comorbidities. I will then assess diagnostics and testing strategies, followed by treatment and prevention, including vaccine prospects. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize key research gaps and takeaways, making sure I double-check any overstatements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the virologic foundation. Human rhinoviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, with three species (A, B, C) comprising over 150 antigenically distinct types, which explains the immense challenge for vaccines and broad diagnostics; historically, HRV-A and HRV-B were defined by seroneutralization, whereas HRV-C was discovered via molecular methods and remains difficult to culture, which has slowed functional studies and vaccine development [^111879Ux] [^112QFUeo] [^112zXDsu].

> Wait, let me verify receptor usage because it links to tissue tropism. HRV-A and many HRV-B strains use ICAM-1 as a receptor, whereas HRV-C uses cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3), a genetic variant of which confers asthma risk and may explain greater lower airway involvement; temperature sensitivity also matters, as many HRVs replicate optimally at 32–34°C, aligning with nasal mucosa, though some strains replicate at 37°C, facilitating lower respiratory tract infection and exacerbations [^115q3tXt] [^1162LeCn] [^113XB2Su].

> I need to check transmission next. HRV spreads via respiratory droplets, aerosols, and contact with contaminated secretions, with efficient hand-to-mucosa inoculation; survival on fingers is concentration dependent, supporting hand hygiene as a key intervention, and children are major reservoirs driving household transmission, with multiple types often circulating simultaneously within families [^112K3dBg] [^112SG4iu] [^111879Ux].

> Hold on, I should verify seasonality before drawing conclusions. HRV circulates year-round with peaks in early fall and spring, and remains the most frequently isolated virus even during summer when overall respiratory illness rates are lower; this pattern contrasts with influenza and RSV, which predominate in winter, and has implications for year-round vigilance in high-risk populations [^114vUEb6] [^117UQSeF].

> Let me consider the epidemiologic burden carefully. HRV is the leading cause of acute respiratory infections globally, responsible for roughly half or more of common colds and a substantial fraction of pediatric ARIs; in children, HRV accounts for about 59% of analyzed ARI episodes, with high rates of otitis media, wheezing, and outpatient visits, and asymptomatic detection occurs in a minority, underscoring true infection rather than colonization in symptomatic contexts [^114vUEb6] [^113DT8V1] [^114kJAX3].

> I will now examine pathogenesis in the upper airway. Infection begins with inoculation to nasal or ocular mucosa, binding to ICAM-1 or CDHR3, followed by replication and epithelial injury; within 10–16 hours, inflammatory mediators and neurogenic pathways generate symptoms that peak at days 2–3 and typically resolve within a week, though cough may persist due to neuronal hypersensitivity even after viral clearance [^115q3tXt] [^1121VbmL].

> But wait, what if the virus reaches the lower airway. HRV can infect the lower respiratory tract, provoking bronchial hyperresponsiveness, neutrophilic inflammation, and impaired mucociliary clearance; in asthma, impaired interferon responses and epithelial barrier dysfunction amplify susceptibility and severity, and experimental inoculation models in asthma and COPD demonstrate that HRV can precipitate clinically meaningful exacerbations with objective declines in lung function [^115AhMzr] [^1148DRNe] [^115pdBKe].

> Next, I should review the clinical spectrum across ages. In otherwise healthy adults, HRV usually causes mild URI with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough; in children, HRV frequently triggers wheezing and is the dominant cause of virus-associated wheeze after the first year of life, while in infants and high-risk groups, HRV can cause bronchiolitis and even pneumonia, with severity modulated by viral load and coinfections [^11784iaW] [^115jEbjS] [^113PWK1z].

> I should double-check the asthma link because it is clinically pivotal. HRV is the most common trigger of asthma exacerbations in children and a major trigger in adults, with wheezing during HRV infection in early childhood conferring a markedly increased risk of subsequent asthma; mechanistically, impaired interferon responses, type 2 inflammation, and interactions with allergen exposure converge to heighten risk and severity [^115jEbjS] [^114kJAX3] [^115FF178].

> Let me verify COPD data before concluding. HRV accounts for roughly 40–65% of COPD exacerbations, with worse symptoms, longer recovery, and higher inflammatory markers when HRV is detected; experimental HRV inoculation in COPD produces clinical colds and measurable falls in peak flow, supporting causality and highlighting HRV as a therapeutic target for exacerbation prevention [^111zXqj6] [^1148DRNe].

> Hold on, I should review severe outcomes in special hosts. In immunocompromised patients, particularly hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, HRV lower respiratory tract infection carries high 90-day mortality comparable to influenza, RSV, or PIV, and in children, HRV is a leading cause of severe LRTI requiring ICU admission, with high rates of oxygen need and mechanical ventilation, especially when viral load is high or coinfections are present [^116Yv77n] [^112u9dGp] [^113PWK1z].

> Next, I should review diagnostics pragmatically. Because no rapid bedside test is widely available, diagnosis is often clinical; RT-PCR is the gold standard with high sensitivity and specificity, and multiplex panels can detect HRV among other respiratory viruses, but detection in asymptomatic individuals complicates interpretation, so results must be integrated with clinical context and timing of illness [^11485gcs] [^115FEure].

> Wait, let me verify testing indications. Routine HRV testing is not universally recommended, but in young children with ARI, severe wheeze, or ICU-level illness, testing can aid management and antimicrobial stewardship; some experts advocate including HRV in pediatric respiratory testing panels given its burden and potential severity, acknowledging that detection does not always equal causation [^115rpquw] [^115FEure].

> I need to ensure treatment guidance is precise. There are no approved antivirals for HRV; management is supportive with analgesics, antipyretics, hydration, and local decongestants, and antibiotics should be avoided unless bacterial coinfection is suspected; pleconaril showed in vitro activity and underwent trials but is not licensed, underscoring the need for early, pathogen-directed therapy if antivirals are to be effective in the future [^112puGvh] [^11784iaW].

> Let me reconsider prevention, because this is where action is feasible. Hand hygiene remains the cornerstone, with added benefits from masking during outbreaks, physical distancing, and environmental controls; human challenge and household studies reinforce the centrality of hand-to-mucosa transmission and the disproportionate role of children in spread, supporting targeted hygiene and isolation in congregate settings [^112K3dBg] [^112SG4iu] [^111thJex].

> I should confirm vaccine prospects before overpromising. The antigenic diversity of > 150 types across three species has stymied vaccine development, though preclinical polyvalent approaches and epitope-targeted strategies are being explored; until vaccines exist, prevention relies on nonpharmaceutical measures and optimizing vaccines for other respiratory viruses to reduce overall morbidity and healthcare strain [^115oznB9] [^113vcGMy] [^112zXDsu].

> Next, I should review special populations systematically. In pediatrics, HRV dominates ARI etiologies, drives wheeze and otitis media, and contributes substantially to ED visits and hospitalizations; in asthma, HRV is the principal exacerbation trigger and early-life wheeze with HRV is a potent asthma risk factor; in COPD, HRV triggers a large fraction of exacerbations with worse clinical trajectories; in immunocompromised hosts, HRV LRTI carries high mortality, warranting aggressive supportive care and infection control [^113DT8V1] [^115jEbjS] [^111zXqj6] [^116Yv77n].

> Hold on, I should verify the SARS-CoV-2 interaction because it is topical. Recent human and modeling data suggest that recent HRV infection can induce interferon-mediated protection that reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication and incident infection, offering a plausible explanation for lower COVID-19 burden during HRV circulation and highlighting virus-virus interactions as epidemiologic modifiers [^112cBaDZ] [^1143Uyqd].

> Finally, I need to synthesize key research gaps and clinical takeaways. We need better point-of-care diagnostics to distinguish infection from carriage, robust antivirals targeting conserved replication steps or host pathways, and vaccine strategies that overcome type diversity; clinically, HRV is not "just a cold" but a major driver of morbidity across ages and comorbidities, and management should prioritize supportive care, judicious testing in high-risk contexts, and prevention through hygiene and vaccination against other respiratory viruses to reduce overall burden [^11784iaW] [^111EeZ4p] [^115oznB9].

Rhinovirus is the **most common cause of acute respiratory infections** [^11784iaW], especially the common cold, and is transmitted via respiratory droplets, aerosols, and contact with contaminated surfaces [^111879Ux]. It causes **mild, self-limited upper respiratory symptoms** [^111gbv9R] but can trigger severe lower respiratory disease in children, older adults, and those with asthma, COPD, or immunocompromise [^112VD8mh]. Diagnosis is clinical; **RT-PCR is the most sensitive test** [^115FEure] but is not routinely required. Management is supportive, with no approved antivirals or vaccines; prevention relies on hand hygiene and infection control [^115oznB9] [^111thJex].

### The seasonality of rhinovirus infections and its implications for clinical recognition [^114vUEb6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of acute respiratory infections. Isolation of rhinoviruses occurs in a distinct and consistent seasonal pattern that can be used to help determine whether an acute respiratory illness is caused by a rhinovirus.

Objective

This article reviews information on the seasonality of rhinovirus infection derived from early and recent studies of rhinovirus occurrence and treatment.

Methods

PubMed was searched from 1965 to the present to identify all potentially relevant papers. The search terms used were rhinovirus and seasonality. A total of 1998 papers were screened.

Results

Rhinoviruses comprise more than three quarters of viruses circulating in early autumn. In some years and perhaps some geographic areas, spring is an even more important time for rhinovirus transmission. Although overall rates of respiratory illness are lower in summer, rhinoviruses are the most frequently isolated virus at this time of year. Other viral agents, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (particularly with parainfluenza virus), predominate in the winter. Thus, for most of the year, rhinoviruses are the cause of the majority of acute viral respiratory infections.

Conclusion

Understanding the seasonal incidence of rhinovirus infection may help determine how best to employ currently available antirhinoviral agents in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute viral respiratory infection.

### Promising approaches for the treatment and prevention of viral respiratory illnesses [^111EeZ4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common human ailments, leading to enormous health and economic burden. Hundreds of viral species and subtypes have been associated with these conditions, with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses being the most frequent and with the highest burden. When considering prevention or treatment of viral respiratory tract infections, potential targets include the causative pathogens themselves but also the immune response, disease transmission, or even just the symptoms. Strategies targeting all these aspects are developing concurrently, and several novel and promising approaches are emerging. In this perspective we overview the entire range of options and highlight some of the most promising approaches, including new antiviral agents, symptomatic or immunomodulatory drugs, the re-emergence of natural remedies, and vaccines and public health policies toward prevention. Wide-scale prevention through immunization appears to be within reach for respiratory syncytial virus and promising for influenza virus, whereas additional effort is needed in regard to rhinovirus, as well as other respiratory tract viruses.

### Rhinovirus respiratory infections and asthma [^115FgdWb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral infections, particularly respiratory illnesses caused by rhinovirus, are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children and contribute in large part to asthma morbidity in adults. Epidemiologic studies and increasingly sophisticated viral detection methodologies have helped to define the role of rhinovirus as a potential causative agent in asthma exacerbations. Rhinovirus-induced lung disease is multifaceted and can be characterized in terms of a variety of physiologic, immunologic, and viral processes. The precise direct and indirect mechanisms of viral contribution to exacerbations must still be elucidated. Understanding them will have an impact on the design of future treatment modalities.

### Do rhinoviruses cause pneumonia in children? [^1126By1n]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Rhinoviruses are the most common precipitants of the common cold and have been associated with different infections of the respiratory tract, such as otitis media and sinusitis. They have also been implicated in the induction of acute asthma exacerbations, most of which are preceded by a common cold. Although in several occasions, mainly in immunocompromised hosts, severe lower respiratory tract infections have been attributed to rhinovirus infections, it is still unclear whether and to what extent these viruses contribute as pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia. Current mechanistic data suggest that rhinoviruses could be the cause of pneumonia in immunocompetent subjects. This notion is supported by epidemiological evidence, however, more clinical studies are needed to assess the actual burden.

### Epidemiology of viral respiratory infections [^114HARR5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common illnesses in all individuals, regardless of age or gender. Epidemiologic surveys and community-based studies conducted since the beginning of the 20th century have determined the rates of illness and the pathogens involved in such infections. These studies have shown that rhinoviruses cause the great majority of these respiratory illnesses, and their findings have examined the means of transmission of respiratory illness. More recently, advances in diagnostic techniques have enabled more complete identification of the viruses involved in respiratory infections, which has aided in the ability to direct specific therapeutic agents at the causative pathogens.

### Clinical significance and pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections [^115q3tXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections, also known as colds, are the most common infection in humans. The majority of these infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus deposition in the nose or the eye initiates infection. The virus attaches to the host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors in the back of the throat. Subsequent viral replication triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurogenic pathways, which lead to symptoms. Symptoms occur within 10 to 16 hours after virus entry into the nose and peak on days 2 to 3 of infection. Symptom duration is typically 1 week, although 25% of cases last longer. Understanding the chronology of these events is important in the timing of treatment. Because of the rapidity of symptom onset, early treatment is the key to reducing viral replication and illness. Also, early treatment may reduce the risk of transmission.

### The common cold [^11784iaW]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Despite great advances in medicine, the common cold continues to be a great burden on society in terms of human suffering and economic losses. Of the several viruses that cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is most prominent. About a quarter of all colds are still without proven cause, and the recent discovery of human metapneumovirus suggests that other viruses could remain undiscovered. Research into the inflammatory mechanisms of the common cold has elucidated the complexity of the virus-host relation. Increasing evidence is also available for the central role of viruses in predisposing to complications. New antivirals for the treatment of colds are being developed, but optimum use of these agents would require rapid detection of the specific virus causing the infection. Although vaccines against many respiratory viruses could also become available, the ultimate prevention of the common cold seems to remain a distant aim.

### Human rhinoviruses: the cold wars resume [^1138pWDa]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of viral illness worldwide but today, less than half the strains have been sequenced and only a handful examined structurally. This viral super-group, known for decades, has still to face the full force of a molecular biology onslaught. However, newly identified viruses (NIVs) including human metapneumovirus and bocavirus and emergent viruses including SARS-CoV have already been exhaustively scrutinized. The clinical impact of most respiratory NIVs is attributable to one or two major strains but there are 100+ distinct HRVs and, because we have never sought them independently, we must arbitrarily divide the literature's clinical impact findings among them. Early findings from infection studies and use of inefficient detection methods have shaped the way we think of 'common cold' viruses today.

Objectives

To review past HRV-related studies in order to put recent HRV discoveries into context.

Results

HRV infections result in undue antibiotic prescriptions, sizable healthcare-related expenditure and exacerbation of expiratory wheezing associated with hospital admission.

Conclusion

The finding of many divergent and previously unrecognized HRV strains has drawn attention and resources back to the most widespread and frequent infectious agent of humans; providing us the chance to seize the advantage in a decades-long cold war.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^1121VbmL]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Cough is a protective reflex to prevent aspiration and can be triggered by a multitude of stimuli. The commonest form of cough is caused by upper respiratory tract infection and has no benefit to the host. The virus hijacks this natural defence mechanism in order to propagate itself through the population. Despite the resolution of the majority of cold symptoms within 2 weeks, cough can persist for some time thereafter. Unfortunately, the mechanism of infectious cough brought on by pathogenic viruses, such as human rhinovirus, during colds, remains elusive despite the extensive work that has been undertaken. For socioeconomic reasons, it is imperative we identify the mechanism of cough. There are several theories which have been proposed as the causative mechanism of cough in rhinovirus infection, encompassing a range of different processes. Those of which hold most promise are physical disruption of the epithelial lining, excess mucus production and an inflammatory response to rhinovirus infection which may be excessive. And finally, neuronal modulation, the most convincing hypothesis, is thought to potentiate cough long after the original stimulus has been cleared. All these hypotheses will be briefly covered in the following sections.

### Rhinovirus and the developing lung [^114NZEUD]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are now widely accepted as the commonest cause of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in children. Advanced PCR techniques have enabled HRV infections to be identified as causative agents in most common ARIs in childhood including bronchiolitis, acute asthma, pneumonia and croup. However, the long-term implications of rhinovirus infections are less clear. The aim of this review is to examine the relationship between rhinovirus infections and disorders of the lower airways in childhood.

### How rhinovirus infections cause exacerbations of asthma [^117QucVX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus (RV) infections are closely linked to exacerbations of asthma, and yet most RV infections of patients with asthma cause only upper respiratory symptoms. These findings suggest that RV and other viral infections contribute to the causation of acute exacerbations of asthma, but that additional cofactors are generally required. In fact, factors related to the host, virus, and environment have been identified that affect the severity of RV infections, and propensity to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms. This review will discuss these factors and how their effects may act alone or in combination to increase the probability of RV-induced exacerbations of asthma.

### Human rhinoviruses [^11485gcs]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses are the most important causative agents of upper respiratory infections and are also implicated in more severe clinical entities. Although often present, very little is known about human rhinoviruses. Molecular methods have been used in the classification of this large group of viruses into two separate clades. In addition, one known serotype was found to be a member of enterovirus group D. Laboratory diagnosis of human rhinovirus infection is based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods or the more tedious virus culture but a rapid "bedside" method is unavailable. Anti-rhinoviral therapy has been under extensive study over the past few decades but symptomatic treatment of the common cold is still the only useful approach in clinical use. More data on circulating human rhinovirus strains would facilitate both detection and treatment of these common pathogens.

### Viral infections and chronic rhinosinusitis [^113w88iT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Viral infections are the most common cause of upper respiratory infections; they frequently infect adults once or twice and children 6 to 8 times annually. In most cases, these infections are self-limiting and resolve. However, many patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) relay that their initiating event began with an upper respiratory infection that progressed in both symptom severity and duration. Viruses bind to sinonasal epithelia through specific receptors, thereby entering cells and replicating within them. Viral infections stimulate interferon-mediated innate immune responses. Recent studies suggest that viral infections may also induce type 2 immune responses and stimulate the aberrant production of cytokines that can result in loss of barrier function, which is a hallmark in CRS. The main purpose of this review will be to highlight common viruses and their associated binding receptors and highlight pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with alterations in mucociliary clearance, epithelial barrier function, and dysfunctional immune responses that might lead to a further understanding of the pathogenesis of CRS.

### Rhinovirus infections and their roles in asthma: etiology and exacerbations [^115XggC2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinovirus infections can cause wheezing illnesses in all age groups. In preschool children, rhinovirus infections frequently initiate acute wheezing illnesses. Children who wheeze with rhinoviruses are at increased risk to go on to develop asthma. Once asthma is established, rhinovirus infections are potent triggers for acute airway obstruction and exacerbations in children and adults. Paradoxically, for most individuals, rhinovirus infections commonly cause cold symptoms with little or no involvement of the lower airways. This paradox has led investigators to identify specific risk factors and mechanisms for rhinovirus wheezing, and this review will outline progress in 3 main areas. First, the 3 species of rhinoviruses have different patterns of infection and virulence. Second, personal factors such as lung function and immunity influence lower respiratory outcomes of rhinovirus infection. The mucosal immune response is critical, and the quality of the interferon response and allergic inflammation interacts to determine the risk for rhinovirus wheezing. Finally, rhinovirus infections can promote pathogen-dominated airway microbiota that increase the risk for wheezing. Although specific antivirals for rhinovirus are still not available, identifying risk factors for wheezing illnesses has provided several other potential targets and strategies for reducing the risk of rhinovirus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma.

### How viral infections cause exacerbation of airway diseases [^11125u5z]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Over the last decade, studies using new molecular diagnostic techniques have established that respiratory viruses are a major cause of exacerbations of both asthma and COPD. The most prevalent viruses detected during exacerbations are the rhinoviruses. Despite the burden of disease associated with exacerbations, little is known about the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of airway diseases. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation in patients with both asthma and COPD, but many questions remain unanswered regarding the key inflammatory cells and mediators involved. Identifying the key inflammatory mediators involved in exacerbations holds the promise of developing diagnostic and prognostic markers of exacerbation. In addition, such studies can identify new therapeutic targets for the development of novel drugs for the prevention and treatment of exacerbations.

### Severe respiratory viral infections: new evidence and changing paradigms [^114xGXEM]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of death in the United States. Advances in diagnostic testing have improved our ability to detect pathogens. Viral pathogens are important causal pathogens in immunocompetent patients. As the number of elderly adults and those with chronic medical conditions increases, the burden of viral respiratory infections will increase. Clinicians must be familiar with the characteristics of rhinovirus, human adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Major challenges include distinguishing true infection from asymptomatic carriage and characterizing patients admitted with severe lower respiratory tract infection who do not have a causative pathogen identified.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^116HQMQC]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Human rhinoviruses (RVs) are the primary aetiological agent of the common cold. Generally, the associated infection is mild and self‐limiting, but may also be associated with bronchiolitis in infants, pneumonia in the immunocompromised and exacerbation in patients with pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Viral infection accounts for as many as two thirds of asthma exacerbations in children and more than half in adults. Allergy and asthma are major risk factors for more frequent and severe RV‐related illnesses. The prevalence of RV‐induced wheezing will likely continue to increase given that asthma affects a significant proportion of the population, with allergic asthma accounting for the majority. Several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered, with various degrees of relevance. This review will focus on RV infection in the context of the epidemiologic evidence, genetic variability, pathobiology, clinical studies in the context of asthma, differences with other viruses including COVID‐19 and current treatment interventions.

### Rhinovirus-not just the common cold [^115Mfkq4]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Rhinoviruses (RV) are ubiquitous respiratory tract pathogens. They affect both the upper and lower respiratory tract and cause colds but have also been associated with wheezing, asthma exacerbations and pneumonia. New blood transcription profiling techniques of the host immune response are becoming available to characterise the pathogenesis of RV in humans. This review will outline the clinical impact of RVs in children.

### Epidemiology and prevention of pediatric viral respiratory infections in health-care institutions [^1171kTQD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Nosocomial viral respiratory infections cause considerable illness and death on pediatric wards. Common causes of these infections include respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. Although primarily a community pathogen, rhinovirus also occasionally results in hospitalization and serious sequelae. This article reviews effective infection control interventions for these three pathogens, as well as ongoing controversies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rhinovirus respiratory infections [^112puGvh]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Acute upper viral respiratory infection (VRI) is the number one cause of illness for which patients seek medical care in the United States. Rhinoviruses, members of the family Picornaviridae, are the causative pathogens in more than half of VRIs, and they are associated with acute exacerbations of respiratory disease, including asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, and COPD. Owing to the lack of commercial availability of rapid and cost-effective laboratory tests to confirm the presence of VRI, the diagnosis is most commonly made empirically, based on patient history and physical examination. Currently, no antiviral agents that are active against picornaviruses are available for clinical use. Antimicrobial agents, frequently prescribed for VRIs, are not active against viruses, and their inappropriate and widespread use has contributed to an increase in antimicrobial resistance among bacteria commonly involved in respiratory tract infections. Several newer antiviral agents are being evaluated for treatment of VRIs. Although a variety of mechanisms and agents have been tested, few have shown significant clinical benefit in human trials. The most advanced antiviral agent in clinical trials is pleconaril, a novel viral capsid-binding inhibitor with potent and highly specific in vitro activity against the majority of serotypes of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Clinical trials of pleconaril for the treatment of VRIs have been conducted, and the role of pleconaril in patients with chronic lung disease is being evaluated.

### Rhinovirus infections in the upper airway [^115PYbx6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

The majority of cold and flulike illnesses are caused by human rhinoviruses (HRVs). Improved detection of HRV has shown that HRVs are also associated with more serious illness, such as exacerbation of asthma, wheezing illnesses in children, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiopulmonary disease, and fatal pneumonia in immune-compromised patients. HRV is a major cause of acute viral respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children and is among the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide. Detection of the HRV genome by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and genomic sequencing has brought to light a new clade, HRV-C, to the already recognized HRV-A and HRV-B clades. The clinical complications related to all rhinovirus infections include acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and acute bronchitis. The enormous public health implications from those diseases far overshadow those of the common cold. This article provides an overview of the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection in the upper airways. Most research has been done in young healthy adults with self-limiting experimental and natural rhinovirus infections, and this may set the stage for understanding rhinovirus infections in the ear, sinus, and lower airways.

### Newly identified human rhinoviruses: molecular methods heat up the cold viruses [^112QFUeo]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections cause at least 70% of virus-related wheezing exacerbations and cold and flu-like illnesses. They are associated with otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Annually, the economic impact of HRV infections costs billions in healthcare and lost productivity. Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of their approximately 7kb genomes was finalised in 2009. Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly-defined 'strains', perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species- or strain-specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid-binding antivirals? This update reviews the findings that trigger these and other questions arising during the current cycle of intense rhinovirus discovery.

By elevating HRV to a status comparable to that of other major viral pathogens, such as influenza, in research and public health priorities, we can better mobilise resources and direct efforts towards mitigating its substantial impact on public health. This comprehensive approach is essential for developing effective preventive and therapeutic measures that could lead to significant reductions in severe ARI cases associated with HRV.

### Human rhinovirus infection blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication within the respiratory epithelium: implications for COVID-19 epidemiology [^112cBaDZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Virus-virus interactions influence the epidemiology of respiratory infections. However, the impact of viruses causing upper respiratory infections on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and transmission is currently unknown. Human rhinoviruses cause the common cold and are the most prevalent respiratory viruses of humans. Interactions between rhinoviruses and cocirculating respiratory viruses have been shown to shape virus epidemiology at the individual host and population level. Here, we examined the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory epithelium in the presence or absence of rhinovirus. We show that human rhinovirus triggers an interferon response that blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mathematical simulations show that this virus-virus interaction is likely to have a population-wide effect as an increasing prevalence of rhinovirus will reduce the number of new coronavirus disease 2019 cases.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### A, B, and C rhinoviruses: new knowledge from an impressive consortium. A step forward for rhinovirus vaccine efforts or a step back? [^112zXDsu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rhinovirus (RV) infections cause asymptomatic infections, wheezing, and nonwheezing lower respiratory tract infections in young children and the majority of acute attacks of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and deaths. There are 157 numbered RVs, which are divided into A, B, and C species based on sequence homology. One hundred RV-As and RV-Bs have been serotyped, and most do not crossneutralize. Studies with RV-Cs have been prevented by difficulties growing these viruses, but given the sequence divergence between A/B and C strains, it is unlikely the 51 numbered C strains will crossneutralize. The need for > 150 strains in RV vaccines has hampered vaccine development. However, if certain RVs were more common causes of severe disease, could vaccine efforts be focused on these RVs to help move vaccine development forward?

RV-Bs are less likely to cause severe illness in children than RV-A or RV-C. However, data on RV-A/Cs and severe respiratory illnesses are not consistent, as studies in children have reported more RV-Cs than RV-As, whereas studies in adults reported more RV-As than RV-Cs.

In this issue of the Journal, Choi and colleagues (pp.) have made significant progress in understanding the importance of different RV species and strains in respiratory illnesses in children. They analyzed nasal and plasma samples from birth to age 18 in the COAST (Childhood Origins of ASThma) study, which studied 289 children from Madison, Wisconsin, at birth, 210 of whom were followed to age 18. They partially sequenced > 8,000 RV-positive samples from asymptomatic and illness visits to compare RV-A and RV-C frequencies at ages 0–3, 4–8, 9–13, and 14–18 and found that RV-A and RV-C were similarly common at ages 0–3, but thereafter, RV-A was approximately twice as common as RV-C (P < 0.001). The authors hypothesized that this change in frequency might result from differences in neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses with age, as nAbs protect against reinfection with RVs. nAbs to RV-C had not previously been analyzed because infection of permissive cells with RV-Cs in vitro does not result in visible cytopathic effect (CPE), so there was no suitable system to assay infectivity and its neutralization by observing CPE.

### Rhinovirus and asthma exacerbations [^114Q1P6A]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhinovirus (RV) is ubiquitous and typically causes only minor upper respiratory symptoms. However, especially in children and adolescent asthmatics, RV is responsible for most exacerbations. This ability of RV to drive exacerbations typically requires the concomitant presence of exposure to a bystander allergen. Susceptibility to RV-mediated exacerbations is also related to the genetic background of the host, which contributes to greater infectivity, more severe infections, altered immune responses, and to greater inflammation and loss of asthma control. Given these responses, there are several treatments available or being developed that should improve the control of exacerbations related to RV infection.

### Occurrence of respiratory virus: time, place and person [^117UQSeF]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory viruses account for most respiratory infections. Although analysis of epidemiologic information regarding viral seasonality, sites of transmission and susceptible populations is essential to devising strategies for limiting epidemics, few long term epidemiologic studies have addressed these questions.

Methods

Epidemiologic findings identifying susceptible populations, as well as temporal and geographic patterns of infection with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus were reviewed.

Conclusions

Influenza is the virus most frequently associated with outbreaks of respiratory infection resulting in medical consultation as well as virus-related lethality. Similar symptom profiles and overlapping seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses may sometimes complicate surveillance and treatment. Although vaccination and antiviral drugs are virus-specific, factors that promote transmission and thus strategies for limiting outbreaks are similar for various respiratory viruses.

### Respiratory viral infections and host responses; insights from genomics [^112RRYE5]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of disease and mortality. The severity of these illnesses can vary markedly from mild or asymptomatic upper airway infections to severe wheezing, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. In this article, we review the viral sensing pathways and organizing principles that govern the innate immune response to infection. Then, we reconstruct the molecular networks that differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic respiratory viral infections, and identify the underlying molecular drivers of these networks. Finally, we discuss unique aspects of the biology and pathogenesis of infections with respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and influenza, drawing on insights from genomics.

### Respiratory viral infections and host responses; insights from genomics [^1178XvA9]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory infections are the leading cause of disease globally. In young children, they are responsible for around one quarter of hospitalizations and up to 60% of visits to the general practitioner. In most cases, respiratory viral infections are self-limiting and confined to the upper airways, where they evoke relatively mild symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose. However, in susceptible individuals, such as newborns and the elderly, the symptoms can impact on the lower airways, resulting in wheeze, shortness of breath, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Common respiratory viral pathogens include adenovirus, enterovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus (RV), influenza, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Of these viruses, most genomic studies have focused on RSV, RV and influenza. This is because RSV is the most important cause of respiratory tract infections leading to hospitalization among infants. RV causes the majority of colds and around two thirds of asthma exacerbations. Influenza is the most common cause of pneumonia related deaths in developed countries. The mechanisms that determine why some individuals suffer from severe illness whilst others do not are not well understood. In this review we will focus primarily on the contribution of the host response, drawing on insights from genomics.

### Exacerbations: etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms [^111PyRKS]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Some patients with COPD are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are an important determinant of health status. Such patients have elevated airway cytokine levels, suggesting the presence of increased inflammation that may increase their susceptibility to exacerbation. The inflammatory response during a COPD exacerbation is variable, but increases in interleukin-6 levels during the exacerbation are related to the presence of a common cold. Rhinovirus infection is the most important etiologic factor in COPD exacerbations and is an important target for preventive therapy. The reduction of COPD exacerbations will have an important impact on the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.

### Rhinovirus associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections in children [^112u9dGp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus is a respiratory virus most typically associated with the common cold and asthma exacerbations, and has not traditionally been considered to play a major role in severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). As part of a surveillance program for respiratory pathogens of public health importance, children consecutively admitted to intensive care for LRTI at a large tertiary children's hospital were tested with polymerase chain reaction for 11 respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae from February 21 to October 31, 2007; 43 cases were enrolled and rhinovirus was the most frequently detected pathogen, with 21 (49%) positive. Rhinovirus cases frequently were young (median age, 1.4 years [range, 44 days-15 years]), hospitalized for pneumonia (10; 48%), had chronic underlying illnesses (15; 71%), had abnormal chest radiographs (18; 86%), required mechanical ventilation (12; 57%), and had prolonged hospitalization (median length, 7 days [range, 1–29 days]). Coinfection with other viruses or bacteria was common (10; 47%). Rhinovirus may be associated with more severe LRTI in children than previously reported, particularly in the noninfluenza, nonrespiratory syncytial virus season.

### Clinical effects of rhinovirus infections [^11549B2T]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus is the major cause of common cold and frequently associates with acute wheezing, otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. High prevalence of rhinovirus in hospitalized children and adults has been documented recently. We screened children ≥ 1 month of age, hospitalized for any infection, for the presence of rhinoviruses and recruited 24 families with ≥ 2 children for a 3-week follow-up study. Rhinovirus was detected in 46 (28%) of 163 hospitalizations by study children. Most rhinovirus-positive children (85%) had respiratory symptoms. During the follow-up, rhinoviruses were detected in virtually all children and in one-half of adults in families with a rhinovirus-positive index child, but commonly also in families with a rhinovirus-negative index child. Melting temperature and sequence analysis revealed the transmission routes of the viruses and showed that several virus types could circulate in the families simultaneously. Our studies corroborate the major contribution of rhinovirus to hospitalization of children, most often because of wheezing. Young children with respiratory symptoms are major spreaders of rhinovirus in family setting.

### Viral respiratory infection therapy: historical perspectives and current trials [^111XSQGi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Attempts to relieve the misery of the common cold have been made since long before current understanding of its viral origin. Although current symptomatic therapies provide some relief, any effective treatment must incorporate an antiviral to address the infection. Symptom production is related not only to viral cytopathic effect but also to the early activation of several inflammatory pathways. Antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. Combining an antiviral with selected therapeutic agents that block these inflammatory pathways has been shown to improve the effectiveness of cold treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment combined with regular dosing until symptoms subside appears to be the most effective treatment strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes. This strategy reduces viral shedding in nasal fluid, provides treatment for the period of maximum symptom burden, and may reduce the frequency and severity of the sinus disease that accompanies colds.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^115gzAF6]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The respiratory viruses that have been linked with asthma exacerbations include rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and coronavirus. It is relevant to distinguish the type of respiratory infection considering the ongoing concerns with the COVID‐19 virus pandemic. Common human coronaviruses — not to be confused with the novel coronavirus, or SARS‐CoV‐2, currently circulating — can cause mild to moderate upper‐respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. In fact, the majority of people will get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives; four common human coronaviruses cause 15%–30% of common colds.

Human RVs are small (27 nm), non‐enveloped, ssRNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family genus Enterovirus. The prevalence and spectrum of viral‐triggered exacerbations vary according to patient age and seasonality. Viral infection accounts for as many as 80% of exacerbations in childrenand more than 50% in adults. The prevalence of RV‐induced wheezing will likely continue to increase considering the prevalence of asthma, with an allergic component accounting for the majority of cases. It is important to emphasize that respiratory viruses act as triggers of wheezing. Despite improvements in asthma management and advances in therapeutics, the reported incidence of asthma exacerbations has not declined. Data from controlled clinical trials indicate that the development of asthma exacerbations in children as well as in adults are predictive of future exacerbations. Therefore, strategies enabling the management and control of viral‐induced events represent a priority to counter exacerbations linked to viral disease.

### Cost burden of viral respiratory infections: issues for formulary decision makers [^113fso53]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a common malady associated with considerable costs in terms of decreased productivity and time lost from work or school, visits to health-care providers, and the amount of drugs prescribed. Both total respiratory illness and rhinovirus infection peak during the fall and spring seasons, although the average percentage of office visits by patients with a rhinovirus infection is moderately high throughout the year. Most common cold remedies are relatively ineffective and may produce side effects that contribute to increased health-care costs. Antibiotic therapy is widely overused and misused despite evidence that antibiotics fail to treat the cause of VRI or prevent secondary bacterial infections. Increasing use of antibiotics has a significant impact on health-care costs and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Reasons for overprescribing antibiotics are varied, but they often involve physician and patient attitudes and expectations. Although treatment of VRIs poses challenges for effective formulary management, several steps can be taken to facilitate the introduction of antiviral agents, including patient and provider education, the development of rapid diagnostic tests, and medical-economics studies to determine the true cost of antiviral therapy.

### Rhinovirus disease in children seeking care in a tertiary pediatric emergency department [^113PWK1z]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinovirus is the most common cause of viral respiratory tract infections in children. Virologic predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), such as viral load and the presence of another respiratory virus (coinfection), are not well characterized in pediatric outpatients.

Methods

Mid-nasal turbinate samples were collected from children presenting for care to the Seattle Children's Hospital emergency department (ED) or urgent care with a symptomatic respiratory infection between December 2011 and May 2013. A subset of samples was tested for rhinovirus viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were collected by chart reviews. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between viral load and coinfection and the risk for LRTI.

Results

Rhinovirus was the most frequent respiratory virus detected in children younger than 3 years. Of 445 patients with rhinovirus infection, 262 (58.9%) had LRTIs, 231 (51.9%) required hospital admission and 52 (22.5%) were hospitalized for 3 days or longer. Children with no comorbidities accounted for 142 (54%) of 262 rhinovirus LRTIs. Higher viral load was significantly associated with LRTI among illness episodes with rhinovirus alone (OR, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–3.58). Coinfection increased the risk of LRTI (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.01–3.32).

Conclusions

Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen detected among symptomatic young children in a pediatric ED who had respiratory viral testing performed, with the majority requiring hospitalization. Higher rhinovirus viral load and coinfection increased disease severity. Virologic data may assist clinical decision making for children with rhinovirus infections in the pediatric ED.

### Host immune responses to rhinovirus: mechanisms in asthma [^115AhMzr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory infections can have a profound effect on many aspects of asthma including its inception, exacerbations, and, possibly, severity. Of the many viral respiratory infections that influence asthma, the common cold virus, rhinovirus, has emerged as the most frequent illness associated with exacerbations and other aspects of asthma. The mechanisms by which rhinovirus influences asthma are not fully established, but current evidence indicates that the immune response to this virus is critical in this process. Many airway cell types are involved in the immune response to rhinovirus, but most important are respiratory epithelial cells and possibly macrophages. Infection of epithelial cells generates a variety of proinflammatory mediators to attract inflammatory cells to the airway with a subsequent worsening of underlying disease. Furthermore, there is evidence that the epithelial airway antiviral response to rhinovirus may be defective in asthma. Therefore, understanding the immune response to rhinovirus is a key step in defining mechanisms of asthma, exacerbations, and, perhaps most importantly, improved treatment.

### Viral pneumonia [^116JyY9V]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

About 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year-100 million in children and 100 million in adults. Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated. In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries. Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia. Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia. No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics. Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures. Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more data from developing countries.

### Toward primary prevention of asthma. reviewing the evidence for early-life respiratory viral infections as modifiable risk factors to prevent childhood asthma [^111QkbXQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A first step in primary disease prevention is identifying common, modifiable risk factors that contribute to a significant proportion of disease development. Infant respiratory viral infection and childhood asthma are the most common acute and chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links between these diseases have long been recognized, with early-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) being strongly associated with increased asthma risk. However, there has long been debate over the role of these respiratory viruses in asthma inception. In this article, we systematically review the evidence linking early-life RSV and RV LRTIs with asthma inception and whether they could therefore be targets for primary prevention efforts.

### Rhinovirus transmission within families with children: incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections [^112SG4iu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of respiratory tract infections, but the transmission in families has not been studied using sensitive and specific molecular detection methods.

Methods

Children hospitalized for any infection were screened for rhinoviruses. Eight families with a rhinovirus-positive index child and 16 families with a rhinovirus-negative index child were monitored for 3 weeks for disease symptoms, and the presence and quantity of rhinoviruses in nasal swab samples were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Rhinoviruses were further identified by melting temperature and partial sequence analysis.

Results

The rates of rhinovirus infection were 1.00 cases per person among the 17 siblings and 0.50 cases per person among the 14 parents of rhinovirus-positive index patients; the rates were 0.54 cases per person among the 24 siblings and 0.23 cases per person among the 30 parents of rhinovirus-negative index patients. Symptomatic infections were associated with an age of < 7 years but not with a high copy number of rhinovirus genomes. Virus typing revealed the transmission routes of the viruses and showed that several virus types could circulate in the families simultaneously.

Conclusions

Rhinoviruses are frequently transmitted from children to other family members. Most rhinovirus infections in young children are symptomatic, but secondary infections in adults are often asymptomatic. Multiple virus types circulate simultaneously in families.

### The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics [^115pdBKe]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus (the "common" cold)

HRV infections, often considered trivial can significantly contribute to missed days from work and school, though infections are typically self-limiting. HRV infections throughout the year and in many cases, manifest with symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. HRV is known to be the primary cause of ARI and a severe contributing factor in exacerbations of atopic disease, e.g. asthma as well other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

HRV infections are associated with significant economic implications as well as being an important contributor to sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis and primary pneumonia. HRV is a considerable cause of morbidity in specific at-risk groups such as infants, the elderly, immunocompromised, and, as already mentioned, chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. At present, HRV is considered the number one cause of asthma exacerbations.

Asthma is a complex disease, characterised by chronic airway inflammation, and a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough. Over time these symptoms can vary in their intensity. Each year over 300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma: approximately 250,000 people die as a result. Many deaths are due to suboptimal long-term medical care and delay in obtaining help during severe exacerbations of the disease. Treatments to prevent worsening of symptoms and other therapies for mild to moderate asthma that avert relapse, i.e. the symptoms worsen again when the treatment stops, are significant unmet medical needs.

The human challenge model has been used to investigate the viral pathogenicity and recent publications on the asthma challenge model have focused on how the asthmatic host responds to HRV infection. Work is ongoing as to susceptibility to viral induced asthma worsening innate immune dysregulation and induction of innate, and type 2 responses in nasal and bronchial epithelial secretions.

### Rhinovirus infections in the first 2 years of life [^113DT8V1]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Rhinoviruses frequently cause respiratory infections in young children. We aimed to establish the burden of acute respiratory infections caused by rhinovirus during the first 2 years of life.

Methods

In this prospective birth cohort study, we followed 923 children for acute respiratory infections from birth to 2 years of age. Data on respiratory infections were collected by daily symptom diaries, study clinic visits, and from electronic registries. Respiratory viruses were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and antigen assays during respiratory infections and at the age of 2, 13, and 24 months. The rates of rhinovirus infections and associated morbidities were determined.

Results

We documented 8847 episodes of acute respiratory infections, with an annual rate of 5.9 per child (95% confidence interval, 5.7–6.1). Rhinovirus was detected in 59% of acute respiratory infections analyzed for viruses. Rhinovirus was associated with 50% of acute otitis media episodes, 41% of wheezing illnesses, 49% of antibiotic treatments, and 48% of outpatient office visits for acute respiratory infections. The estimated mean annual rate of rhinovirus infections was 3.5 per child (95% CI, 3.3–3.6), 47 per 100 children (95% CI, 42–52) for rhinovirus-associated acute otitis media, and 61 per 100 children (95% CI, 55–68) for rhinovirus-associated antibiotic treatment. The prevalence of rhinovirus at 2, 13, or 24 months of age was 14 to 24%, and 9% of asymptomatic children were positive for rhinovirus.

Conclusions

Rhinovirus infections impose a major burden of acute respiratory illness and antibiotic use on young children.

### Human rhinovirus types and association with respiratory symptoms during the first year of life [^116HtPpo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause respiratory infections and are associated with asthma development. We assessed HRV prevalence, types and association with respiratory symptoms in the first year of life in 20 unselected infants. HRV was detected in 32% of 825 weekly nasal swabs. Seventy-four different types of all three species were identified. HRV presence and related respiratory symptoms are highly heterogeneous.

### An experimental model of rhinovirus induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a pilot study [^1148DRNe]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report the first study to experimentally infect COPD patients with a respiratory virus. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of developing a human experimental model of virus-induced COPD exacerbation, and to provide preliminary evidence for a causative role for virus infection in exacerbations. We demonstrated that experimental rhinovirus inoculation of subjects with underlying COPD results in clinical colds, together with increased lower respiratory tract symptoms and falls in PEF.

These data provide preliminary evidence of safety for this experimental model and suggest that it is feasible to further develop the model in larger numbers of subjects. They also provide preliminary evidence for a causal role for virus infections in inducing exacerbations of COPD.

In order to develop new therapies for COPD exacerbations a detailed understanding of the causes of exacerbations, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms is needed. Since studying naturally occurring exacerbations is extremely difficult, development of an experimental model in which causation could be confirmed and in which detailed clinical studies on mechanisms of disease could be carried out, would be a major step forward. Experimental virus infection has been used extensively in both healthy volunteers and asthmatics to study the pathogenesis of the common cold and virus-induced asthma exacerbations, as well as to identify and evaluate potential new treatments for these conditions. Respiratory virus infections are associated with between 40% and 65% of COPD exacerbations, and rhinoviruses are the most common virus type detected. However the safety of experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients has never been evaluated.

### Common childhood viral infections [^112Jggxo]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2015). Low credibility.

Infections caused by viruses are universal during childhood and adolescence. Clinicians will regularly care for children and adolescents who present with infections caused by a wide number of viral pathogens. These infections have varied presentations. Many infections may have clinical presentations that are specific to the infecting virus but present differently, based on the age and immunocompetence of the patient. Some children are directly impacted early in their lives when maternal disease results in an in utero infection (cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, or parvovirus B19). Other viruses may infect children in a predictable pattern as they grow older (rhinovirus or influenza virus). Fortunately, many viral infections frequently encountered in the past are no longer extant due to widespread immunization efforts. Recognition of these vaccine-preventable infections is important because outbreaks of some of these diseases (mumps or measles) continue to occur in the United States. Vigilance in vaccine programs against these viral agents can prevent their re-emergence. In addition, an increasing number of viral infections (herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, varicella zoster virus, or cytomegalovirus) can now be successfully treated with antiviral medications. Most viral infections in children result in self-limited illness and are treated symptomatically and infected children experience full recovery. This review will address the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of viral infections commonly encountered by the clinician.

### Overview of virus-induced airway disease [^1172Lzr6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health costs of both diseases. Currently available treatments are poorly effective in both acute treatment of and prevention of acute exacerbations. New treatments for intervention and prophylaxis are therefore required; to facilitate their development, we must understand the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations. Respiratory viral infections (2/3 rhinoviruses) precipitate 80% or more of asthma exacerbations in children, and the majority of exacerbations of asthma and COPD in adults, but mechanisms of virus-induced lower airway inflammation and of host resistance against respiratory viruses are poorly understood. Development of in vitro experimental models of virus infection has identified interferon-beta and nitric oxide as possible therapeutic targets to augment antiviral immunity, and nuclear factor-kappaB as a target for development of anti-inflammatory therapies. In vivo models could also serve to identify and validate targets and as an experimental system to test candidate molecules as they emerge into clinical studies. Studies in asthma have paved the way for development of an asthma model; a similar experimental model in COPD would accelerate development of new therapies for these common diseases with enormous burdens of illness.

### Antiviral chemotherapeutic agents against respiratory viruses: where are we now and what's in the pipeline? [^1152CmZd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in late 2002 and the recent outbreaks of avian influenza in Asia are timely reminders of the ever present risks from respiratory viral diseases. Apart from influenza, there are no vaccines and very few antiviral chemotherapeutic agents available for the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections-the most common cause of human illness. If the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreak ever assumes the role of a pandemic, formidable technical difficulties relating to the properties of the agent, itself, will ensure that vaccines will only become available after a significant lead time and then only to a relatively small percentage of the population. The use of existing antivirals could be critical in limiting the initial spread of a pandemic, although their use in the control of epidemics caused by nonpandemic viruses has not been evaluated. It is against this background that a review of recent developments in respiratory antivirals has been undertaken.

Recent Findings

The late 1990s were a period of unprecedented activity in the development of new and much superior antivirals for the treatment of influenza infections. However, during the past 2 to 3 years and largely for commercial reasons, there has been a decline in interest in their further development by major drug companies. This situation may soon change with the possible advent of new pandemic viruses, and moves are afoot in several countries to consider the stockpiling of antivirals. The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, remain the only options for controlling respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses, although the latter two could not be used against very recent H5N1 strains. There are several other neuraminidase inhibitors in development. Compounds with activity against other respiratory viruses, notably rhinoviruses, are also in development, many based on a newer knowledge of viral protein structure and function (rational drug design).

Summary

The following is an overview of recent papers on the further development of neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza viruses and on recent development of newer antivirals against RSV and rhinoviruses. Where possible, comparisons are made with existing antivirals. For considerations of space, this review has been structured around stages in the replication cycle of significant respiratory viruses that have been traditionally used as targets for inhibition.

### An intensive, active surveillance reveals continuous invasion and high diversity of rhinovirus in households [^111879Ux]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are frequently detected in both children and adults with acute respiratory infections, common colds, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, acute otitis media, and acute wheezing. Although usually mild and self-limiting, HRV infections may exacerbate asthma or other preexisting respiratory illnesses, and are sometimes associated with hospitalization with lower respiratory tract infection. In sub-Saharan Africa, HRV prevalence in children < 5 years presenting to health care facilities with acute respiratory infections has ranged from 10% to 41%. Asymptomatic infections are common and readily detected.

HRV is a nonenveloped, single stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of approximately 7200 nucleotides encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved into 11 proteins. Over 160 types, classified into 3 species (A, B, and C) based on VP1 and VP4/VP2 genes, exist. Rhinovirus A and B types were originally determined by neutralization assays using monospecific antisera and by their specific cellular receptor, indicating phenotypic differences between types. Serological assays for routine diagnosis have largely been replaced by molecular methods targeting the 5′ untranslated region gene, which permit virus load quantification and have previously been used to describe HRV transmission within households and child care centers.

HRV is spread by aerosolized droplets or surfaces contaminated with infected respiratory tract secretions, including direct human-to-human contact. To date, no HRV vaccines are available due to antigenic heterogeneity amongst all known strains, lack of data identifying the most commonly circulating strains, or species- or type-specific virulence, and the incomplete understanding of antigenic differences between HRV species. In addition, vaccine development is hindered by lack of estimates of disease burden, and the common assumption that the infections are mild and self-limiting. Nonetheless, HRV is now recognized to lead to more severe disease with relevant impact on patient quality of life and health care-related costs.

Transmission is common within families, day care centers and schools, with studies showing several HRV types circulating in a community at the same time. Household and community-based studies provide a natural setting to track infections because of the high frequency of contacts and are a key source of information on viral transmission dynamics. These studies provide estimates of per-infection risk of disease, important insights into epidemiology of respiratory infections, and crucial information for design of public health interventions, for instance, immunization or antiviral prophylaxis. There are no comparative household studies from Africa.

### The role of rhinovirus in asthma exacerbations [^116wb6Gx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Rhinoviruses are a major cause of asthma exacerbations in children and adults. With the use of sensitive RT-PCR methods, respiratory viruses are found in approximately 80% of wheezing episodes in children and in approximately one half of such episodes in adults. Rhinovirus is a member of the family Picornaviridae, and acute rhinovirus infections occur predominantly in the upper airway. This virus has also been identified in the lower airway, and it might cause acute wheezing through the production of proinflammatory mediators with a resulting neutrophilic inflammatory response. Precisely how this process leads to increases in airway hyperresponsiveness and airway obstruction is not fully established. However, risk factors for wheezing with colds include asthma and atopy, extremes in age, and perhaps having a deficient TH1 response to rhinovirus. With the use of in vitro models and experimental inoculation studies, significant advances have led to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which rhinovirus infections cause asthma exacerbations. Advances in our understanding of this interaction might provide knowledge that could ultimately lead to specific treatment modalities to prevent and/or treat this significant burden of asthma exacerbations.

### The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics [^11763PmG]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) manifest as Upper (URI) or Lower (LRI) respiratory tract infections and may move between the two compartments; ARIs represent the most common infectious diseases and are predominantly of viral aetiology. The global burden of ARI is substantial with significant morbidity and mortality occurring in children, the elderly and immunocompromised.

In the UK alone during the period 2014–2015, respiratory disease caused an estimated 15,800 excess winter deaths. In the United States, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause substantial mortality especially among people aged 65 and older.

However, although deaths in the industrialised world are widely reported, developing countries feel the burden particularly; out of an estimated 1.9 million child deaths from ARIs in 2000, 70% of those deaths occurred in Africa and south-east Asia. The Millennium Summit at the United Nations in 2000 led to the setting up of the Millennium Development Goals.

A study reported the progress made in meeting those goals in 40 developing countries; it concluded that the prevalence of ARI was 13%, health expenditure and per capita gross domestic product is directly associated with the prevalence of the disease.

Viral heterogeneity associated with ARIs is well established. In the past, human rhinovirus (HRV) has been identified as the virus most frequently associated with respiratory illness with 30–50% of infections annually on average, and up to 80% of upper respiratory infections during the autumn outbreaks. After HRVs, coronaviruses (CoV), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the next most frequent.

More recently an evaluation of illness in 6,266 children under ten years of age in Australia, South East Asia and Latin America emphasised both the viral heterogeneity and the impact of ARI. Of the 2,421 children who experienced 3,717 individual influenza-like Illness (ILI) episodes, rhinovirus/enterovirus was most prevalent (41.5%). Influenza followed this (15.8%), adenovirus (ADV) (9.8%), PIV and RSV (both 9.7%), CoV (5.6%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.5%) and human bocavirus (HBoV) (2.0%). The percentage of children missing school or childcare was between 21.4% for HBoV and 52.1% for influenza.

### Rhinovirus C targets ciliated airway epithelial cells [^112VD8mh]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-influenza viral respiratory illnesses cost the US an estimated $39.5 billion annually from both healthcare costs and loss of productivity. Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common cause of viral upper respiratory illness resulting in rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, or otitis media, and can lead to the development of bacterial superinfections. While most individuals only experience mild symptoms during a RV infection, children, the elderly, the immunosuppressed, and those with asthma, COPD, or cystic fibrosis are predisposed to lower respiratory tract illnesses including wheezing, asthma exacerbations, and respiratory distress that can often result in hospitalization. RV has also been implicated in the initiation of asthma, as the presence of wheeze during acute RV infection in the first few years of life is strongly correlated with the development of asthma later in life. Three RV species (A, B and C) have been identified, and recent studies have established a link between RV species and illness severity. The RV-C, discovered in 2006, appear to instigate more severe upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms in infants and children under 5 years of age. In an effort to explain this phenomenon, Nakagome et al. inoculated airway epithelial cells with multiple members of each RV species, and observed the highest levels of viral replication, cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory cytokines following inoculation with either RV-A or C.

### Rhinovirus infections in infants suggest that early detection can prevent unnecessary treatment [^115rpquw]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Human rhinoviruses (hRV) are small, RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family, which are divided into three subtypes (A, B, C). hRVs are among the most common causes for acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) involving both the upper and lower respiratory tract.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess the magnitude and characteristics of hRV infections in hospitalized children, aged less than 5 years, hospitalized in Israel during 2011–2012.

Study Design

The 2503 respiratory samples were subjected to real-time PCR, to detect hRV and other respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus-positive samples were further tested by sequencing to identify the infecting species.

Results

Of these 2503 respiratory samples, 422 tested positive for hRV, of them, 243 were from children under 5 years of age (58% of all rhinoviral-positive samples). We also found that among the ARI-associated hospital admissions, 16% were positive for rhinovirus. hRV type A was the most common species. Laboratory data showed monocytosis in 51%, hypercalcemia in 61% and lower respiratory tract involvement in 75% of patients.

Conclusions

We thus recommend including rhinovirus testing as part of the routine testing performed in young children presenting with ARI.

### Rhinovirus C is associated with severe wheezing and febrile respiratory illness in young children [^113KkKJY]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhinovirus is the most common virus causing respiratory tract illnesses in children. Rhinoviruses are classified into species A, B and C. We examined the associations between different rhinovirus species and respiratory illness severity.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational cohort study on confirmed rhinovirus infections in 134 children 3–23 months of age, who were enrolled in 2 prospective studies on bronchiolitis and acute otitis media, respectively, conducted simultaneously in Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, between September 2007 and December 2008.

Results

Rhinovirus C is the most prevalent species in our study, and it was associated with severe wheezing and febrile illness. We also noted that history of atopic eczema was associated with wheezing.

Conclusions

Our understanding of rhinovirus C as the most pathogenic rhinovirus species was fortified. Existing research supports the idea that atopic characteristics are associated with the severity of the rhinovirus C-induced illness.

### PreDicta chip-based high resolution diagnosis of rhinovirus-induced wheeze [^114Dp2ZP]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory viral infections are among the most common triggers of acute exacerbations of pre-school wheeze, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) –. Asthma and COPD are severe and disabling diseases of the respiratory tract and hence represent a serious global health problem affecting different age groups. Acute pre-school wheeze and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are other common causes of emergency visits with possible viral etiology. There is an increasing prevalence of these airways diseases, rising treatment costs, and therefore virus-induced respiratory illnesses are a heavy burden for patients and the community. Respiratory viral infections, mainly due to rhinovirus (RV), are responsible for approximately 80% of wheeze and asthma exacerbations in children. Moreover, infants with rhinovirus-induced wheeze have a significantly increased risk for subsequent development of recurrent wheeze and childhood asthma. Since exposure to RV does not lead to wheezing illness in all children, additional factors such as the host genotype, defects of the respiratory epithelial barrier, and/or atopic predisposition have been suggested to play important roles in asthma –.

### Role of viruses in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zXqj6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and hospital admission. Respiratory viral infections, especially rhinoviruses, are a major cause of COPD exacerbations, with upper respiratory tract infections being associated with over 50% of COPD exacerbations. The presence of an upper respiratory tract infection leads to a more severe exacerbation and a longer symptom recovery time at exacerbation. Respiratory viral infections occurring during COPD exacerbations are more likely to lead to hospitalization. Sputum inflammatory markers were found to be higher in those patients with symptoms of a common cold or where rhinovirus was detected at exacerbation, thus suggesting that viral infections lead to greater airway inflammation and thus more severe exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are associated also with systemic inflammatory effects with increases in markers such as plasma fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Respiratory viruses have also been detected when the patients are stable, and this suggests that chronic viral infection may occur. Strategies to prevent viral infection will have a significant effect on the morbidity of COPD and will improve quality of life.

### Rhinovirus and asthma: challenges and opportunities [^114kJAX3]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

6 CLINICAL STUDIES

Most RV infections cause common cold symptoms with damage to the epithelial barrier integrity, causing an increased translocation of pathogens and complications of respiratory diseases. Up to 35% of asymptomatic subjects may test positive for RV, but the virus does not cause chronic infection or colonization in healthy subjects. However, both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection can induce systemic immune responses in young wheezing children. The Childhood Origins of Asthma study demonstrated that the risk for development of asthma by age 6 years was increased if children had wheezing with RV (odds ratio [OR], 9.8; 95% CI, 4.3, 22.0) during the first 3 years of life. Notably, 88% of children with RV‐induced wheezing in the third year of life had asthma by age 6 years. Although RV‐induced wheezing was an independent asthma risk factor, allergen sensitization significantly increases the RV‐associated risk of asthma.

### Prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with respiratory tract infections during the COVID-19 pandemic era: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cTb5i]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

The evaluation of the spread of respiratory viruses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is required to understand how SARS-CoV-2 may have impacted the spectrum of respiratory viruses among children. Our study aimed to examine the viral etiology of respiratory infections other than SARS-CoV-2 in children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

Three databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched from 2020 to 2023 to assess the pooled prevalence of respiratory viruses in different regions, types of patient care, and types of respiratory disease.

Results

A total of 68 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (29.1%) and Respiratory syncytial virus (11.3%) were among the most common viruses among children with respiratory infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients younger than 5 years old, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (36.2%) were the most prevalent viruses among all types of respiratory diseases. Also, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus were the most common viruses in the case of acute respiratory infection (26.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (21.0%), pneumonia (97.3%), and severe acute respiratory infection (54.7%). The most common viruses detected among inpatient cases were Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (47.4%) and Respiratory syncytial virus (14.9%). The prevalence of Influenza A + B viruses and Metapneumovirus among inpatients was also significantly higher than among outpatients.

Conclusion

The high prevalence of viruses such as Rhinovirus/Enterovirus and Respiratory syncytial virus in various respiratory conditions, shows the requirement for enhanced surveillance, vaccination, and treatment strategies. The significance of Influenza viruses and metapneumovirus in inpatient settings delineates the importance of prioritizing them in future preventive measures such as vaccine development to minimize respiratory infection-associated hospitalization.

### Why is temperature sensitivity important for the success of common respiratory viruses? [^113XB2Su]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 AT WHAT RANGE OF TEMPERATURES ARE COMMON RESPIRATORY VIRUSES SENSITIVE?

Right from the discovery of respiratory viruses, temperature has been known to have a major influence on the replication of respiratory viruses. The first cell cultures for an unknown virus which was later to be described as a rhinovirus were made unsuccessfully at 36°C and it was only when the temperature was reduced to 32°C that the viruses replicated well, and the investigators speculated that the cooler conditions for culture were like those at the surface of the nasal mucosa. The first cultures of a novel virus later to be described as a coronavirus were also made at the cooler temperature of 33°C rather than closer to human body temperature of 37 o C.

The common respiratory viruses include adenovirus, enterovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus (RV), influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). All these common respiratory viruses replicate best at a temperature close to that of the human upper airway which is between 32°C and 34 o C. The term "respiratory viruses" is not an exact term as viruses are opportunist and may infect any tissue and organ in the host that allows virus entry. In this review, the term "respiratory viruses", will mean viruses that predominantly enter and exit the host via the airway.

Table 1 illustrates the temperatures at which a range of common respiratory viruses were cultured. One of the first demonstrations of temperature sensitivity in a respiratory virus was made by Tyrrell and Parsons in 1960 when attempting to culture a virus responsible for causing a common cold syndrome of disease, and this virus was later named as a rhinovirus. The early experiments at culturing rhinoviruses discovered that the virus replicated better at 33°C than 37°C but as more and more rhinoviruses were discovered it was found that some of the 100 or so serotypes replicated well at 37°C and this may explain why some rhinovirus infect the lower airways and cause exacerbations of asthma.

TABLE 1
Temperatures at which a range of common respiratory viruses were cultured

Since the discovery of the temperature sensitivity of rhinoviruses other respiratory viruses have also been found to be temperature sensitive and this temperature sensitivity is a characteristic of the most common respiratory viruses such as corona viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirusand some enteroviruses that infect the respiratory tract.

### Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers [^112K3dBg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus is the main cause of the common cold, which remains the most frequent infection worldwide among humans. Knowledge and understanding of the rhinovirus transmission route is important to reduce morbidity as only preventive measures are effective. In this study, we investigated the potential of rhinovirus to survive on fingers. Rhinovirus-B14 was deposited on fingers for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Survival was defined as the ability of the virus to grow after 7 days, confirmed by immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus survival was not dependent on incubation time on fingers. Droplet disruption had no influence on survival. Survival was frequent with high rhinovirus concentrations, but rare with low-concentration droplets, which corresponded to the usual rhinovirus concentrations in mucus observed in children and adults, respectively. Our study confirms that rhinovirus infectiousness is related to the viral concentration in droplets and suggests that children represent the main transmission source, which occurs only rarely via adults. It confirms also that rhinovirus hand-related transmission is possible and supports hand hygiene as a key prevention measure.

### Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic characteristics of human rhinovirus infection among otherwise healthy children and adults: rhinovirus among adults and children [^112brNuh]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

human rhinovirus (HRV) is a major cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) in adults and children. Differences in disease severity by HRV species have been described among hospitalized patients with underlying illness. Less is known about the clinical and virologic characteristics of HRV infection among otherwise healthy populations, particularly adults.

Objectives

to characterize molecular epidemiology of HRV and association between HRV species and clinical presentation and viral shedding.

Study Design

observational, prospective, facility-based study of ILI was conducted from February 2010 to April 2012. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens, patient symptoms, and clinical information occurred on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Patients recorded symptom severity daily for the first 7 days of illness in a symptom diary. HRV was identified by RT-PCR and genotyped for species determination. Cases who were co-infected with other viral respiratory pathogens were excluded from the analysis. We evaluated the associations between HRV species, clinical severity, and patterns of viral shedding.

Results

eighty-four HRV cases were identified and their isolates genotyped. Of these, 62 (74%) were > 18 years. Fifty-four were HRV-A, 11HRV-B, and 19HRV-C. HRV-C infection was more common among children than adults (59% vs. 10%, P < 0.001). Among adults, HRV-A was associated with higher severity of upper respiratory symptoms compared to HRV-B (P = 0.02), but no such association was found in children. In addition, adults shed HRV-A significantly longer than HRV-C (P trend = 0.01).

Conclusions

among otherwise healthy adults with HRV infection, we observed species-specific differences in respiratory symptom severity and duration of viral shedding.

### Reduced rhinovirus-specific antibodies are associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring hospitalisation [^112xctW9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality and health care costs associated with COPD. Exacerbations are associated with poor clinical outcomes including accelerated decline of lung function, reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death. Despite the clinical importance of exacerbations, it is not entirely clear why some COPD patients experience frequent exacerbations, while others remain relatively stable. Though exacerbations tend to become more frequent in those with poor lung function, it has recently been shown that the single best predictor of exacerbations is a history of previous exacerbations. Susceptibility to exacerbations is also associated with bacterial colonisation of the airways during periods of clinical stability, with the presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux and with an elevated white blood cell count.

Many COPD exacerbations are triggered by respiratory infections with bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently cultured from sputum. In addition, the development of sensitive molecular detection methods has led to an increasing appreciation of the importance of respiratory viruses as triggers of exacerbations; human rhinoviruses are the most common viruses identified in this situation.

### Comparing respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in development of post-viral airway disease [^116nQJ2B]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) are common viral infections that may result in post-viral airway/atopic disease. By understanding the antiviral immune response involved, and the mechanisms that translate/associate with post-viral airway disease, further research can be directed to potential treatments that affect these mechanisms.

Data Sources

Utilized peer-reviewed manuscripts listed in PubMed that had relevance to RSV/RV and development of atopic/airway disease in both humans and mice.

Study Selections

Studies that explained the mechanisms behind antiviral response were selected.

Results

RSV infections have been associated with post-viral airway disease primarily in those without preexisting atopy; however, the mechanistic link connecting the viral infection with atopy is less clear. Mouse models (in particular those using Sendai virus, a virus related to RSV) provide a potential mechanistic pathway that may explain the linkage between RSV and post-viral airway disease. RV infection also can drive post-viral airway disease, but unlike RSV, this seems to occur only in those with preexisting atopy. Studies explore this link by demonstrating an impaired interferon response in atopic individuals, which may make them more susceptible to development of post-viral airway disease with RV infection.

Conclusion

Both RSV and RV are associated with a risk for developing post-viral airway disease and atopy. However, the mechanisms that connect these viruses with post-viral disease appear to be disparate, suggesting that treatments to prevent post-viral airway disease may need to be specific to the viral etiology.

### Etiology of infectious diseases in acutely ill children at a pediatric hospital in Finland [^114i7GWQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study demonstrated that rhinovirus was the most common etiology of infectious diseases in acutely ill children at a pediatric referral ED (23%) and in intensive care (48%). Population-based incidence of rhinovirus-related ED visits was high. In adults, rhinovirus has been reported to be an important pathogen in intensive care. In children, rhinovirus has been reported to cause the majority of asthma exacerbations and wheezing episodes. The most common bacterial etiology of acute infectious diseases was E. coli (5%), which is consistent with previous studies showing a high occurrence of febrile urinary tract infections in infants and young children.

In the present study, the possible or probable etiology of infections was detected in most of the acutely ill children at a referral clinic. Respiratory viruses caused more than 60% of infections with confirmed etiology. During the study period, the occurrence of respiratory syncytial virus was low. Based on the Finnish registry data, the number of respiratory syncytial virus infections might be 2- to 3-fold greater in epidemic years. The occurrence of influenza was not lower than average. Notably, this study was conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

In this study, rhinovirus was associated with severe morbidity and intensive care treatment in children. The main limitation of the present study was that the detection of a prevalent respiratory pathogen, such as rhinovirus, by molecular methods does not directly confirm causality between respiratory symptoms and the pathogen. Thus, because of the observational study design, not all the respiratory findings can be interpreted as the confirmed cause of the infection.

Based on the present study, the effective prevention and treatment of rhinovirus infections, other respiratory viral infections and E. coli infections would markedly reduce the burden of pediatric ED visits and hospitalizations in a high-income country with a comprehensive immunization program.

Viral infections, especially those caused by rhinovirus, are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations. Previous studies have argued that impaired innate antiviral immunity and, as a consequence, more severe infections contribute to these exacerbations.

Objective

These studies explored the innate immune response in the upper airway of volunteers with allergic rhinitis and asthma in comparison to healthy controls and interrogated how these differences corresponded to severity of infection.

Methods

Volunteers with allergic rhinitis, those with asthma, and those who are healthy were inoculated with rhinovirus A16 and monitored for clinical symptoms. Tissue and nasal wash samples were evaluated for antiviral signature and viral load.

Results

Both subjects with allergic rhinitis and asthma were found to have more severe cold symptoms. Subjects with asthma had worsened asthma control and increased bronchial hyperreactivity in the setting of higher fractional exhaled breath nitric oxide and blood eosinophils. These studies confirmed reduced expression of interferons and virus-specific pattern recognition receptors in both cohorts with atopy. Nevertheless, despite this defect in innate immunity, volunteers with allergic rhinitis/asthma had reduced rhinovirus concentrations in comparison to the controls.

Conclusion

These results confirm that the presence of an allergic inflammatory disorder of the airway is associated with reduced innate immune responsive to rhinovirus infection. Despite this, these volunteers with allergy have reduced viral loads, arguing for the presence of a compensatory mechanism to clear the infection.

### New respiratory enterovirus and recombinant rhinoviruses among circulating picornaviruses [^117B979y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are leading causes of respiratory infections. To evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution, we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus-specific or generic real-time PCR assays. We then sequenced the 5 untranslated region, capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of virus-positive samples. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis identified the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans. We identified and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media, confirming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens. Finally, we identified recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites, thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host. This study clarifies the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses.

Vaccine Challenges

Efforts to develop effective HRV vaccines have been ongoing since the 1960s, when it was established that deliberate inoculation could induce protective antibodies against specific HRV strains. Subsequent studies demonstrated that intramuscular administration of inactivated HRV could lead to the production of antibodies capable of protecting against subsequent illness.

However, developing vaccines with prolonged and broad immunity has proven challenging owing to the vast number of co-circulating HRV types and their associated antigenic diversity. Promisingly, a polyvalent vaccine targeting 50 HRV strains has been developed and tested in macaques. Practical strategies include regular surveillance of HRV in acutely ill populations and focusing vaccine efforts on the most prevalent and pathogenic HRV types. Additionally, vaccines that target common epitopes shared among HRV strains to induce cross-strain immune responses are in development. These vaccines could mitigate the challenges posed by the antigenic diversity of HRVs. Vaccines are particularly crucial for at-risk groups, such as patients with COPD, with the aim of reducing the frequency of virus-induced exacerbations.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^115oznB9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

There is no specific treatment for the common cold. Treatment is focused on easing the symptoms. Prevention is therefore essential to stop the spread of viruses that cause the common cold. In terms of preventive measures, studies have shown that simple measures such as handwashing and maintaining physical distance are relevant to all respiratory infections, but difficult to apply or enforce because, as time passes, motivation and compliance may decrease (Allan 2014; Jefferson 2020). Consequently, another method of prevention is vaccination. The development of vaccines for the common cold has been challenging because of the aetiological diversity of the disease and the antigenic variability of the common cold viruses (Glanville 2013; To 2017). The case of HRV remains a challenge for the public health and scientific communities due to technical, logistical, and fundamental biological difficulties (Stobart 2017). Unlike several human viruses, HRV vaccine must be able to elicit protective neutralising antibodies to potentially over 150 serologically distinct types spanning three different species (Ren 2017; Stobart 2017). For this reason, it is difficult to develop a vaccine that provides full protection (Stepanova 2019). Despite these challenges, recent attempts using rhinovirus‐derived VP1, a surface protein that is critically involved in the infection of respiratory cells, has demonstrated that with enough exposure and recombinant VP1 as an immunogen, cross‐serotype reactive antibodies can be generated (Edlmayr 2011; McLean 2012). The future of vaccine development for the common cold seems promising, considering that studies on virus genotyping such as HRV genotype are being published more frequently (Luka 2020; Ren 2017), and there is a rapid technological development of vaccines that include micro‐/nanoparticle material and recombinant technologies (Papadopoulos 2017).

### Role of rhinovirus in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract infections in Spain [^1131Jyn9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold, proven to cause asthma exacerbations in children. In Spain, no description exists, as yet, as to the degree of burden rhinovirus infections represent among hospitalized infants. Our aim was to describe rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children, under 2 years of age, and to compare these with patients infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Patients and Methods

The prospective study was performed between September 2003 and July 2005, in children < 2 years of age, admitted at the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganés, Madrid) with fever or respiratory tract infection and with positive rhinovirus detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Virologic diagnosis was made by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and for some virus by direct immunofluorescent assay in nasopharyngeal samples. Demographic and clinical data of those patients with rhinovirus infection were described and compared with a group of 86 patients, infected only with RSV, randomly selected from the same population.

Results

We detected 85 children admitted to hospital with rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus was the cause of 25% of all admissions, among the total of 340 under 2-year olds diagnosed with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second viral agent identified, after RSV. Clinical diagnosis was recurrent wheezing in 48.2%; bronchiolitis in 36.5%; and pneumonia in 3.5%. Fever was present in 60% of the patients. Radiologic infiltrates were found in 22.4% of the children. In 50.6% of the infants, oxygen saturation under 95% was detected, at the time of admission. Hypoxia was present in RSV-infected children more frequently (P = 0.005). Also, in this group, final diagnosis was, most frequently, bronchiolitis (P = 0.0001), and rhinovirus-infected patients were most frequently males (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Rhinovirus was detected in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract disease and was the second most common virus after RSV. In our experience, it was the second etiologic agent associated with recurrent wheezing in hospitalized children, under the age of 2 years.

### Lethal respiratory disease associated with human rhinovirus C in wild chimpanzees, Uganda, 2013 [^113b7u9X]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Rhinovirus C is unusual among rhinoviruses because of its clinical severity, unique biochemistry of receptor attachment, and role in modern human evolution. The analyses we present show that rhinovirus C is also distinguished by its ability to cross primate species barriers and cause severe disease. Although experiments conducted in the 1960s showed rhinoviruses A and B to be capable of infecting chimpanzees in captivity, infections were mild and self-limiting. Among other enteroviruses, only poliovirus has been implicated as a cause of death in wild chimpanzees. By showing that rhinovirus C is highly pathogenic in wild chimpanzees, our findings expand the known host range and clinical consequences of one of the most common causes of human respiratory disease.

Variant RV-C45-cpz1–2013 occupies an unremarkable phylogenetic position among rhinovirus C genomic variants from humans around the world (Figure 3). Although this virus is a recombinant between 2 genotypes, C11 and C45, it is unlikely that this property is related to its origin in a chimpanzee host. Indeed, rhinoviruses often recombine; the parent strains of RV-C45-cpz1–2013 and the genomic location of the recombination event are similar to those described previously. RV-C45-cpz1–2013 also shares with other rhinovirus C variants the capacity to infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe disease. Viral load values from this animal's oropharynx (7.41 × 10⁶ copies/swab), trachea (1.05 × 10⁷ copies/swab), and lung (1.74 × 10⁶ copies/swab) are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 × 10⁶ copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C‒infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department. Although published estimates of rhinovirus epidemiologic transmission parameters are sparse, the values estimated for the 2013 chimpanzee outbreak (transmission rate 0.68/d; duration of infection 3.2 days) are close to those of common cold viruses in humans (transmission rate 0.74/d; duration of infection 3.0 days). Despite this similarity, these values are likely similar for many acute respiratory viruses.

### Respiratory viral Co-infection in SARS-CoV-2-infected children during the early and late pandemic periods [^117P6EDj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most commonly co-detected respiratory viruses. This is in keeping with previous reports, which suggest that rhinovirus/enterovirus circulation did not decrease as much as other respiratory viruses during the early phase of the pandemic and that it surged earlier than other viruses. This is supported by a surveillance study showing that rhinoviruses/enteroviruses were the most frequently detected virus in the prepandemic and pandemic periods, across all pediatric age groups, in both the ED and inpatient settings. Moreover, while detection of rhinovirus/enterovirus was less likely between April 2020 and September 2021, detection of these viruses occurred at similar or higher rates between October 2020 and February 2021 than in the prepandemic period. The frequency of rhinovirus/enterovirus detection may be explained by evidence that children are a major reservoir for rhinovirus infection and are a key driver of transmission to adults. Additionally, it is more transmissible than other viruses (eg, influenza and SARS-CoV-2), even when surgical masks are worn.

Although rhinovirus usually causes mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and can be detected in asymptomatic children, some studies have reported that isolated pediatric rhinovirus/enterovirus infection can be severe, even more severe than RSV and influenza infections. Rhinovirus is the second most commonly identified virus in children with bronchiolitis, and it is the virus most commonly co-detected alongside RSV. Our finding that the detection of rhinovirus/enterovirus in children with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with an increased odds of severe outcomes supports the similar finding reported by Agathis et al. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring of viral infections and co-infection in children to inform strategies to prevent and mitigate the impact on children and the health care system. Moreover, enhanced respiratory virus surveillance in children, particularly those who are severely unwell, is crucial. Our findings should inform infection control practices in healthcare settings, by highlighting the importance of stringent isolation protocols to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and the development of nosocomial co-infections. Finally, public health strategies should prioritize vaccination efforts for preventable respiratory infections (eg, influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) in children.

### Hidden in plain sight: the impact of human rhinovirus infection in adults [^115FEure]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic challenges in HRV detection

Respiratory viral diagnostics have been extensively reviewed. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR) is the cornerstone of HRV detection and offers high sensitivity and specificity. Multiplex PCR panels for respiratory viruses are increasingly available to test for a range of respiratory viral pathogens simultaneously.

Historically, the role of viruses in LRIs, including HRV has generally been underappreciated owing to previous reliance on less sensitive technologies. For example, Templeton et al. demonstrated that PCR was more sensitive than traditional culture/serology for the detection of respiratory viruses in a cohort of adults with CAP, where HRV was the most commonly identified viral pathogen. Furthermore, Alimi et al. performed a meta-analysis of 21 European studies of adults with CAP. The proportion of adults with CAP with viral pathogens was 22%, but this percentage increased to 29.0% in studies where PCR was used. As expected, studies after 2010 reported higher proportions of patients with detectable respiratory viruses.

Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in detecting and differentiating HRV in clinical settings. These issues are compounded by the underutilisation of HRV testing in clinical practice, the technical limitations of molecular diagnostics, and the lack of standardisation in interpreting results.

Underutilisation of HRV testing

Although HRV plays a substantial role in acute respiratory infections (ARIs), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and exacerbations of chronic lung diseases, routine testing for HRV is not universal in adult clinical settings. Diagnostic workflows often prioritise pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), leaving HRV underrepresented. While several meta-analyses prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic identified HRV as the first or second most common virus detected in adults with CAP along with influenza, this was despite HRV being tested for less frequently. Thus, the true impact of the HRV is likely underestimated because of the relatively lower frequency of HRV testing.

### From sneeze to wheeze: what we know about rhinovirus Cs [^112X7NtA]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

While the discovery of HRV-Cs is recent, there are no indications that they are new viruses, or that they are emerging in real-time. Genetically, HRV-Cs are most closely related to the members of HRV-A and HRV-B but even a small genetic difference can impart encompass significant changes to their clinical impact, complicated by a diverse human background of prior virus exposure and underlying host immune and disease variability. It is well known that HRVs are a major trigger of asthma exacerbations and HRV-Cs are now under investigation for their potential involvement in asthma inception. The newly described HRV-Cs account for a large proportion of HRV-related illness, including common colds and wheezing exacerbations. HRV-Cs are genetically diverse and appear to circulate with seasonal variation, exchanging dominance with HRV-A. Whether HRV-Cs are consistently more pathogenic or "asthmagenic" is unproven. Antigenic diversity complicates passive and active prophylactic interventions (i.e. antibodies or vaccines), so further identification and characterisation of individual types (and their neutralising antigens) is likely to inform future preventive strategies. In the meantime, new antivirals should benefit groups at risk of the most severe disease.

### The common cold is associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections [^1143Uyqd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adults and children often respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with adults facing a higher risk of symptomatic and severe illness. We hypothesize that children's protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 may be due to more frequent respiratory viral infections, which prime their airway antiviral defenses.

Methods

Using case-cohort and case-control analyses in the Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 cohort, we evaluated whether infection with common respiratory viruses protects against SARS-CoV-2 infections and investigated airway molecular mechanisms by which this protection is achieved. We tested 10,493 longitudinal nasal swabs from 1,156 participants for 21 respiratory pathogens. We performed RNA-sequencing on 147 swabs (N = 144 participants) collected prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 391 swabs (N = 165 participants) during and before rhinovirus infection.

Results

Participants with rhinovirus infection in the previous 30 days were at 48% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR:0.52, p = 0.034). Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recent rhinovirus infection was associated with 9.6-fold lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 0.0031). Higher pre-infection expression of 57 genes was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load, including 24 antiviral defense genes; 22 of these were induced by rhinovirus infections. Relative to adults, children expressed higher levels of the antiviral gene signature (p = 0.014) and were at 2.2-fold increased risk for rhinovirus infections.

Conclusions

Rhinovirus infections, which trigger increased expression of antiviral airway genes, are linked to a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Frequent rhinovirus infections may enhance this protective gene profile, partially explaining why children experience milder SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to adults.

### Rhinovirus-induced wheezing in infancy – the first sign of childhood asthma? [^1152QPVC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although known as common causes of upper respiratory infections, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and corona-viruses are poorly studied as inducers of wheezing in infants, and their possible role in the development of childhood asthma has not been investigated.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma.

Methods

In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992–1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999.

Results

Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12%), and coronaviruses in none. Rhinoviruses were present as single viral findings in 22 (81%) of the 27 rhinovirus-positive cases, and rhinovirus infections were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy. Enteroviruses were commonly encountered in mixed infections and had no association with atopy. As single viral findings, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma (P = 0.047; odds ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.02–16.77 versus rhinovirus-negative cases [by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry)].

Conclusion

Our results present rhinoviruses as important inducers of wheezing even in infancy. The association with atopy and subsequent asthma calls for reevaluation of the role of rhinoviruses in the development of asthma.

### Human rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients: association with mortality [^116Yv77n]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses are the most common respiratory viruses detected in patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients, the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract remains unknown. We evaluated 697 recipients transplanted between 1993 and 2015 with rhinovirus in respiratory samples. As comparative cohorts, 273 recipients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (N = 117), parainfluenza virus (N = 120), or influenza (N = 36) were analyzed. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 569 subjects with rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection and 128 subjects with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection, probabilities of overall mortality at 90 days were 6% and 41%, respectively (P < 0.001). The survival rate after lower respiratory tract infection was not affected by the presence of co-pathogens (55% in patients with co-pathogens, 64% in patients without, P = 0.34). Low monocyte count (P = 0.027), oxygen use (P = 0.015), and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day (P = 0.003) before diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality among patients with lower respiratory tract infection in multivariable analysis. Mortality after rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection was similar to that after lower respiratory tract infection by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or influenza in an adjusted model. In summary, transplant recipients with rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract had high mortality rates comparable to viral pneumonia associated with other well-established respiratory viruses. Our data suggest rhinovirus can contribute to severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised hosts.

### Evolving concepts in how viruses impact asthma: a work group report of the microbes in allergy committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^115jEbjS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Early-life viral wheezing and subsequent asthma risk — At the age of 6 years, children who had wheezing illness in the first 3 years of life show increased asthma risk with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (odds ratio 2.6), rhinovirus (RV) (odds ratio 9.8), or both RSV and RV (odds ratio 10.0). RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization each year in the United States in children younger than 1 year of age, and RVs are the most frequently detected viruses in wheezing children older than 1 year and in children and adults with acute exacerbations of asthma.

### Prevention and treatment of asthma exacerbations in adults [^115FF178]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are major contributors to disease morbidity in patients of all ages. To develop strategies that reduce the disease burden from exacerbations, it is helpful to review current concepts about the risk factors for asthma attacks and current approaches for prevention and treatment. Multiple factors contribute as risks and to the development of asthma exacerbations, including allergic and infectious processes. Viral respiratory infections, primarily from rhinoviruses, are the dominant exacerbating cause for most asthma patients. Allergic sensitization and allergen exposure contribute directly and enhance susceptibility for respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses infect airway epithelium to promote underlying type 2 inflammation with eosinophils, the predominant cellular component of increased inflammation. Deficiencies of antiviral interferon responses and generation have been identified that increase susceptibility to viral infections in asthma. Exacerbation treatment focuses on reducing airflow obstruction and suppressing inflammation, followed by improving long-term asthma control. Increasing concern exists regarding the side effects associated with frequent systemic corticosteroid use. A major advance has been the selective use of biologics to prevent exacerbations, primarily in patients with existing type 2 inflammation. Future research to prevent exacerbations is being directed toward antiviral activity and a more encompassing regulation of underlying airway inflammation.

### A, B, and C rhinoviruses: new knowledge from an impressive consortium. A step forward for rhinovirus vaccine efforts or a step back? [^1162LeCn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors detected 178 RV types, identifying 21 more RV strains circulating than previously identified (157). They also showed certain strains (RV-A12, 78, and 101 and RV-C02 and 11) were more commonly detected consistently over the 12-year time span of sample collection. However, the most frequently detected type (RV-A78) was only detected in 2.7% of samples, so no single RV strain accounted for more than a very small percentage of RV infections.

Consistent with the COAST findings, RV-Cs were more common than RV-As until 4–5 years old, but thereafter, RV-A infections became progressively more common, outnumbering RV-C by ∼2:1 from age ∼15.

Consistent with previous reports, RV-Cs were more likely associated with wheeze, and the CDHR3 rs6967330 asthma risk allele significantly increased the risk of RV-C illness, both relationships being independent of age.

I congratulate the authors for performing these extensive and detailed investigations and for significantly extending our understanding of RV species in childhood. I hope their work will stimulate further similar work in different age groups and with greater numbers of virus strains to increase our understanding even further.

The authors hope their work may assist vaccine development strategies for RV-C strains for use in early life. However, by 1) showing that RV-A strains outnumber RV-C strains by 2:1 after age 15, and thus that RV-A vaccines are desperately needed in addition to RV-C vaccines, and 2) identifying that 21 more RV strains than previously known were actively circulating (as were almost all the previously known strains), thus requiring any pan-RV vaccine to cover 178 strains rather than 157 strains, they may have made the job of actually developing effective RV vaccines that little bit harder!

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^114cuM7R]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of current vaccination strategies for upper respiratory tract infections

While vaccination is a cornerstone in preventing URTIs, several limitations hinder its comprehensive efficacy. One significant constraint is the limited induction of mucosal immunity by traditional intramuscular vaccines. These vaccines primarily stimulate systemic immune responses but may not elicit robust immunity at mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa, which are primary entry points for respiratory pathogens. This limitation can result in reduced effectiveness in preventing initial infection and transmission of respiratory viruses. Additionally, the specificity of vaccines to pathogens means they may not protect against the wide array of viruses responsible for URTIs. For instance, while vaccines exist for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, there are currently no approved vaccines for common URTI-causing viruses like rhinoviruses and certain coronaviruses. This gap leaves individuals susceptible to infections from these prevalent pathogens. Furthermore, vaccine efficacy can be compromised in certain populations. Elderly individuals and those with immunocompromising conditions often exhibit diminished immune responses to vaccination, leading to lower levels of protection. This is particularly concerning given that these groups are at higher risk for severe outcomes from URTIs. These limitations underscore the need for complementary strategies to enhance protection against URTIs.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of URTIs are vital components that have a significant impact on the evolution of diseases and overall health conditions in patients of all age groups. Receiving an immunity enhancer with an antiviral effect early has the potential to not only reduce the risk of recurrence and complications, but also help reduce antibiotic consumption. Any reasonable solution that can result in a reduction in antibiotic consumption among the population is considered favorable. To tackle this growing resistance, it is vital to use antibiotics appropriately at the necessary times, including the use of suitable dose intervals and for the relevant duration.

Therapeutic approaches targeted at improving and modulating immunity are appropriate not only for the effective treatment of persisting infections of the upper respiratory tract but also for the prevention of recurrence and upcoming complications. The use of antibiotics in an irrational manner not only leads to antibiotic resistance but may also have negative and even occasionally irreversible effects on the intestinal microbiota. Maintaining and protecting the intestinal microbiota and avoiding its alteration are crucial steps toward effective URTI treatment.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^112GnHQz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Although there is no standard definition for the common cold (see Appendix 1), it is generally defined as a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract (URT), characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing. Other symptoms associated with the common cold include cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 100 ºF/37.8 ºC) (Eccles 2009). A temperature of 100 ºF/37.8 ºC or higher for three to four days is typically associated with influenza and other respiratory diseases (see Appendix 2) (DDCP 2010). Despite the fact that the common cold is not considered to be a deadly disease, bacterial complications can lead to high morbidity and mortality (Giraud‐Gatineau 2020; Veiga 2021).

The common cold is a disease of diverse aetiology (see Appendix 3) (Heikkinen 2003). Premature babies, children, the elderly, and other populations with comorbidities such as chronic lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), congenital heart disease, and asthma are more prone to viral infections that cause the common cold, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza, coronavirus, and adenovirus (non‐polio) (Johnston 2017; Lu 2020; Rubner 2017; Shibata 2018). Additionally, in humans, coronavirus such as the HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐NL63, and HCoV‐HKU1 strains are responsible for URT infections (URTI) associated with the common cold (Zumla 2016). It has been shown that 1% to 10% of the population is infected with the HCoV‐NL63 coronavirus annually (Szelazek 2017). Even the infectious agent SARS‐CoV‐2 can be associated with the common cold (Zimmermann 2020). The transmission of the common cold occurs through aerosols, direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (DeGeorge 2019; L'Huillier 2015; Reynolds 2016); the primary factors that contribute to the spread of this disease include poor hand hygiene, overcrowding, and interactions in places such as schools, day‐care centres, and between households (Adler 2018; Alexandrino 2016).

### Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of different enterovirus and rhinovirus types show that EV-D68 may still have an impact on severity of respiratory infections [^112cxert]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that most EV and RV types have a weak association to symptoms and severity of respiratory infections caused by the viruses, with the exception of EV‐D68, which may cause more severe disease and more often dyspnea. We warrant further studies on this EV type to elucidate its prevalence among different patients and its role in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infection. Also, the role of CV‐A10 in respiratory disease merits further investigation. There is a great need for broad prospective studies on EV and RV types, including patients suffering from mild or severe illness, from both hospital and primary care.

### Role of viral infections, atopy and antiviral immunity in the etiology of wheezing exacerbations among children and young adults [^111m2c7E]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

At least 101 serotypes of rhinoviruses have been identified. Rhinoviruses have often been associated with trivial upper respiratory infections but more recent evidence suggests that they play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.

Methods

The impact of rhinoviruses as a cause of respiratory morbidity in infancy and the role of rhinoviruses in causing asthma exacerbations in the children and adult population is discussed. Past and current experimental and epidemiologic evidence was assessed to suggest a causal role rather than just an association. Mechanism of susceptibility to virus infection in asthmatics were discussed, as were data indicating important interactions between allergic sensitization and rhinovirus infections in risk of asthma exacerbations.

Results

Asthmatic individuals have increased severity and duration of lower airway symptoms and greater declines in lung function upon infection with rhinovirus, suggesting greater susceptibility to rhinovirus infection because of impaired antiviral immunity. Early virus-induced apoptosis, which aborts virus replication, was impaired in asthmatics. Treating allergic airway inflammation may reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms triggered by rhinoviruses.

Conclusions

The evidence in children and young adults suggests that atopy and allergic inflammation in the airways may be critical determinants of an adverse response to rhinovirus. Increased awareness of the spectrum of age groups that are affected by rhinoviruses is needed to encourage the development of new treatments and strategies that may be helpful in reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms triggered by rhinoviruses.

### Viral respiratory infections in association with asthma and sinusitis: a review [^111tCcJB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) commonly precede asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Likewise, VRIs may affect the paranasal sinuses, predisposing infected individuals to the development of subsequent acute bacterial sinusitis. This article discusses the role that viruses play in both the development of asthma and in acute asthma exacerbations. Mechanisms by which viral infections provoke asthma exacerbations are reviewed, and treatment of such episodes is discussed. The pathogenesis of sinusitis and association with VRIs is reviewed along with treatment recommendations.

Data Sources

Relevant articles in the medical literature were reviewed with sources including randomized, controlled clinical trials, review articles, epidemiologic studies, and standard textbooks in allergy and immunology.

Conclusions

This review highlights the prominent role that viral pathogens (especially rhinovirus) play in exacerbation of asthma and in the development of sinus disease. The specific mechanisms whereby viral infection leads to an acute asthma exacerbation or to subsequent bacterial sinusitis are described.

### New respiratory enterovirus and recombinant rhinoviruses among circulating picornaviruses [^113qSFJs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and enteroviruses (HEVs) are leading causes of infection in humans. These 2 picornaviruses share an identical genomic organization, have similar functional RNA secondary structures, and are classified within the same genus because of their high sequence homology. However, despite their common genomic features, these 2 groups of viruses have different phenotypic characteristics. In vivo, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas enteroviruses infect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other sites such as the central nervous system. However, some enteroviruses exhibit specific respiratory tropism and thus have properties similar to rhinoviruses. In vitro, most HRVs and HEVs differ by their optimal growth temperature, acid tolerance, receptor usage, and cell tropism. The genomic basis for these phenotypic differences between similar viruses is not yet fully understood.

HRVs and HEVs are characterized by ≈100 serotypes. Recently, molecular diagnostic tools have shown that this diversity expands beyond those predefined serotypes and encompasses also previously unrecognized rhinovirus and enterovirus genotypes. As an example, a new HRV lineage named HRV-C was recently identified and now complements the 2 previously known A and B lineages (N.J. Knowles, pers. comm.). The C lineage has not only a distinct phylogeny but is also characterized by specific cis-acting RNA structures.

In this study, we screened a large number of persons with acute respiratory diseases by using assays designed to overcome the diversity of both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses circulating in humans. Whenever possible, we systematically sequenced 5′ untranslated region (UTR), capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of strains. Our goals were 1) to characterize the diversity of circulating rhinoviruses and, to a lesser extent, enteroviruses, to identify putative new picornavirus variants, and 2) to assess whether recombination may drive HRV evolution, which has not been shown in natural human infections.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115EfGbk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on community-acquired pneumonia:

- **Definition**: CAP is an acute infection of the lungs occurring in an individual who has had little contact with the healthcare system.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of CAP include bacterial infections (such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus) and respiratory viruses (such as influenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus). No causative organism is identified in over 50% of patients.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of CAP is estimated at 248 cases per 100,000 person-years. In adults ≥ 65 years of age, the incidence increases to 630–1640 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The most common complications of CAP include parapneumonic effusion and empyema, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Influenza and bacterial pneumonia are strongly associated with cardiac events including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and HF. Other pathogen-specific complications include Streptococcus pneumonia-associated HUS, rhabdomyolysis and AKI often seen in Legionella pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia-induced rash and mucositis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like), and reactive arthritis after Chlamydia pneumonia. CAP can be classified by severity and setting of care. Nonsevere pneumonia typically presents without signs of respiratory failure or sepsis and is managed in the outpatient or general hospital ward setting. Severe pneumonia is characterized by clinical features, such as respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, uremia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, or hypotension requiring fluids. Non-ICU pneumonia refers to hospitalized patients who do not require intensive care, while ICU pneumonia involves patients with acute respiratory failure or septic shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients requiring hospitalization, CAP is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of 11%.

### Clinical and molecular features of human rhinovirus C [^116dEFAA]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

A newly discovered group of human rhinoviruses (HRVs) has been classified as the HRV-C species based on distinct genomic features. HRV-Cs circulate worldwide, and are important causes of upper and lower respiratory illnesses. Methods to culture and produce these viruses have recently been developed, and should enable identification of unique features of HRV-C replication and biology.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^111thJex]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory infections — background for pediatric residential facilities — note that people can become ill with upper tract or lower tract respiratory infections, and viruses that cause respiratory infections include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and the new coronaviruses most commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections. In infants, RSV bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization for respiratory disease, and in severely immune compromised individuals and people with underlying conditions, RSV pneumonia carries high morbidity and mortality. Most respiratory viruses spread through respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing, and for certain respiratory viruses, such as RSV, a person also can get sick from direct contact with infected respiratory secretions or objects that have been contaminated with infectious droplets. Respiratory infections caused by bacteria spread by droplets expelled by the person who is sick before they have received 24 hours of effective antibiotics, and notable pandemics have included 2009 influenza virus H1N1 and late 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 which quickly spread across the globe.

### Acerca de los rinovirus | Rhinoviruses… [^111gbv9R]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Información general Los rinovirus son la causa más frecuente del resfriado común y son un desencadenante viral común de los ataques de asma. La mayoría de las infecciones por rinovirus no causan síntomas o presentan síntomas leves. También pueden causar enfermedad grave, especialmente si tiene el sistema inmunitario debilitado, asma u otra condición médica subyacente. No existen vacunas para prevenir la infección por rinovirus. Sin embargo, existen vacunas para otros virus respiratorios que pueden causar consecuencias graves en algunas personas. Para adultos y niños de 6 meses o más, los CDC recomiendan recibir una vacuna actual contra el COVID-19 y la influenza. Los CDC también recomiendan la inmunización contra el VRS para proteger a los bebés. Los adultos de 60 años o más deberían hablar con su proveedor de atención médica sobre si una vacuna contra el VRS es adecuada para ellos.

Signos y síntomas Es posible que no presente signos ni síntomas cuando esté infectado con un rinovirus. Si presenta síntomas, por lo general duran menos de 7 días, pero pueden durar hasta 2 semanas. Sus síntomas pueden ser similares a los de otras infecciones respiratorias. Es más probable que se vuelvan graves en los grupos con mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente. Los signos y síntomas comunes incluyen:

- Moqueo o congestión nasal
- Tos
- Estornudos
- Dolor de garganta
- Dolor de cabeza
- Dolores del cuerpo leves
- **Fiebre La enfermedad más grave es menos común, pero puede incluir**:

- Ataques de asma y enfermedad reactiva de las vías respiratorias
- Infecciones del oído medio
- Sinusitis
- Bronquiolitis
- Bronquitis
- Neumonía Obtenga información sobre cómo manejar sus síntomas y cuándo buscar atención médica. Prevención Usted puede tomar medidas para reducir el riesgo de contraer rinovirus y reducir el riesgo de propagación si se enferma. Obtenga más información:

- RSV
- Adenovirus
- Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
- Parainfluenza
- Parvovirus B19 Bacterial. Symptoms Respiratory viruses may affect both the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. Some viruses that affect the nose and throat can progress to cause serious lung infections, such as pneumonia. Examples of symptoms affecting the respiratory tract:

- Runny or stuffy nose
- New loss of taste or smell
- Sore throat
- Cough. Other possible symptoms:

- Headache
- Muscle or body aches
- Fever
