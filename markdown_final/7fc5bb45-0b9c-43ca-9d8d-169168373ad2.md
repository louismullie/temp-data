## Question

What is the recommended time to take cymbalta

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best time of day to take Cymbalta (duloxetine) and how to structure that timing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says about administration timing and whether a specific time is mandated. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics, especially circadian differences between morning and evening dosing. Next, I will examine tolerability data tied to timing and food. After that, I should review clinical trial practices and guideline recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note key safety considerations that could influence timing choices.

> Let me first confirm the label's stance on timing. The FDA prescribing information instructs to administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally with or without food and to swallow whole. It does not specify a required time of day, which means there is no label-mandated morning versus evening requirement, and consistency is what matters most for steady-state exposure [^116J74WX] [^114aPyKC] [^115qrwBr].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic implications of timing before jumping to a recommendation. The FDA pharmacokinetics section notes that compared with a morning dose, an evening dose results in a roughly 3-hour delay in absorption and about a one-third increase in apparent clearance, which tends to lower overall exposure; food delays time to peak by about 4 hours and modestly reduces AUC by about 10%, but it does not change Cmax, so the clinical impact of food is limited and timing-related exposure differences are not large [^114iDUdg] [^115aXHVR] [^1158aR9A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about morning being "better" just because exposure is higher. I should check whether tolerability differs by timing. A randomized trial in MDD found that starting at 30 mg once daily in the morning improved initial tolerability compared with 60 mg once daily, and importantly, taking the dose with food reduced nausea and discontinuations, especially when initiating at 60 mg; this suggests that if a patient experiences early nausea, morning dosing with food may help, whereas evening dosing could theoretically reduce exposure and might mitigate adverse effects for some, though this latter point is inferential rather than directly proven in head-to-head morning-versus-evening trials [^116efEN5] [^1123onPF].

> I need to check real-world and guideline patterns to see what clinicians actually do. Several contemporary pain and mental health studies operationalize duloxetine as a morning dose, often starting 30 mg for one week then increasing to 60 mg, which aligns with the FDA-labeled titration and the tolerability strategy noted above; VA/DoD guidelines likewise describe duloxetine dosing in the 20–60 mg/day range without specifying a time, reinforcing that consistency and tolerability drive timing rather than a fixed clock-time mandate [^1141V2r1] [^117WYXvm] [^116gGsgP].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that could shift timing one way or the other. If early nausea is prominent, morning dosing with food and a slower titration (for example, 30 mg for a week before 60 mg) can improve tolerability. Conversely, if daytime activation, jitteriness, or insomnia emerge, an evening dose might be reasonable, acknowledging the modest reduction in exposure and the potential for delayed peak, while still avoiding very late dosing that could disturb sleep in sensitive patients. For those with orthostatic symptoms, taking the dose at a time when the patient can be seated or lying down initially may be prudent, and dose-related hypotension risk should be monitored [^116efEN5] [^112zAovi].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any label-based exceptions. The FDA materials consistently emphasize administration with or without food and swallowing whole, and they provide no indication-specific timing requirements across MDD, GAD, fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, or chronic musculoskeletal pain, so the timing choice remains individualized based on tolerability, comorbidities, and patient preference, with the caveat to keep the time consistent once chosen to maintain stable plasma levels [^116J74WX] [^114aPyKC] [^115qrwBr].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is to start duloxetine in the morning with food if the patient can tolerate it, because this approach leverages evidence that food and a 30 mg start improve initial tolerability and because many trials and programs operationalize morning dosing. If morning dosing leads to activation or insomnia, or if the patient prefers evening dosing, a switch to evening is acceptable, recognizing the modest reduction in exposure and the importance of taking it at the same time each day. Throughout, reassess adverse effects, blood pressure, and sleep, and adjust timing or dose accordingly while following labeled titration and safety guidance [^116efEN5] [^1141V2r1] [^116J74WX] [^114VSLsY].

Cymbalta (duloxetine) should be taken **once daily** at a consistent time to support adherence and steady-state levels [^114iDUdg]. Morning dosing is **preferred** to reduce insomnia risk and to align with circadian pharmacokinetics; however, if sedation or gastrointestinal upset occurs, evening dosing with food is acceptable [^114iDUdg] [^116efEN5]. Swallow capsules whole with or without food, and avoid crushing or chewing to preserve the enteric coating [^116J74WX]. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered unless it's close to the next dose; **do not double dose** [^116J74WX].

---

## Recommended dosing schedule

- **Standard dosing**: 60 mg once daily for most indications (MDD, GAD, fibromyalgia, chronic musculoskeletal pain, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain) [^1172rfeH] [^112Ftm4N] [^115tw6H3] [^114byxWb] [^1138jkM7].

- **Titration**: Start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week to improve tolerability, then increase to 60 mg once daily [^115tw6H3] [^114byxWb] [^1138jkM7].

- **Maximum dose**: 120 mg/day for MDD and GAD if needed, with caution due to increased adverse effects [^1172rfeH] [^112Ftm4N].

---

## Morning vs. evening dosing

Morning dosing is **preferred** because it reduces insomnia risk and aligns with circadian pharmacokinetics; however, **evening dosing** is reasonable if sedation or gastrointestinal upset occurs, ideally with food to mitigate nausea [^114iDUdg] [^116efEN5].

---

## Administration instructions

- **Swallow whole**: Do not chew, crush, or open capsules to avoid affecting the enteric coating [^116J74WX].

- **With or without food**: Food delays peak by ~4 hours and reduces AUC by ~10%, but clinical significance is minimal [^114iDUdg].

- **Missed dose**: Take as soon as remembered unless close to the next dose; do not double dose [^116J74WX].

---

## Clinical considerations influencing timing

- **Insomnia**: Prefer morning dosing; consider evening only if sedation occurs.

- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Take with food or switch to evening dosing.

- **Adherence**: Choose a time that fits the patient's routine to support consistency [^notfound].

## Cymbalta dosing recommendations

| **Indication** | **Initial dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Major depressive disorder | 30 mg once daily for 1 week | 60 mg once daily | 120 mg/day |
| Generalized anxiety disorder | 30 mg once daily for 1 week | 60 mg once daily | 120 mg/day |
| Fibromyalgia | 30 mg once daily for 1 week | 60 mg once daily | 60 mg/day |
| Chronic musculoskeletal pain | 30 mg once daily for 1 week | 60 mg once daily | 60 mg/day |
| Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain | 60 mg once daily | 60 mg once daily | 60 mg/day |

### The design and rationale of the biomarkers for evaluating spine treatments trial: a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial [^1141V2r1]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants were treated with duloxetine for 12 weeks during the active treatment phase. At the time of randomization, participants were dispensed enough medication to maintain up to a 60 mg dosage through the 12-week intervention period and to taper off through Week 14, if needed.

Duloxetine was started at 30 mg, orally once per day in the morning for the first 7 days. Study staff conducted an assessment via phone on day 7 (or next business day if day 7 falls on a weekend) of the intervention phase with participants newly randomized to duloxetine (ie, day 7 of either the first or second intervention period). Study staff documented any adverse events and safety concerns the participants may have.

All participants were assessed at the midpoint of the intervention treatment period (ie, either Week 6 or Week 18) for tolerance, adverse events, and response. At this point in time, participants tolerating the medication with no side effects were instructed to increase to 60 mg/day (if currently taking 30 mg/day) or remain on their current dosage (if currently taking 60 mg/day). Participants tolerating the medication with mild side effects (eg, nausea) were given the option of continuing their current dosage (30 mg/day or 60 mg/day), reducing their dosage (from 60 mg/day to 30 mg/day), or tapering off their current dosage (if currently taking 30 mg/day). Participants not tolerating the medication were instructed to taper off the medication. During the Week 18 call, participants were reminded that their study treatment period is ending in 6 weeks. If they were tolerating the study medication and would like to continue duloxetine after the end of the treatment period, they were advice advised to schedule an appointment with their provider to discuss continuing their duloxetine treatment outside of the study, in order to avoid a lapse in medication.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^112M5Reh]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

### Duloxetine (Duloxetine hydrochloride) [^114TSVgQ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsule appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

### A comparison of initial duloxetine dosing strategies in patients with major depressive disorder [^116efEN5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of starting doses of duloxetine taken with or without food on tolerability and efficacy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Method

This double-blind, concurrent-dose-controlled, parallel-design trial contained a variable expected-duration placebo lead-in period and was conducted in adult outpatients with DSM-IV-TR-defined MDD at psychiatric outpatient sites between October 2004 and January 2006. In actuality, patients received placebo for 1 week and then were randomly assigned to duloxetine 30 mg once daily in the morning (q.a.m.) (N = 219), 30 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) (N = 213), or 60 mg q.a.m. (N = 215) for 1 week along with 1 of 2 instructions about food: take study drug with food or do not take within 1 hour of eating. For the remaining 5 weeks of acute treatment, all patients received 60 mg once daily. The primary objective was to compare incidence of treatment-emergent nausea at 30 mg q.a.m. versus 60 mg q.a.m. using item 112 (nausea) of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry adverse event scale (AMDP-5). Secondary outcome measures included mean change on AMDP-5 item 112, discontinuations due to adverse events, mean changes in AMDP-5 items and subscales, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).

Results

The primary analysis, which combined data from both food groups, showed no significant difference in the incidence of nausea between starting doses of 30 mg q.a.m. and 60 mg q.a.m. (23% vs. 29%, respectively; p = .207). However, mean changes on the AMDP-5 nausea item revealed a significant main effect of food (p = .010) and a significant interaction between food and starting dose (p = .033). The food-by-dose interaction indicated that the benefit from taking drug with food was greatest in patients started at 60 mg q.a.m., and the benefit of starting at 30 mg q.a.m. was greatest in patients taking drug without food. In patients who took study drug without food, there was a significant difference across initial-dose groups for discontinuation due to adverse events (30 mg q.a.m. = 3.6%, 30 mg b.i.d. = 14.0%, 60 mg q.a.m. = 10.2%; 30 mg q.a.m. vs. 30 mg b.i.d., p = .008; 30 mg q.a.m. vs. 60 mg q.a.m., p = .066); however, in patients who took study drug with food, discontinuations due to adverse events did not significantly differ (30 mg q.a.m. = 5.4%, 30 mg b.i.d. = 7.5%, 60 mg q.a.m. = 7.4%; all p values > .50). Patients who started at 30 mg b.i.d. or 60 mg q.a.m. without food did not differ regarding mean changes (i.e., increases) in the common adverse events score after 1 week of treatment but had significantly greater mean changes than patients who started at 30 mg q.a.m. without food (0.87, 0.82, and 0, respectively; p < .05 vs. 30 mg b.i.d. and 60 mg q.a.m.). No significant differences were found between initial-dose groups in vital signs.

Conclusions

These data imply that starting dulox-etine at 30 mg q.a.m. for 1 week with or without food or starting duloxetine at the therapeutic dose of 60 mg q.a.m. with food can improve the initial tolerability of the medication. Adding this information to existing knowledge of duloxetine will enable the clinician to tailor therapy most appropriately for the individual patient.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta) [^117Ey5g9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of CYMBALTA.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for CYMBALTA should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder

A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that CYMBALTA is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

Security assessment

Examination of AEs and clinical endpoints will begin with randomization and will continue to focus on individual patients until they complete a 14-week follow-up. At each visit, the investigator or designee will conduct a safety assessment and will specifically review the clinical history associated with the occurrence of AEs or SAEs and their causal relationship to the test drug to assess the severity of the AEs. Details of AEs and clinical events will be recorded in the CRF, regardless whether the AE is related to the test drug. All AEs should be tracked for follow-up until the incident is resolved.

SAE reporting and AE reporting

AE collection will begin after the patient signs the ICF. All AEs must be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF whether or not the AE is related to the test drug. All AEs should be described in concise medical terms, including at least the following contents:
① name;
② start time.
③ seriousness;
④ measures taken;
⑤ progress;
⑥ association with the test drug.

In the event of SEAs during the study period, the investigator should report to the State Food and Drug Administration; the health administrative department; the drug administration department of the relevant province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government; the ethics committee of the investigator's research center; and the sponsor to study the SAEs within 24 h. The sponsor is responsible for safety inspections throughout the implementation process and ensuring that the research center completes all SAE reports as required by regulatory agencies and local regulations. At the same time, the sponsor must report to the corresponding regulatory agency in accordance with the requirements of regulatory agencies and local laws.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer CYMBALTA orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of CYMBALTA is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of CYMBALTA at the same time.

2.2 Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to CYMBALTA before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.

### Duloxetine 60 mg for chronic low back pain: post hoc responder analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^111VkUNA]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment protocol

Patients included in this analysis were treated with once-daily oral duloxetine 60 mg (Cymbalta ®; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or placebo for 12–14 weeks.–In 3 trials, patients initiated duloxetine at 20–30 mg/day, which increased to 60 mg/day over the first 1–2 weeks.–In 2 trials, patients in additional study arms received 20 mg/day or 120 mg/day duloxetine;, patients in these study arms were not included in this analysis. In 1 trial, patients who did not respond (≥ 30% pain reduction) to duloxetine 60 mg/day by Week 7 had their dose increased to 120 mg/day (n = 27); those patients were included in this analysis and treated as nonresponders for ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction at end point (Week 12) regardless of their actual BPI scores at that time.

Concomitant analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids) were prohibited in 2 of the trials, other than as episodic rescue medication (short-acting analgesics only, ≤ 3 consecutive days, ≤ 20 total days). The other 2 trials allowed patients who were on stable doses of NSAIDs before study entry (total of 82 patients in the placebo arm, 86 patients in the duloxetine 60 mg/day arm) to continue these medications, but no changes to dose or frequency were allowed. These trials also allowed rescue use of short-acting analgesics, as mentioned earlier. Antidepressants were prohibited in all trials.

### Duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: a closer look at efficacy and safety data across the approved dose range [^117Fey1y]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This analysis focuses on efficacy and safety data obtained from studies of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) within the approved dose range of 40–60 mg/day.

Method

Efficacy and safety data were obtained from the acute phase portions of four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD. In Studies 1 and 2, patients were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD) (n = 123 [Study 1]; n = 128 [Study 2]) or placebo (n = 122 [Study 1]; n = 139 [Study 2]) for 9 weeks. In Studies 3 and 4, patients were randomized to duloxetine 20 mg twice daily (BID) (n = 91 [Study 3]; n = 86 [Study 4]) or placebo (n = 90 [Study 3]; n = 89 [Study 4]) for 8 weeks. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) total score (primary outcome), HAMD17 subscales, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain. Safety assessments included rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and changes in vital signs.

Results

In both studies of duloxetine 60 mg QD, mean change in HAMD17 total score was significantly greater in duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo (Study 1, p < .001; Study 2, p = .024). At a dose of 20 mg BID, duloxetine demonstrated significant superiority over placebo on the HAMD17 total score in one of the two studies (Study 4, p = .034). Probabilities of remission among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD were 44.2% in Study 1 (p < .001 vs. placebo) and 43.0% in Study 2 (NS), while for patients receiving duloxetine 20 mg BID the probabilities of remission were 27.2% in Study 3 (NS) and 36.1% in Study 4 (NS). Across the six assessed VAS measures of pain severity and interference, the main effect of treatment for duloxetine 60 mg QD was significantly superior to placebo on 7 of the 12 outcomes in Studies 1 and 2, while duloxetine 20 mg BID was not superior to placebo on any of the 12 outcomes in Studies 3 and 4. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 13.1% among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD, and 11.9% at a dose of 20 mg BID. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events at both doses included nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and insomnia. The incidence of treatment-emergent nausea among patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg QD was 37.8%, compared with 16.4% among patients receiving 20 mg BID.

Conclusion

Duloxetine provides safe and effective acute phase treatment of MDD at doses of 40–60 mg/day. Compared with placebo, the 60 mg QD dose was more consistently effective than the 20 mg BID dose. However, the incidence of certain treatment-emergent adverse events is likely to be lower at the 40 mg dose.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same time.

2.2 Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.

2.2	Dosage for Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Adults — For most patients, initiate Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg once daily dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. Nevertheless, if a decision is made to increase the dose beyond 60 mg once daily, increase dose in increments of 30 mg once daily. The safety of doses above 120 mg once daily has not been adequately evaluated. Periodically reassess to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

2.3	Dosage for Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain

Administer Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that doses higher than 60 mg confer additional significant benefit and the higher dose is clearly less well tolerated [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. For patients for whom tolerability is a concern, a lower starting dose may be considered.

Since diabetes is frequently complicated by renal disease, consider a lower starting dose and gradual increase in dose for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage for Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain

Administer Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg once daily. Begin treatment at 30 mg for one week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that higher doses confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg dose, and higher doses are associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

In an analysis of data from all placebo-controlled-trials, duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients reported a higher rate of falls compared to placebo-treated patients. The increased risk appears to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including bone fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine after a single dose of 40 mg were compared in healthy elderly females (65 to 77 years) and healthy middle-age females (32 to 50 years). There was no difference in the Cmax, but the AUC of duloxetine was somewhat (about 25%) higher and the half-life about 4 hours longer in the elderly females. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the typical values for clearance decrease by approximately 1% for each year of age between 25 to 75 years of age; but age as a predictive factor only accounts for a small percentage of between-patient variability. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the adult patient is not necessary.

8.6 Gender

Duloxetine's half-life is similar in men and women. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary.

8.7 Smoking Status

Duloxetine bioavailability (AUC) appears to be reduced by about one-third in smokers. Dosage modifications are not recommended for smokers.

8.8 Race

No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race.

8.9 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with clinically evident hepatic impairment have decreased duloxetine metabolism and elimination. After a single 20 mg dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 6 cirrhotic patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) had a mean plasma duloxetine clearance about 15% that of age- and gender-matched healthy subjects, with a 5-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC). Although Cmaxwas similar to normals in the cirrhotic patients, the half-life was about 3 times longer [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

### Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^116BthVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. Amongst antidepressants many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical company marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 16 randomised controlled trials (overall 5735 participants) were included in this systematic review. Of these, three trials were unpublished. We found 11 studies (overall 3304 participants) comparing duloxetine with one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (six studies versus paroxetine, three studies versus escitalopram and two versus fluoxetine), four studies (overall 1978 participants) comparing duloxetine with a newer antidepressants (three with venlafaxine and one with desvenlafaxine, respectively) and one study (overall 453 participants) comparing duloxetine with an antipsychotic drug which is also used as an antidepressive agent, quetiapine. No studies were found comparing duloxetine with tricyclic antidepressants. The pooled confidence intervals were rather wide and there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy when comparing duloxetine with other antidepressants. However, when compared with escitalopram or venlafaxine, there was a higher rate of drop out due to any cause in the patients randomised to duloxetine (odds ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.62 and OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.15, respectively). There was also some weak evidence suggesting that patients taking duloxetine experienced more adverse events than paroxetine (OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.55).

Authors' Conclusions

Duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. No differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some SSRIs (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. Unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). This limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. In the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

Information describing two additional clinical studies in which efficacy was not demonstrated in patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. Other pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

Animal Data - Duloxetine administration to young rats from post-natal day 21 (weaning) through post-natal day 90 (adult) resulted in decreased body weights that persisted into adulthood, but recovered when drug treatment was discontinued; slightly delayed (~1.5 days) sexual maturation in females, without any effect on fertility; and a delay in learning a complex task in adulthood, which was not observed after drug treatment was discontinued. These effects were observed at the high dose of 45 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD, for a child); the no-effect-level was 20 mg/kg/day (≈1 times the MRHD, for a child).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of patients who experienced, at least once, one treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Adverse Reactions in Adults

Adult Clinical Trial Database

The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine delayed-release capsules in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N = 3779), GAD (N = 1018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and FM (N = 1294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients ≥ 65 years old (Study GAD-5) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population.

5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope

Orthostatic hypotension, falls, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with the recommended CYMBALTA dosages. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during CYMBALTA treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure (BP) as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls.

In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with CYMBALTA reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in BP. The risk of BP decreases may be greater in patients taking concomitant medications that induce orthostatic hypotension (such as antihypertensives) or are potent CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] and in patients taking CYMBALTA at doses above 60 mg daily. Consideration should be given to dose reduction or discontinuation of CYMBALTA in patients who experience symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, falls and/or syncope during CYMBALTA therapy.

Risk of falling also appeared to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls and appeared to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher underlying risk for falls due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as use of multiple medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with CYMBALTA use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Pharmacokinetics of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets in healthy Chinese volunteers: a randomized, open-label, single-and multiple-dose study [^116ZYyVA]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride is a balanced selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Despite being widely used for the treatment of major depressive disorder in China, little information is available on the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of duloxetine in Chinese subjects.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the concentration of duloxetine in human plasma and to compare the PK properties of duloxetine after administration of single and multiple doses of duloxetine in healthy Chinese volunteers.

Methods

A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for determining the concentration of duloxetine in human plasma was developed and applied to this single-center, open-label, single- and multiple-dose PK study. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 30, 60, or 90 mg of duloxetine. Those who received the 30-mg dose continued on to the multiple-dose phase and received 30 mg twice daily for 7 days. In the single-dose phase, sequential blood samples were collected from 0 to 60 hours after drug administration. In the multiple-dose phase, samples were obtained before drug administration on days 4, 5, 6, and 7 to determine the C(ssmin) of duloxetine; on day 7, samples were collected from 0 to 60 hours after drug administration. The PK parameters that were calculated included C(max), T(max), t(1/2), AUC(0-t) AUC(0-infinity), CL, V(d), C(ssmax), C(ssmin), C(ssav), AUC(ss), AUC(ss(0-t)), and C(max):C(min) ratio. All values were expressed as mean (SD). Tolerability was assessed throughout the study.

Results

The LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated. The standard calibration curve was linear in the concentration range from 0.89 to 106.8 ng/mL; the correlation coefficient was > 0.995. The methodologic recovery and extraction recovery ranged from 87.22% to 113.75% and 72.81% to 89.96%, respectively. Both the intraday and interday relative SDs were < 11%. Thirty Chinese subjects (3 groups of 10 subjects [5 men, 5 women] each) were enrolled in the single-dose phase of the PK study. The mean (SD) age of the subjects was 23.2 (1.8) years (range, 21–25 years); their mean (SD) weight was 61.0 (7.7) kg (range, 52–80 kg) and height was 169.0 (7.1) cm (range, 155–180 cm). The main PK parameters for duloxetine after administration of a single oral dose of 30, 60, and 90 mg were as follows: C(max) = 22.46 (15.15), 44.40 (17.18), and 60.78 (27.84) ng/mL, respectively; AUC(0–60) = 328.64 (203.64), 696.04 (337.82), and 1219.33 (598.29) ng/mL. h(-1); AUC(0-infinity)) = 359.68 (201.01), 733.82 (343.40), and 1280.51 (644.81) ng/mL. h(-1); T(max) = 6.83 (1.99), 6.10 (1.29), and 6.60 (1.58) hours; t1/2 = 12.95 (3.64), 12.81 (2.31), and 11.66 (2.06) hours; CL = 107.90 (53.05), 98.41 (41.98), and 109.58 (52.74) L/hour; and V(d) = 2518.88 (1707.71), 1879.74 (999.09), and 1858.47 (1203.69) L. The 10 subjects who received the 30-mg dose in the single-dose phase continued on to the multiple-dose phase and received 30 mg of duloxetine twice daily for 7 days. Mean (SD) values for the main PK parameters for duloxetine after administration of multiple doses were as follows: C(ssmax) = 47.33 (16.95) ng/mL; C(ssmm) = 27.92 (9.46) ng/mL; AUC(ss(0-t)) = 407.25 (125.94) ng/mL. h(-1); C(ssav) = 33.94 (13.00) ng/mL; T(max) = 6.36 (0.92) hours; t(1/2) = 11.19 (1.98) hours; CL = 83.12 (28.75) L/hour; and V(d) = 1359.01 (590.06) L.

Conclusions

In these healthy Chinese subjects, AUC and Cmax increased proportionally with the dose, whereas t(1/2) was independent of the dose. Linear PK properties were found at doses of 30 to 90 mg. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PK parameters for the subjects in the multiple-dose phase (t(1/2), CL, V(d)) and those for subjects in the single-dose phase. The AUC and C(max) were greater after administration of multiple doses than after administration of a single dose, suggesting du-loxetine accumulation with multiple-dose administration of 30 mg.

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appear to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

2.9 Switching a Patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with CYMBALTA. Conversely, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping CYMBALTA before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

2.10 Use of CYMBALTA with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start CYMBALTA in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications (4)].

In some cases, a patient already receiving CYMBALTA therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, CYMBALTA should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 5 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with CYMBALTA may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with CYMBALTA is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Concomitant administration of warfarin (2 to 9 mg once daily) under steady state conditions with duloxetine 60 or 120 mg once daily for up to 14 days in healthy subjects (n = 15) did not significantly change INR from baseline (mean INR changes ranged from 0.05 to +0.07). The total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics (AUCT, ss, Cmax, ssor tmax, ss) for both R- and S-warfarin were not altered by duloxetine. Because of the potential effect of duloxetine on platelets, patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when duloxetine is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

7.5 Lorazepam

Under steady-state conditions for duloxetine (60 mg Q 12 hours) and lorazepam (2 mg Q 12 hours), the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were not affected by co-administration.

### Duloxetine 60 mg once daily dosing versus placebo in the acute treatment of major depression [^112KCzL3]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Existing therapies for major depressive disorder (MDD) have either limited efficacy and/or poor tolerability. The present study examined the effects of duloxetine, a potent and balanced dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), in patients with MDD. Adult patients (N = 267) with MDD were randomly assigned to receive duloxetine (60 mg/day) or placebo in this 9-week, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. Efficacy was evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)), Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), and Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS). Safety was evaluated by assessing discontinuation rates, adverse event rates, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Duloxetine (60 mg QD) significantly reduced the HAMD(17) total score compared with placebo at the end of 9-week therapy. Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 65 and 43%, respectively, for duloxetine compared with 42 and 28% for placebo. Duloxetine also reduced overall pain, back pain, shoulder pain and time in pain while awake significantly more than placebo. Global measures of improvement, including PGI-I and QLDS, were significantly improved by duloxetine compared with placebo. Discontinuations due to adverse events were more frequent for duloxetine-treated patients (12.5%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.3%). Nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation were more frequent for duloxetine than placebo. There was no significant incidence of hypertension, nor any other safety issues. Duloxetine 60 mg administered once daily appears to be a safe and effective treatment for MDD.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same time.

2.2 Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed- release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.

### Duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: safety and tolerability associated with dose escalation [^1169Vdrm]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) at a dose of 60 mg/day (given once daily). Whereas the target dose for the majority of patients is 60 mg/day, higher duloxetine doses (up to 120 mg/day) have been studied using a twice-daily dosing schedule. To further investigate the pharmacological profile of duloxetine within a once-daily dosing regimen at doses above 60 mg, we examined the safety and tolerability of duloxetine during a dose escalation from 60 mg/day to 120 mg/day. This single-arm, non-placebo-controlled study incorporated a 7-week dose escalation phase, in which patients and investigators were blinded as to timing of dose increases, followed by an open-label extension phase of up to 2 years duration. Patients (age ≥ 18 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD (n = 128) received placebo for 1 week, followed by duloxetine (60 mg/day) titrated after 1 week to 90 mg/day, and after a further week to 120 mg/day. The dose of 120 mg/day was then maintained for 4 weeks. The extension phase comprised an initial 6-week dose stabilization period, during which duloxetine was tapered to the lowest effective dose, followed by continuation therapy at the stabilized dose. We assessed safety using spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory analytes, and visual analogue scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and VAS assessments of pain severity and interference. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events during the acute phase of the study was 15.6%. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and decreased appetite. The majority of TEAEs were associated with initial duloxetine dosing; further escalations in dose produced few additional adverse events. VAS measures of GI disturbance worsened significantly compared with baseline values after 1 week of duloxetine treatment. Subsequent assessments of GI disturbance, following dose escalation to 90 mg/day and 120 mg/day, showed either no significant difference or a significant improvement from baseline. Significant improvements (P < .001) were observed in all assessed depression efficacy measures, and in five of six VAS pain outcomes, during acute phase treatment. During 2 years of extension phase therapy, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 11.9%, and the only TEAEs reported by > 10% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection (13.1%), headache (10.7%), and insomnia (10.7%). Mean changes from baseline to the end of the extension phase in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 3.8 and 0.5 mm Hg, respectively, and there were no reports of sustained hypertension. Mean increase in heart rate was 5.9 bpm, while patients exhibited a mean weight increase of 3.1 kg over 2 years of treatment. Results from this study suggest that rapid dose escalation of duloxetine (60 mg/day → 90 mg/day → 120 mg/day) is safe and tolerable. Despite weekly escalation, the majority of adverse events were mild and transient and occurred in the first week of duloxetine dosing (at 60 mg once daily). Long-term treatment at a stabilized duloxetine dose was associated with a relatively low incidence of TEAEs and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Time course profiles of body weight and heart rate showed modest increases during 2 years of treatment [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NC T000 42575].

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with duloxetine delayed-release capsules or within 5 days of stopping treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Starting duloxetine delayed-release capsules in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Concomitant use of an MAOI antidepressant with duloxetine delayed-release capsules are contraindicated
Use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI antidepressant is contraindicated
In linezolid- or intravenous methylene blue-treated patients, initiation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules are contraindicated (4)

### Duloxetine (Duloxetine hydrochloride) [^115AXhqe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In an analysis of data from all placebo-controlled-trials, duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients reported a higher rate of falls compared to placebo-treated patients. The increased risk appears to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including bone fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine after a single dose of 40 mg were compared in healthy elderly females (65 to 77 years) and healthy middle-age females (32 to 50 years). There was no difference in the Cmax, but the AUC of duloxetine was somewhat (about 25%) higher and the half-life about 4 hours longer in the elderly females. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the typical values for clearance decrease by approximately 1% for each year of age between 25 to 75 years of age; but age as a predictive factor only accounts for a small percentage of between-patient variability. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the adult patient is not necessary.

8.6 Gender

Duloxetine's half-life is similar in men and women. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary.

8.7 Smoking Status

Duloxetine bioavailability (AUC) appears to be reduced by about one-third in smokers. Dosage modifications are not recommended for smokers.

8.8 Race

No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race.

8.9 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with clinically evident hepatic impairment have decreased duloxetine metabolism and elimination. After a single 20 mg dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 6 cirrhotic patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) had a mean plasma duloxetine clearance about 15% that of age- and gender-matched healthy subjects, with a 5-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC). Although Cmaxwas similar to normals in the cirrhotic patients, the half-life was about 3 times longer [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

6.1	Clinical Trial Data Sources

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Reactions reported during the studies were not necessarily caused by the therapy, and the frequencies do not reflect investigator impression (assessment) of causality.

Adults — The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine in placebo-controlled trials for MDD (N = 3779), GAD (N = 1018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and another indication (N = 1294). The population studied was 17 to 89 years of age; 65.7%, 60.8%, 60.6%, 42.9%, and 94.4% female; and 81.8%, 72.6%, 85.3%, 74.0%, and 85.7% Caucasian for MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and another indication, respectively. Most patients received doses of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Onset of action for duloxetine 60 mg once daily: double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^116vov8G]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is widely believed that most antidepressant medications exhibit a delay of 2–4 weeks before clinically relevant improvement can be observed among patients. During this latency period, patients continue to be symptomatic and functionally impaired. Thus, time to onset of effect is an important attribute of a new pharmacotherapy. We assessed the onset of effect for duloxetine, utilizing analytical methods previously recommended in the literature.

Method

Efficacy data were pooled from two identical, but independent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 9-week clinical trials of duloxetine (60 mg QD). Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(17)), HAMD(17) subscales (Maier, core, and anxiety), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales. In each individual study, duloxetine demonstrated statistically significant advantages over placebo on multiple outcomes. The present analysis utilized pooled data to more accurately and fully characterize the onset of effect for duloxetine.

Results

Median times to sustained improvements of 10% and 20% in the HAMD(17) total score among duloxetine-treated patients were 14 days and 21 days, respectively, compared with 34 days and 49 days, respectively, for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001 for both results). The median time to sustained 30% improvement in HAMD(17) total score was 35 days for duloxetine-treated patients, while the median time for placebo-treated patients was not estimable since less than half of the patients met this criterion by the end of the trial. For duloxetine-treated patients, median times to sustained 10%, 20%, and 30% improvements on the Maier subscale of the HAMD(17) were the same as those for the HAMD(17) total score: 14, 21, and 35 days, respectively. However, in other analyses, changes in core emotional symptoms as measured by subscales of the HAMD(17) were somewhat faster than changes in overall symptomatology. The probabilities of achieving a sustained 30% improvement (Maier subscale) at Week 1 for duloxetine- and placebo-treated patients were 16.2% vs. 4.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). The corresponding probabilities of sustained improvement at Weeks 2 and 3 for duloxetine were 32.5% and 45.4%, respectively, compared to 12.8% and 21.4% for placebo ((p < 0.001 for both comparisons).

Conclusion

The absence of an active comparator limits the conclusions which can be drawn regarding the rapidity of onset of clinically meaningful improvement. However, results from the present investigation may be useful to clinicians in consideration of treatment options for individual patients.

Concomitant administration of warfarin (2 to 9 mg once daily) under steady state conditions with duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 or 120 mg once daily for up to 14 days in healthy subjects (n = 15) did not significantly change INR from baseline (mean INR changes ranged from 0.05 to +0.07). The total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics (AUCτ, ss, Cmax, ssor tmax, ss) for both R- and S-warfarin were not altered by duloxetine. Because of the potential effect of duloxetine on platelets, patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when duloxetine delayed-release capsules are initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

12. Clinical Pharmacology

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

### Incidence and duration of antidepressant-induced nausea: duloxetine compared with paroxetine and fluoxetine [^1123onPF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This analysis assessed the incidence, severity, onset, and duration of nausea among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with the new antidepressant duloxetine.

Methods

Data were pooled from 8 double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled trials employing patients with MDD that were submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration to support duloxetine's new drug application for treatment of MDD.

Results

The numbers of patients receiving each regimen were as follows: placebo, n = 777; duloxetine 40 mg/d, n = 177; duloxetine 60 mg/d, n = 251; duloxetine 80 mg/d, n = 363; duloxetine 120 mg/d, n = 348; paroxetine 20 mg/d, n = 359; and fluoxetine 20 mg/d, n = 70. In acute placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine 40 to 120 mg/d, treatment-emergent nausea was reported by more duloxetine-treated patients than those receiving placebo (19.9% [227/1139] vs 6.9% [154/777], respectively; P < 0.001). Among duloxetine-treated patients, the median time to onset of nausea was 1 day, and the median duration of nausea was 7 days. The incidence of nausea was similar to placebo rates after 1 week. In paroxetine-controlled studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent nausea in patients receiving duloxetine did not differ significantly from paroxetine (14.4% vs 12.0%, respectively). In head-to-head studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent nausea with duloxetine did not differ significantly from that with fluoxetine (17.1% vs 15.7%, respectively). Most duloxetine-treated patients reported nausea to be mild (52.9%) or moderate (41.4%). Treatment discontinuation secondary to nausea occurred in more duloxetine-treated patients than those receiving placebo (1.4% [16/1139] vs 0.1% [1/777], respectively; P = 0.002). Following abrupt discontinuation after acute treatment, 5.9% of duloxetine-treated patients exhibited nausea compared with 0.3% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The incidence of treatment-emergent nausea during 6-month continuation of duloxetine treatment (80 mg/d, 2.1%; 120 mg/d, 1.3%) was similar to placebo (1.6%). Following abrupt discontinuation after 8 months of treatment, nausea was reported by 1.6% of patients receiving duloxetine 120 mg/d compared with 0% for those receiving duloxetine 80 mg/d and 0% for placebo.

Conclusions

Duloxetine induced mild to moderate nausea in a subset of patients with MDD during treatment initiation. Nausea resolved rapidly with continued treatment. The incidence of duloxetine-induced nausea resembled that produced by paroxetine and fluoxetine.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^112PGQqX]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake.

Objective

This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability.

Methods

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed.

Results

Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine hydrochloride pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. Peak plasma concentration of duloxetine is attained at 5 hours following administration of duloxetine delayed-release capsules. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one- third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of food

Compared to fasted state administration, high-fat, high-calorie meal (containing approximately 150 kcal from protein, 250 kcal from carbohydrates and 500 kcal from fat) did not have a significant effect on Cmaxand AUC of duloxetine hydrochloride. However, Tmaxof duloxetine hydrochloride delayed by approximately 1.7 hours with the administration of high-fat, high-calorie meal.

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules administered under fasting conditions to healthy adults by sprinkling the entire contents on one-tablespoon (15 mL) of applesauce did not significantly affect Tmax, Cmax, and AUC of duloxetine.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

2.9	Use of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications (4)].

In some cases, a patient already receiving Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 5 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2. Dosage and Administration

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same time.

2.2 Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.

2.4 Dosage for Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain in Adults

Administer 60 mg once daily in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. There is no evidence that doses higher than 60 mg once daily confer additional significant benefit and the higher dosage is clearly less well tolerated. For patients for whom tolerability is a concern, a lower starting dose may be considered.

Since diabetes is frequently complicated by renal disease, consider a lower starting dosage and gradual increase in dosage for patients with renal impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.10)].

2.5 Dosage for Treatment of Fibromyalgia

Recommended Dosage in Adults

The recommended duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage is 60 mg once daily in adults with fibromyalgia. Begin treatment at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. Some patients may respond to the starting dosage. There is no evidence that dosages greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg/day dosage, and higher dosages were associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions.

Additional pediatric use information is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (T lag), with maximal plasma concentrations (C max) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the C max of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α 1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

Elimination

Metabolism

Biotransformation and disposition of duloxetine in humans have been determined following oral administration of 14C-labeled duloxetine. Duloxetine comprises about 3% of the total radiolabeled material in the plasma, indicating that it undergoes extensive metabolism to numerous metabolites. The major biotransformation pathways for duloxetine involve oxidation of the naphthyl ring followed by conjugation and further oxidation. Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 catalyze the oxidation of the naphthyl ring in vitro. Metabolites found in plasma include 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate.

### Alternate-day dosing to taper antidepressants risks severe withdrawal effects: an in silico analysis [^1176yG9V]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians often recommend dosing antidepressants every other day when tapering to reduce 'average' daily doses. This is used in place of liquid formulations or other methods for obtaining smaller doses. There is limited evidence to support this approach. This paper explores variation of the inter-dose interval when tapering five widely used antidepressants: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, and mirtazapine. We analysed the resultant occupancy of relevant target receptors to establish whether prolonging the interval between doses would likely increase the risk of withdrawal symptoms.

Design and Methods

Analysis was conducted in silico using pre-existing pharmacokinetic data including bioavailability, distribution volumes, time to maximal concentration, and elimination half-lives. Modelling was conducted to assess the effect of altered administration frequency. Receptor occupancy was predicted using previous imaging data. We used pre-defined thresholds to evaluate the tolerability of receptor occupancy variation for different dosing strategies.

Results

Prolonging the inter-dose interval led to a pronounced increase in receptor occupancy variation at standard doses of all antidepressants. Variation increased as dosage reduced until the ED 50 for each drug, which is often far below doses used in current practice. Therefore, increasing the dose interval at minimum therapeutic doses, or even half of that dose, likely increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms and cannot be recommended as a prudent strategy for tapering.

Conclusion

Dosing every other day is likely to cause withdrawal effects with the antidepressants examined in this study. These recommendations remain theoretical until further clinical research and empirical validation of our proposed antidepressant tapering regimens.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (Duloxetine delayed-release) [^115wJo92]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder — A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of patients who experienced, at least once, one treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Adverse Reactions in Adults

Adult Clinical Trial Database

The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine delayed-release capsules in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N = 3,779), GAD (N = 1,018), OA (N = 503), CLBP (N = 600), DPNP (N = 906), and FM (N = 1,294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients ≥ 65 years old (Study GAD-5) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population.

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

5.11 Increases in Blood Pressure

In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials across the approved adult populations from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment was associated with mean increases of 0.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to mean decreases of 0.6 mm Hg systolic and 0.3 mm Hg diastolic in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of duloxetine delayed-release capsules on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to 200 mg twice daily (approximately 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage). At the highest 200 mg twice daily dose, the increase in mean pulse rate was 5 to 6.8 beats and increases in mean blood pressure were 4.7 to 6.8 mm Hg (systolic) and 4.5 to 7 mm Hg (diastolic) up to 12 hours after dosing.

Blood pressure should be measured prior to initiating treatment and periodically measured throughout treatment [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

### Safety and efficacy of duloxetine in Japanese patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis: an open-label, long-term, phase III extension study [^117HcDa4]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was conducted at 28 medical institutions throughout Japan between January 2015 and March 2016. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each study site (Table S1) and conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.

Study design and treatment protocol

This was a multicenter, long-term, open-label, extension study (: NCT02335346) of a previously conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of duloxetine in Japanese patients with chronic knee pain due to OA (NCT02248480). As described previously, patients in the double-blind trial were randomized (using an interactive Internet-response system and stochastic minimization) 1:1 to placebo or duloxetine (Cymbalta; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) taken orally once daily after breakfast (Figure 1A). The dose of duloxetine was increased from 20 mg/day (1 week) to 40 mg/day (1 week) to the target dose of 60 mg/day (12 weeks). At the end of the 14-week treatment phase, patients entered a 1-week dose-tapering phase. After completing the 1-week dose-tapering phase, patients were invited to participate in this extension study (Figure 1A). There was no washout period before entering the extension. Duloxetine was increased to 60 mg/day over 2 weeks. Patients then received duloxetine 60 mg/day for 48 weeks. After completion of treatment in the extension study (or discontinuation), patients underwent tapering for 2 weeks, followed by an observational phase of 1 week. The use of analgesic medication was not restricted during the extension study. Other allowed and prohibited treatments/interventions were similar to those in the previous study.

### Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (Na) [^113V8DMp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age have not been established.

Fibromyalgia

The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of fibromyalgia in patients less than 13 years of age have not been established.

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of MDD. Efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules was not demonstrated in two 10-week, placebo-controlled trials with 800 pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years old with MDD (MDD-6 and MDD-7). Neither duloxetine delayed-release capsules nor an active control (approved for treatment of pediatric MDD) was superior to placebo.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the MDD pediatric clinical trials included nausea, headache, decreased weight, and abdominal pain. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs and SNRIs.

Juvenile Animal Toxicology Data

Duloxetine administration to young rats from post-natal day 21 (weaning) through post-natal day 90 (adult) resulted in decreased body weights that persisted into adulthood, but recovered when drug treatment was discontinued; slightly delayed (~1.5 days) sexual maturation in females, without any effect on fertility; and a delay in learning a complex task in adulthood, which was not observed after drug treatment was discontinued. These effects were observed at the high dose of 45 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD, for a child); the no-effect-level was 20 mg/kg/day (≈1 times the MRHD, for a child).

Additional pediatric use information is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride [^113Vw2Jg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine after a single dose of 40 mg were compared in healthy elderly females (65 to 77 years) and healthy middle-age females (32 to 50 years). There was no difference in the Cmax, but the AUC of duloxetine was somewhat (about 25%) higher and the half-life about 4 hours longer in the elderly females. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the typical values for clearance decrease by approximately 1% for each year of age between 25 to 75 years of age; but age as a predictive factor only accounts for a small percentage of between-patient variability. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the adult patient is not necessary.

8.6 Gender

Dulexatine's half-life is similar in men and women. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary.

8.7 Smoking Status

Duloxetine bioavailability (AUC) appears to be reduced by about one-third in smokers. Dosage modifications are not recommended for smokers.

8.8 Race

No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race.

8.9 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with clinically evident hepatic impairment have decreased duloxetine metabolism and elimination. After a single 20 mg dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules, 6 cirrhotic patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) had a mean plasma duloxetine clearance about 15% that of age- and gender-matched healthy subjects, with a 5-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC). Although Cmaxwas similar to normals in the cirrhotic patients, the half-life was about 3 times longer [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine is in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food:

Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1,640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.

Research content and methods

(1) We will compare the starting time and effectiveness rate of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets vs. placebo for the reduction of cough symptoms and somatic symptoms in patients with refractory cough. We will also observe whether duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets can relieve or control cough symptoms in patients. (2) After discontinuation of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets, the change pattern and effectiveness rate against cough and somatic symptoms of the two groups of patients will be compared, and will determined whether there is a continuation effect of duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets after drug discontinuation.

(3) We will compare the changes on the objective cough frequency, cough visual analog scale (VAS), cough symptom score, Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), cough evaluation test (CET), capsaicin cough sensitivity, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), Life Events Scale (LES-32), and induced sputum supernatant at each time point to explore whether duloxetine acid enteric-coated tablets further improve the quality of life and cough sensitivity of patients with refractory cough.

(4) We will compare the drop-out rate and the completion rate of the treatment course in the two groups of patients to determine whether duloxetine hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets can improve the treatment adherence and success rate of patients.

The first stage is a screening period of up to 3 days and a lead-in period of up to 4 days. The subjects who sign the informed consent form (ICF) will screened, and the qualified subjects will enter the lead-in period. The second stage runs from baseline to the 42nd (last) day of treatment, with follow-up visits on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, and 42nd days to observe the efficacy and safety of the test drugs. The third stage is the follow-up 1 week after treatment ends.

In all 3 studies, Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (Studies 1–3 in Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities.

In another study, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment (defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement [CGI-Improvement] score of 1 or 2) were randomly assigned to continuation of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules at the same dose (N = 216) or to placebo (N = 213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score ≥ 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (Study 4 in Figure 2).

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.

Pediatric use information for patients ages 7 to 17 years is approved for Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s CYMBALTA® (duloxetine) delayed-release capsules. However, due to Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride [^114SkjcA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with MAOI antidepressants is contraindicated. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.9, 2.10) and CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

If concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

### Duloxetine: a review of its pharmacology and use in chronic pain management [^11682viH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that possesses antidepressant and pain-relieving properties. Compared with other antidepressants, it has a high affinity for both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake transporters, which are relatively balanced. Analgesic onset has been observed within the first week of administration in randomized controlled trials and is likely obtained by enhancing the tone of the descending pain inhibition pathways of the central nervous system. Randomized trials have documented significant analgesic effects for managing chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Studies have also suggested that pain associated with major depressive disorder can be reduced with this medication. Modest effects for headache, osteoarthritic pain, and pain secondary to Parkinson disease have also been documented, but data are obtained from single-blinded or open-label trials that require further corroboration with larger randomized studies. Duloxetine has not yet been directly compared with other antidepressants or anticonvulsants for the treatment of pain syndromes.

### Duloxetine in the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder [^111JXGHM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a chronic recurring disorder and guidelines recommend long-term therapy. This clinical trial evaluated the long-term (1 year) safety and efficacy of duloxetine, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, in patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder.

Method

This was an open-label, 52-week, multinational clinical trial in outpatients (age ≥ 18 years) who received duloxetine at 80 mg/day (administered 40 mg twice daily) to 120 mg/day (administered 60 mg twice daily) for up to 1 year.

Results

A total of 1279 patients had postbaseline data. Of these, 520 were exposed to duloxetine for at least 360 days, yielding approximately 808 patient-years of total exposure. Mean changes in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score and subfactor scores, Beck Depression Inventory-II score, and Sheehan Disability Scale score and mean Patient Global Impression-Improvement scale (PGI-I) scores all showed highly significant (p < .001) improvements at all assessment times. The estimated probabilities of improvement in CGI-S and PGI-I scores at week 1 were 40.4% and 59.2%, respectively, and at week 2 were 70.0% and 78.3%. The estimated probabilities of remission at weeks 6, 28, and 52 were 50.8%, 75.6%, and 81.8%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 218 patients (17.0%). The most frequent specific events leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.5%), somnolence (1.4%), vomiting (0.9%), hypomania (0.8%), pregnancy (0.8%), dizziness (0.6%), insomnia (0.6%), and hypertension (0.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported by > 10% of patients included nausea, insomnia, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, sweating increase, anxiety, diarrhea, and fatigue. Most events occurred early in the study. Of those events that first occurred or worsened after discontinuation, only dizziness (8.3%) occurred in more than 5% of patients. Mean changes from baseline to last observation for standing and supine pulse were less than 2 b.p.m. Mean changes in blood pressure (< 1.0 mm Hg), corrected QT interval (< 1 msec), and body weight (2.4 kg [5.3 lb]) were not clinically significant. Laboratory analyses varied across visits, and mean changes after 52 weeks were generally close to zero. The incidence of laboratory values above or below normal limits at any time during treatment was low.

Conclusion

Duloxetine was effective, safe, and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of major depression at a dose of 80 to 120 mg/day in this study.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^1138FM2G]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

It is important to consider all of the safety findings described here in light of the dosing and design requirements of the study. The doses used in this open-label study were up to 2-fold greater than the once-daily 60 mg duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy in older patients in placebo-controlled trials. The dosing and other design features of the study (e.g. the intensive visit schedule) were specifically included to maximize the probability of uncovering adverse reactions to duloxetine. Furthermore, no special dosing guidelines were implemented for these elderly patients. While lower doses of many antidepressants are recommended in the elderly, especially due to concerns of adverse events among the TCAs, this can lead to the use of subtherapeutic doses and corresponding reductions in efficacy. In this study, however, the comparable adverse event profiles observed for elderly and younger age groups suggest that a duloxetine dose which has been shown to provide robust efficacy may be safely administered in depressed patients regardless of age. Only in particularly sensitive elderly patients may dosing adjustments be required.

### Duloxetine: a dual reuptake inhibitor [^115V3k7P]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Data Sources

Searches using MEDLINE and PsycINFO were conducted (1966 to November 2003).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All duloxetine MDD information gathered was considered. Articles containing comprehensive information regarding duloxetine use for MDD were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor being considered for treatment of MDD and stress urinary incontinence. While approved dosing ranges have not yet been determined, studies support the efficacy and safety of 40–60 mg twice daily for the treatment of acute MDD. Adverse effects have been of mild to moderate severity and are considered to be transient. Cardiovascular effects (increased heart rate or blood pressure), while present, do not appear to be clinically significant. Overall, duloxetine appears to be well tolerated.

Conclusions

Duloxetine is a safe and effective antidepressant. Approval of this agent provides another treatment option for the management of MDD.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^116p17S2]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, observed case response and remission rates following 6 weeks of open-label duloxetine therapy (62.9% and 41.4%, respectively) were comparable to the response and remission rates (52.8% and 44.1%, respectively) observed in older patients in two 9-week double-blind, placebo controlled trials of duloxetine (60 mg QD). Furthermore, remission rates at 52 weeks in the present study were only slightly less than response rates (72.3% and 89.4%, respectively), implying that those patients who responded had a high probability of achieving complete symptom resolution. A growing body of evidence suggests that remission, rather than response, should be the goal of antidepressant treatment. Responders who do not remit may have appreciable residual symptomatology, and patients with residual symptoms have been found to be at higher risk for relapse or recurrence. Given the high rates of relapse and recurrence observed among elderly patients, achievement of remission assumes an added degree of importance.

In light of the recommendation that elderly patients receive at least 12–18 months of antidepressant therapy, the long-term safety and tolerability of these medications are of considerable importance. Duloxetine was safely administered and well-tolerated in this long-term study. While the discontinuation rate due to adverse events (26.7%) was somewhat higher than that observed in older patients (aged ≥ 55) in two 9-week, placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine 60 mg QD (21.0%), the difference in these rates suggests that few patients stopped taking medication during the periods associated with continuation and maintenance treatment. The discontinuation rate is also comparable to that observed in a 54-week study of fluoxetine in elderly patients, and is only slightly higher than that obtained from a meta-analysis of acute-phase (≤ 8 week) trials of SSRIs in elderly patients (14.3%–22.8%). Given the one-year duration of this study, and the administration of duloxetine at the upper end of its studied dose range (80–120 mg/d) throughout the trial, the long-term tolerability of duloxetine in elderly patients appears to be comparable to that of SSRIs.

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that is described in the sleep disturbances section, which can also be an effective option for acute anxiety or for chronic anxiety. For acute use, on an as-needed basis, 10 mg is an appropriate starting dose and can be given up to 3 times per day. For chronic anxiety, 10 mg twice daily is an appropriate starting dose, and this can be increased by 10 mg per day until an effective dose is reached or until the maximum daily dose is reached. The recommended maximum daily dose for patients younger than six years is 25 mg up to 2 times/day. The recommended maximum daily dose for patients between 6–12 years is 25 mg up to 4 times/day. For patients 12 years and older, the recommended maximum daily dose is 50 mg up to 4 times/day. As noted previously, the safety of long-term use of antihistamines in young children has yet to be studied, and thus, hydroxyzine is not recommended for long-term use for young children.

Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is FDA-approved for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in non-autistic adults and GAD in non-autistic children, adolescents and adults. Currently, there are no published RCTs evaluating the use of duloxetine in the ASD population. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line option for co-occurring anxiety and depression and as a second-line option for anxiety alone. Side effects of duloxetine may include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, sexual impairments, constipation, reduced appetite, diarrhea, low blood sodium (hyponatremia), and, more rarely, risk of induction of hypomania, lowered seizure threshold, and suicidal ideation. Duloxetine is available in capsules of 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg and must be swallowed whole. The recommended starting dosage is 20 mg/day, and this can be increased by 10 mg every 1–2 weeks to reach a target dosage between 20–90 mg a day in 1–2 divided dosages.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsule orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsule is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsule at the same time.

2.2 Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.

Prohibited concomitant medication

We will try to avoid combining drugs as much as possible, especially combining medications that have a strong impact on the judgment of the trial results (effectiveness and safety). However, in case of AE, deterioration of the original condition, or complication/new onset of other serious diseases during the trial, the investigator should promptly combine the drugs and actively carry out rescue treatment. If the subject meets the withdrawal criteria, the investigator should make proper arrangements for the subject to withdraw from the trial. All the concomitant medication (including prescription and over-the-counter medications) should be recorded in the case record form (CRF) during the trial, including details of drug name, single dose, frequency of administration, routine of administration, reason for administration, start and end time of administration, etc. If the dosage of concomitant medication changes, it should also be recorded in the CRF. In particular, the combined drug use in the event of an AE should be recorded and reported in a timely way.

Subject elimination criteria

Subjects can voluntarily withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason, and the investigator can also suspend any subject from participating in the trial for various reasons (mainly including safety issues or breach of protocol). Subjects who have one of the following circumstances shall withdraw from the trial or be deemed to have withdrawn from the trial:
① The subjects stopped taking the drug on their own and were unwilling to continue the trial due to poor efficacy or ineffectiveness;
② Subjects withdraw their ICF and voluntarily withdraw from the trial;
③ Subjects are lost to follow-up.

SAE or more severe allergic reactions:

① The subjects are not allowed to continue using the experimental drugs if the investigator and/or monitor thinks it is unsafe and unethical. This is because of the significant abnormalities in safety-related laboratory indicators, the occurrence of SAEs, or more severe allergic reactions associated with the study drug;
② The patient goes blind due to SAEs or needs to be resuscitated immediately;
③ The patient gets pregnant during the trial;
④ It is inappropriate for the patient to continue participating in the trial due to the worsening of the original disease or lack of tolerance during the trial;
⑤ If the trial results in complications or the onset of new serious illnesses, such as tuberculosis or tumors, the investigator will deem it necessary to discontinue the trial.

If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules at the same time.

2.1	Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder

Administer Duloxetine Delayed-release Capsules at a total dose of 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. The safety of doses above 120 mg/day has not been adequately evaluated. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Duloxetine is in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of duloxetine 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.

Absorption

After oral duloxetine administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (Tlag), with maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.

Effect of Food: Food does not affect the Cmaxof duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (> 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.
