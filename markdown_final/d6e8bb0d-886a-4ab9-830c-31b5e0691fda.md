## Question

What dose of steroids to order for pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what dose of corticosteroids to order for pneumonia, including considerations of dose selection, duration, agent choice, monitoring, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define severe versus non-severe CAP and confirm the guideline stance. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and any conflicting recommendations. Next, I will examine dosing ranges, duration, and steroid selection, including any dose–response signals. After that, I need to check safety trade-offs and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like COVID-19, influenza, immunocompromised hosts, and pediatrics, and close with a practical, risk-stratified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definitions, because dosing hinges on severity and guideline posture. Severe CAP is typically defined by ICU admission, ATS/IDSA severe criteria, PSI risk class IV–V, or PaO2/FiO2 less than 300, whereas non-severe CAP refers to hospitalized patients not meeting those thresholds, and this stratification drives whether adjunctive corticosteroids are recommended or discouraged [^115mMXga] [^111dc96E] [^112UU4qH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the guideline consensus before discussing doses. The 2024 SCCM/ESICM focused update issues a strong recommendation to administer corticosteroids for adult inpatients with severe bacterial CAP, while making no recommendation for less severe CAP, reflecting a credible subgroup effect whereby benefits concentrate in severe disease, largely informed by the CAPE COD RCT showing mortality reduction [^116LeFzN] [^111dc96E] [^116Hmoeb]. In contrast, the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline advised against routine corticosteroids in both non-severe and severe CAP, citing potential harms and uncertain benefit, so there is a historical conflict that clinicians must reconcile with newer data and local policy [^115mMXga] [^116p3gaD]. The 2025 ATS update moves toward considering steroids in severe CAP, aligning more closely with SCCM, but I should confirm local adoption of this newer guidance before defaulting to it [^116arY2y].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary backbone quantifying benefit in severe CAP. Contemporary meta-analyses show that corticosteroids probably reduce mortality in severe CAP, with pooled relative risk around 0.62–0.82 and consistent reductions in invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU admission, whereas no clear mortality benefit is seen in less severe CAP, reinforcing a severity-dependent effect [^1136GLTA] [^111QpFWJ] [^111GQZsG]. I should double-check that these analyses exclude viral etiologies like COVID-19 when discussing bacterial CAP, because viral pneumonia has a different risk–benefit profile and should not be conflated with bacterial CAP data [^111GQZsG].

> Next, I should review dosing ranges and duration, and I need to ensure I anchor to guideline-concordant regimens. The SCCM 2024 update advises 5–7 days of systemic corticosteroids at a daily dose less than 400 mg hydrocortisone equivalent, with typical practice using 40–80 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent for 5–7 days, and some protocols include a taper if treatment extends beyond a week, though evidence does not mandate a specific taper strategy [^112nc1MD] [^115RaUSV]. Let me consider dose–response signals: a dose–response meta-analysis suggested an optimal dexamethasone dose around 6 mg/day for about 7 days in more severe CAP, but I should caution that this is exploratory and not a substitute for guideline ranges, so it can inform agent selection rather than dictate a universal dose [^1136GLTA].

> I will now examine agent selection, and I should confirm whether hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or prednisolone are preferred. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses and network meta-analyses suggest hydrocortisone may confer the most consistent mortality benefit in severe CAP, with low-to-moderate doses and short courses appearing advantageous, though head-to-head RCTs are limited and certainty varies, so this remains a probabilistic, not absolute, preference [^11744VaY] [^115c9t2v] [^111PsGUe]. Practically, hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/day in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days is reasonable, with methylprednisolone 40 mg/day as an accepted alternative when hydrocortisone is not available or mineralocorticoid activity is undesirable, and dexamethasone 6–8 mg/day can be considered where long half-life and oral bioavailability are advantageous, acknowledging the lower certainty for dexamethasone in bacterial CAP compared with hydrocortisone [^115RaUSV] [^112nc1MD] [^1136GLTA].

> But wait, what about safety and monitoring; I need to ensure the risk–benefit remains favorable at the bedside. The most consistent adverse effect is hyperglycemia requiring insulin, with relative risk around 1.3–1.8 across meta-analyses, so strict glucose monitoring every 6 hours and protocolized insulin are prudent during therapy, especially in patients with diabetes or high inflammatory burden [^111QpFWJ]. Secondary infections are variably reported and, in pooled analyses, do not consistently increase, but vigilance for hospital-acquired infection remains essential, and clinicians should reassess daily for clinical deterioration that might signal infection or steroid-related complications [^111QpFWJ]. I should confirm that the net clinical benefit in severe CAP outweighs these risks, which the guideline panels judged to be the case given mortality and ventilation benefits, while acknowledging uncertainty in less severe disease [^116LeFzN] [^116Hmoeb].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. For COVID-19 pneumonia, dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days is standard and supported by multiple guidelines and RCTs, but this viral-specific regimen should not be extrapolated to non-COVID bacterial CAP without caution, even though some clinicians adapt dosing schemas across etiologies [^111PiJKB] [^114PoSyP]. For influenza pneumonia, guidelines recommend avoiding routine corticosteroids due to potential harm, so steroids should be reserved for refractory shock or other compelling indications rather than used broadly [^1124DMY3]. In immunocompromised hosts, the infectious risk calculus shifts, and although some ILD or PCP scenarios benefit from steroids, routine use in CAP is not supported; if considered, use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration with close surveillance for secondary infections, including fungal disease [^111DXWgS]. In pediatrics, evidence is insufficient for routine corticosteroids in CAP, so I should avoid extrapolating adult regimens to children outside of research or exceptional circumstances [^112yQ37o].

> I should double-check timing and duration nuances, because late initiation may blunt benefit. Most trials and guidelines converge on early initiation within the first 24–72 hours of recognition of severe CAP, and durations of 5–7 days are typical, with some protocols extending to 8–14 days guided by clinical response, though evidence for extended courses beyond 7 days is limited and should be individualized with a low threshold to stop if the clinical trajectory is unfavorable [^112nc1MD]. Hold on, I should verify that prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone in severe CAP did not show mortality benefit in a large VA RCT, reinforcing that longer is not necessarily better and that regimen choice matters, which aligns with the preference for short-course hydrocortisone in severe bacterial CAP when steroids are used [^112JDFqr].

> Next, I should review practical implementation and stopping rules, and I need to ensure the plan is actionable. Start hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/day IV in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days in adults with severe bacterial CAP who are not improving despite antibiotics and supportive care, or use methylprednisolone 40 mg/day IV for 5–7 days if hydrocortisone is unavailable, and consider dexamethasone 6–8 mg/day when oral therapy is acceptable and mineralocorticoid effects are undesirable, while monitoring glucose every 6 hours and reassessing daily for clinical stability and infection control [^115RaUSV] [^112nc1MD]. Stop corticosteroids at 5–7 days if the patient is clinically stable, afebrile, off vasopressors, and improving oxygenation, and consider a brief taper only if the course exceeded 7 days or if adrenal suppression is a concern, recognizing that tapering is not mandated by high-quality evidence in this context [^112nc1MD].

> Finally, I should synthesize a bottom line and make sure it aligns with the highest-quality guidance. For adult inpatients with severe bacterial CAP, a short course of low-to-moderate dose systemic corticosteroids, preferably hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/day for 5–7 days, is reasonable and guideline-supported given probable mortality and ventilation benefits, provided there is close monitoring for hyperglycemia and infection. For non-severe CAP, routine corticosteroids are not recommended due to uncertain benefit and potential harms, so antibiotics and supportive care remain the cornerstone, with steroids reserved for refractory shock or other exceptional indications after multidisciplinary review [^116LeFzN] [^111dc96E] [^115mMXga].

---

For severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), use **methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 12 hours** [^112nc1MD] or **dexamethasone 8 mg IV/PO daily** [^1136GLTA] for 5–7 days [^115RaUSV]. For non-severe CAP, **do not routinely use corticosteroids** [^115mMXga] [^111VKdcB]. Monitor for hyperglycemia [^111QpFWJ] and secondary infections [^111Tb4BV], and avoid steroids in influenza [^1124DMY3] or viral pneumonia unless shock is present [^notfound].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid use in pneumonia

Corticosteroids are **not routinely recommended** for all pneumonia patients [^113mZio5]. Their use is primarily indicated in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**: Defined by ICU admission, severe respiratory failure, or high mortality risk [^114LaX6J].
- **Septic shock**: Particularly when associated with severe CAP [^112Jy62P] [^116BwYep].
- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Especially in critically ill patients [^114Gnwzn] [^111q5Y1S].

---

## Recommended corticosteroid regimens

Several corticosteroid regimens have been studied, with **methylprednisolone and dexamethasone** being the most commonly used agents [^notfound]. The following regimens are supported by current evidence and guidelines:

| **Corticosteroid** | **Dosage and duration** | **Clinical scenario** |
|-|-|-|
| Methylprednisolone | 40 mg IV every 12 hours (total 80 mg/day) for 5–7 days [^112nc1MD] | Severe CAP, septic shock, ARDS [^113R7BZM] |
| Dexamethasone | 8 mg IV or orally once daily for 5–7 days [^notfound] | Severe CAP, septic shock, ARDS [^113R7BZM] |
| Hydrocortisone | 200–300 mg/day IV in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days [^116BwYep] | Severe CAP, septic shock, ARDS [^113R7BZM] |

---

These regimens are **supported by recent guidelines** and meta-analyses demonstrating reduced mortality, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and shorter hospital stay in severe CAP patients [^114LaX6J] [^1136GLTA] [^111GQZsG].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting corticosteroid use

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have evaluated the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in pneumonia:

- **CAPE COD trial**: Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for 7 days reduced 28-day mortality in severe CAP [^116Hmoeb].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show reduced mortality, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and shorter hospital stay in severe CAP [^1136GLTA] [^111GQZsG].
- **Non-severe CAP**: No significant mortality benefit observed, and routine use is not recommended [^115mMXga] [^111VKdcB].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While corticosteroids offer significant benefits in severe CAP, they are associated with **potential risks and adverse effects**, including:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Commonly observed and may require insulin therapy [^111Tb4BV] [^116K73ZA].
- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of infections, including fungal and bacterial infections [^113mZio5] [^1129oQWf].
- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, and mood disturbances [^112R2TWa].
- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Rare but possible, particularly in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing corticosteroid dosing

Several patient-specific factors should be considered when determining corticosteroid dosing:

- **Severity of illness**: Higher doses are indicated in severe CAP, septic shock, or ARDS [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, immunosuppression, and chronic lung disease may influence dosing and monitoring [^113crMig] [^1129oQWf].
- **Age**: Elderly patients may require careful monitoring due to increased risk of adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Renal and hepatic function**: Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired organ function [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on corticosteroid use in pneumonia:

- **Severe CAP**: Strong recommendation for corticosteroid use, with typical regimens including methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 12 hours or dexamethasone 8 mg daily for 5–7 days [^116LeFzN] [^112nc1MD].
- **Non-severe CAP**: Routine corticosteroid use is not recommended due to lack of significant benefit and potential risks [^115mMXga] [^111VKdcB].
- **Septic shock or ARDS**: Conditional recommendation for corticosteroid use, with careful monitoring of adverse effects [^114Gnwzn] [^116BwYep].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Corticosteroids are **beneficial in severe CAP**, septic shock, and ARDS, with recommended regimens including methylprednisolone 40 mg IV every 12 hours or dexamethasone 8 mg daily for 5–7 days. Routine use in non-severe CAP is not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential risks. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors and monitor for adverse effects during therapy [^113R7BZM] [^1136GLTA] [^115mMXga].

Rationale

New evidence is available examining the use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline on critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency.

Objectives

To develop evidence-based recommendations for use of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults and children with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

Panel Design

The 22-member panel included diverse representation from medicine, including adult and pediatric intensivists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinician-methodologists with expertise in developing evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines. We followed Society of Critical Care Medicine conflict of interest policies in all phases of the guideline development, including task force selection and voting.

Methods

After development of five focused Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) questions, we conducted systematic reviews to identify the best available evidence addressing each question. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and formulated recommendations using the evidence-to-decision framework.

Results

In response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing the use of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP. These included a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock. In response to the final PICO regarding type of corticosteroid molecule in ARDS, the panel was unable to provide specific recommendations addressing corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy, based on currently available evidence.

Conclusions

The panel provided updated recommendations based on current evidence to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders on the use of corticosteroids for sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

### Corticosteroids in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: a systematic review, pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis [^1136GLTA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines provide heterogenous guidance on use of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials examining corticosteroids in hospitalized adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed a pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology and the credibility of subgroups using the ICEMAN tool.

Results

We identified 18 eligible studies that included 4661 patients. Corticosteroids probably reduce mortality in more severe CAP (RR 0.62 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.85]; moderate certainty) with possibly no effect in less severe CAP (RR 1.08 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.42]; low certainty). We found a non-linear dose-response relationship between corticosteroids and mortality, suggesting an optimal dose of approximately 6 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) for a duration of therapy of 7 days (RR 0.44 [95% 0.30 to 0.66]). Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42 to 74] and probably reduce intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.97]) (both moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of hospitalization and ICU stay (both low certainty). Corticosteroids may increase the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.76 [95% CI 1.46 to 2.14]) (low certainty).

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids reduce mortality in patients with more severe CAP, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission.

Sepsis — In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, the panel noted benefit regardless of dose and did not name a specific agent or regimen; commonly used regimens included IV hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/d in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days, with some studies adding fludrocortisone 50 μg enterally daily, while historical high-dose/short-duration regimens (over 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent for less than 3 days) are not supported due to adverse effects; if sepsis presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia or with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the panel states to administer corticosteroids as per those respective recommendations, and no specific recommendations on fludrocortisone use were made.

### Hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia: association with the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. A nation-wide cohort study of 52 100 outpatients [^115wrbUy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

International guidelines only advocate the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experiencing recurring exacerbations and eosinophilic inflammation. However, ICSs are commonly used in patients with COPD and without exacerbations and signs of eosinophilic inflammation, thus possibly increasing the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. Thus, we aimed to determine the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia associated with increasing cumulated ICS doses among patients with COPD to establish whether there is dose dependency.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included all patients with COPD treated at a respiratory outpatient clinic in Denmark. The patients were divided into four groups based on their average daily ICS exposure. The dose-response relationship was investigated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.

Results

In total, 52 100 patients were included, who were divided into the no-use (n = 15 755), low-dose (n = 12 050), moderate-dose (n = 12 488), and high-dose (n = 11 807) groups. ICS use was strongly associated with hospitalization for pneumonia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; CI, 1.2–1.3) (ICS vs. no ICS). The risk of hospitalization for pneumonia increased with every dosing group step: low dose: HR, 1.1 (CI, 1.0–1.2); moderate dose: HR, 1.2 (CI, 1.1–1.3), and high dose: HR, 1.5 (CI, 1.4–1.6); "no use" was the reference. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.

Conclusions

In the dose-response relationship analysis, ICS dose were associated with a substantially increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia of up to 50%. Our data support that ICSs should be administered at the lowest possible dose and only to patients with COPD who have a documented need.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114N7xbL]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and can result in significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic medical conditions. Despite developments in antimicrobial therapy and life-support measures for patients with sCAP, clinical outcomes have not improved significantly owing to an aging population, increased prevalence of comorbidities, and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant organisms. Therefore, the prevention and effective management of sCAP continue to be critical public health concerns.

In addition to early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the use of corticosteroids for the management of sCAP has been discussed in considerable detail. As numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the role of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of sCAP and yielded inconsistent findings, current guidelines provide different recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with sCAP. Furthermore, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with CAP; however, not all studies included in these meta-analyses focused on sCAP, and no consistent findings have been reported. In 2023, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that among patients with sCAP treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), treatment with hydrocortisone could result in a lower risk of 28-day mortality than those treated by a placebo. To address this controversy, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in patients with sCAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115mMXga]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Inpatient setting — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and corticosteroids: We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with nonsevere CAP (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe influenza pneumonia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in patients with CAP and refractory septic shock. Risk considerations note that the risk of corticosteroids in the dose range up to 240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent per day for a maximum of 7 days is predominantly hyperglycemia, with concerns about greater complications in the following 30 to 90 days.

### Efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PXrYy]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, an optimal treatment approach for patients with sCAP has not yet been fully established. Subgroup analysis in this study showed that a single maintenance dose notably reduced mortality among older adult patients with sCAP. In contrast, meta-analyses in adults suggested the benefit of a loading dose followed by maintenance therapy. Previous meta-analyses revealed no significant differences in outcomes based on daily corticosteroid doses when 200 mg/day was used as the threshold. Comparing the daily doses because of the variability in hormone types and dosages was challenging. Therefore, we analyzed the differences between various corticosteroids by normalizing their total doses to hydrocortisone-equivalent values. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a lower total corticosteroid dose (≤ 1,750 mg) is significantly associated with reduced mortality. Additionally, the duration of corticosteroid use appeared to be a critical factor affecting efficacy, which is consistent with previous findings in adult meta-analyses. The timing of drug administration has also emerged as a key determinant of drug efficacy. Unlike previous meta-analyses in adults, which used a 5-day threshold, we discovered that short-term corticosteroid use (≤ 7 days) was associated with reduced mortality. These discrepancies may reflect differences between the older adult and adult patient populations. Moreover, subgroup analysis showed that hydrocortisone treatment was associated with improved survival, which is consistent with the findings of an adult meta-analysis. Owing to data limitations, the optimal dose and duration of treatment remain unclear.

The safety of corticosteroids in older adult patients remains a critical concern in the clinical practice. Given the limited data on adverse events associated with corticosteroid use in older adult patients with sCAP, we conducted a meta-analysis that focused on secondary infections, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal injury. Our findings demonstrated no significant increase in the risk of these adverse events. The supporting evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality; Our findings align with previous studies in adult sCAP cohorts. However, due to data constraints, this study did not assess the incidence of hyperglycemia in older adult patients with sCAP. While previous meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroid use does not increase the incidence of hyperglycemia in adult populations, further research is necessary to evaluate this effect, specifically in older adult patients. Although this study confirmed that the risk of adverse events investigated did not show a significant increase, the statistical power may be insufficient due to the heterogeneity in the definitions of adverse events across studies, limited sample size, and low-quality evidence. As a result, rare adverse events may not be reliably detected, and the safety outcomes remain uncertain.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^113WSa3S]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids on the outcomes of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and CINAHL search (1966 to November 2007) to identify full-text publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids in CAP.

Results

An initial literature search yielded 109 articles, and 105 studies were excluded after the first analysis. We found four studies eligible for analysis. On the basis of their results, the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP should be categorized as a weak recommendation (two studies) and a strong recommendation (two studies) with either low- or moderate-quality evidence. However, no evidence of adverse outcomes or harm is present in the evaluated studies.

Conclusion

According to the GRADE system, available studies do not support the recommendation of corticosteroids as a standard of care for patients with severe CAP. Further randomized controlled trials with this aim should enroll a larger number of severely ill patients. However, in patients needing corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to conclude that corticosteroid administration is safe in patients with severe infections receiving antimicrobial therapy.

### What is the best antimicrobial treatment for severe community-acquired pneumonia (including the role of steroids and statins and other immunomodulatory agents) [^113W3HqP]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. The mortality rate due to severe CAP has shown little improvement over the past few years, with a rate as high as 50% mainly in patients admitted to intensive care units. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Several therapies have been tested in patients with severe CAP in recent years. This article reviews recent data regarding different treatments including antimicrobials and adjunctive therapies in patients with severe CAP.

### What is the role of steroids in pneumonia therapy? [^113mZio5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates the potential benefits as well as adverse effects from adjunctive therapy with systemic steroids in patients with pneumonia: either mild-to-moderate or severe, community-acquired or hospital-acquired, of bacterial or of viral origin (in particular H1N1 viral infection).

Recent Findings

Steroids potentially modulate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system in pneumonia. However, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies have repeatedly shown that steroids had no impact on survival, the clinical event of interest, but in severe pneumonia some studies pointed to potential harmful effect. In addition, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections, as well as increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the steroid-treated patients.

Summary

According to the current evidence, there are no data to support the well tolerated use of systemic steroids as a standard of care in pneumonia, neither in mild-to-moderate and severe, nor in bacterial and viral infection. Clinical and basic research should work together to improve trial designs to identify reliable surrogate markers of outcome, in particular of mortality. This may improve the patient selection and facilitate the identification of subgroups that can benefit from adjunctive steroid therapy.

Background

The debate about the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a longstanding dilemma. We performed a meta-analysis including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe CAP in adults.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished clinical trials. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane (from their establishment to July 2013), were searched for relevant articles. Only RCTs of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with severe CAP were selected.

Results

Four trials enrolling 264 patients with severe CAP were included. Use of corticosteroids significantly reduced hospital mortality compared with conventional therapy and placebo (Peto odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.90). The quality of the evidence underlying the pooled estimate of effect on hospital mortality was low, downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision.

Conclusions

On the basis of the current limited evidence, we suggest that, although corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of adult patients with severe CAP, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the instability of pooled estimates. Reliable treatment recommendations will be raised only when large sufficiently powered multi-center RCTs are conducted.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111PsGUe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 2042 patients with severe CAP, we aimed to determine the optimal corticosteroid regimen. Hydrocortisone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). While this finding is statistically significant, its clinical relevance requires further consideration. Traditionally, overreliance on p-values and SUCRA rankings may lead to overlooking the practical implications of therapeutic interventions in clinical settings. SUCRA values reflect relative rankings rather than absolute clinical benefit and should be interpreted with caution. To address these, Horita et al. recently proposed a framework for the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which is applicable to effect sizes such as RR. According to this framework, an RR of 0.35 is not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful, demonstrating a substantial mortality benefit. Further comparative analysis suggested that hydrocortisone may outperform methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone in reducing mortality. Additionally, our results indicate that patients may benefit more from corticosteroids administered in low-to-moderate doses and over short courses.

Previous direct meta-analyses have investigated the effect of corticosteroids on severe CAP, but the results remain inconclusive. Our network meta-analysis revealed that unlike other corticosteroids, hydrocortisone not only significantly reduced mortality, but also reduced the need for MV. These findings underscore the distinct advantages of hydrocortisone in improving patient prognosis. Importantly, owing to the absence of direct comparative RCTs between different corticosteroids, our analysis provides critical insights suggesting that hydrocortisone may be more effective in reducing mortality and MV. Evidence credibility was rated as very low to low for outcomes including all-cause mortality, MV, and SAEs, primarily due to concerns regarding incoherence, heterogeneity, and imprecision. These limitations warrant cautious interpretation of hydrocortisone's potential benefits and highlight the need for well-designed, adequately powered head-to-head RCTs to validate these findings.

Conclusions

Among patients with severe CAP, treatment with a 7-day fixed-duration course of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, appears unlikely to yield a large reduction in mortality. Smaller benefits and possible harm are not excluded.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117D6Hou]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results provided by this double-blind, randomised trial of CAP patients admitted to a general hospital ward and presenting severe respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations support the hypothesis that an adjuvant steroid therapy decreases the inflammatory response, and seems to reduce the need for MV. This experience supports the need for larger studies in order to establish the usefulness of this therapeutic strategy in the different kinds of CAP.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pfPij]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are an option in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the benefits and adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in severe CAP, have not been well assessed.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases from inception to May 2015 were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that evaluated use of corticosteroids in adult patients with CAP were included. The quality of outcomes was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs.

Results

Nine eligible RCTs (1,667 patients) and six cohort studies (4,095 patients) were identified. The mean corticosteroid dose and treatment duration were 30 mg/day methylprednisolone for 7 days. Corticosteroids did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low) in patients with CAP and patients with severe CAP (RCTs: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low; cohort studies: RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86–1.17). Corticosteroids treatment was associated with a decreased risk of ARDS (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.59) and may reduce lengths of hospital and ICU stay, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, and time to clinical stability. Corticosteroids were not associated with increased rates of adverse events.

Conclusions

Short-term treatment with corticosteroids is safe and may reduce the risk of ARDS, shortening the length of the disease in patients with CAP.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112wePkW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are well-known and readily available anti-inflammatory medications that much evidence has shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients. Based on the RECOVERY trial, a medium-dose regimen (6 mg of DXM once daily) was beneficial only for COVID-19 patients who received respiratory support or had inflammation that required control. Subsequently, several studies reported that a high-dose to pulse regimen was also beneficial in COVID-19 patients with severe and critical illnesses and appeared to improve outcomes more than a medium-dose regimen. Based on the evidence, three main factors should be considered to predict the advantage of systemic corticosteroids: (1) degree of inflammation, (2) dose of corticosteroids, and (3) drug tissue concentration.

Firstly, COVID-19 patients who manifest severe to critical illness or meet hyperinflammatory response conditions will deteriorate as these conditions indicate that anti-inflammatory treatment is required to mitigate the inflammatory process. This is important not only in the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia but also ARDS in the terminal phase of infection to lessen inflammation and tissue injury. In the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, the timing of administration is determined by the benefit of inflammation control over the risk of prolonged viral shedding, which has to be discussed. Studies by Raef Fadel et al. and Pablo Monedero et al. have shown that early (within 48 h) corticosteroids use in moderate to critically ill patients results in lower mortality, shorter stays in ICU, decreased organ dysfunction, and fewer days on MV. Secondly, the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids depends on their dose categorized by mg of prednisolone equivalent dose per day: low-dose (≤ 7.5 mg), medium-dose (> 7.5 mg and ≤ 30 mg), high-dose (> 30 mg), very high-dose (> 100 mg), and pulse therapy (≥ 250 mg). Corticosteroids have a dual action pathway: they inhibit inflammation through genomic and non-genomic pathways. The treatment regimen, which involved a prednisolone equivalent dose exceeding 100 mg, demonstrated significant non-genomic potency, contributing to rapidly suppressing the inflammation. It was proven in a triple-blind RCT by Keivan Ranjbar et al. that a very high-dose regimen was more effective than a medium-dose one (as in the RECOVERY trial) for patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, it does not increase the risk of infections that most studies have reported. Thirdly, MP might have contributed to better outcomes because of its tendency to concentrate in lung tissue more than DXM. In COVID-19, however, no clinical trial has been established to support this issue.

### The efficacy of corticosteroids therapy in patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial [^111oWQqg]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic. The disease is associated with a series of clinical settings from asymptomatic infections to mild and severe manifestations, contributing to a significant morbidity and mortality, as well as strain on intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.

As the pandemic progresses, overwhelming body of evidence regarding the pathological pattern of the disease and the potential impact of immunomodulatory strategies has suggested that cytokine storm may be the main cause of disease progression (the severity and clinical outcomes) leading to lung injury and organ failure.

Supportive and adjuvant therapy have been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 due to the absence of specific treatments such as antivirals. The histological pattern of pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) which characterize acute lung injury of the disease suggest that timely and appropriate use of corticosteroid may be beneficial in patients with severe disease.

The severity and pathophysiology of the disease have been linked to hyperinflammation, therefore, a combination therapy of off-label drugs such as immunosuppressor/immunomodulator, inflammatory cytokines antagonists, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be of utmost importance in mitigating the potential effects of cytokine storm in the inflammation-driven damaging phases of COVID-19.

Corticosteroids suppress inflammation-induced lung injury by inhibiting lung inflammation in critically ill patients. On February 6th, 2020, researchers from Edinburgh published a short review of clinical data regarding the outcomes of corticosteroid therapy in respiratory diseases. They concluded that there is no clinical data that supports the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. This was recapitulated by WHO who discouraged the use of steroids in Covid-19. Rapidly, the response from physicians from Wuhan and Beijing appeared. They opposed the liberal use of corticosteroids and recommend short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose, used prudently, for the most severely ill patients. The most robust evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids therapy came from the COVID-19 RECOVERY Trial. In this trial, the 28-day mortality rate for COVID-19 patients requiring either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy was decreased in patients treated with low dose dexamethasone (6 mg once daily). This finding led to the recommendation of corticosteroids therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients by the WHO (WHO, 2020).

### Corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: time to act! [^116y2USV]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with community-acquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117SaqsZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advances in diagnostic methods and antibiotic treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of mortality. In the industrialized countries, CAP is the sixth highest cause of mortality and the first among infectious diseases. Although mortality in patients with CAP fell dramatically with the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s, since then it has remained relatively stable. Current series report an overall mortality rate of 8 to 15%.

A recent study of the factors associated with early death in patients with CAP reinforces the classical concept that some deaths were not due to failure to eradicate the microorganism causing CAP, but are closely related to inadequate host response. Excessive cytokine response in patients with severe CAP has been linked in many previous studies with deleterious effects and poor prognosis.

In this context, the use of immunomodulation appears to be an appealing option for improving prognosis in CAP. Theoretically, an anti-inflammatory treatment given prior to antibiotic therapy could prevent an excessive inflammatory response, improving the prognosis of more severe episodes of CAP. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy for pneumonia has been a matter of debate. Corticosteroids are known to reduce the production of the main inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6), and the subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space leading to a more equilibrated response.

Here we conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to analyse whether a corticosteroid therapy, administered in the form of a methyl-prednisolone bolus given prior to antibiotic treatment followed by sustained infusion for nine days, was able to modulate the inflammatory response and clinical outcome of selected hospital-admitted CAP patients presenting respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LaX6J]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the reporting guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO.

Search strategy and study selection

We performed a comprehensive systematic search of the Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus databases for articles published between the database inception and April 24, 2023, using appropriate prespecified search terms: "community-acquired pneumonia", "corticosteroid", and "steroid". Only RCTs that assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of adult patients with sCAP were included. To identify relevant reports, we manually searched the reference lists of systematic and narrative reviews and studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included if the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) criteria were met: (a) Population: adult patients (i.e. 18 years of age or older) with sCAP; (b) Intervention: systemic corticosteroids were used regardless of the type of corticosteroid, duration of treatment, dosage, or route of administration (i.e. intervention group); (c) Comparison: placebo or standard care (i.e. control group), (d) Outcomes: mortality, the use of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of intensive care unit ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and the adverse events (AEs). In this study, sCAP was defined as CAP accompanied by requiring ICU admission, or meeting either the criteria for severe pneumonia by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) or classified as risk class V of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Only peer-reviewed RCTs were included in the analysis without restrictions on language, sample size, age, sex, ethnicity, or publication date.

We excluded studies that (1) focused on patients with septic shock; (2) reported data from post-hoc analysis; (3) were published only as conference posters, case series, case reports, or single-arm studies; (4) did not report outcomes of interest; or (5) were pharmacokinetic investigations.

Study selection

Two independent investigators (JYW and YWT) screened the titles and abstracts of the studies to identify potentially eligible studies. Full-text copies of the potentially relevant articles were obtained and reviewed for eligibility. In case of disagreement, a third investigator (WHH) was consulted.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^1117TmRy]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Patients were grouped by their initial treatment into those who did and did not receive corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone), which was considered to have been given if the patient received at least 72-h treatment with prednisone or an equivalent at a dosage of ≥ 30 mg/day in the first 48 h of admission. Septic shock was defined according to the ATS/IDSA pneumonia guidelines. Empiric antimicrobial treatment was deemed appropriate when the isolated pathogens had in vitro susceptibility to at least one of the administered antimicrobials or follow ATS/IDSA guidelines recommendation if no pathogen was isolated.

Outcomes

The main outcome was the 28-day all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was the length of stay in hospital.

### Do corticosteroids reduce the mortality of influenza A (H1N1) infection? A meta-analysis [^1139sTaB]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Although corticosteroids are widely used, the effect of corticosteroids on pandemic A (H1N1) influenza patients has not been studied adequately and, thus, is still controversial. For example, in several studies a remarkable effect was observed of early treatment with oseltamivir and steroids for patients with severe pneumonia in preventing disease progression. Additionally, a number of clinical case series and case reports have shown that patients with severe respiratory complications, pneumonia, improved after the use of corticosteroids. However, the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the use of corticosteroids as a primary medicine for H1N1 infection, with the exception that a reasonable dose is indicated for a specific reason; for example, pulmonary obstruction or septic shock. Moreover, World Health Organization guidelines for Pharmacological Management of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 and other Influenza Viruses recommend that systemic corticosteroids should not be administrated to patients who have severe or progressive clinical illness unless in some exceptional circumstances. Severe influenza treatment guidelines for Korea also indicate that systemic corticosteroid administration should not be performed for the treatment of severe influenza patients unless the therapeutic effect has already been proven. None of the guidelines above recommend systematic corticosteroid use regularly with H1N1 infection. However, lack of clinical evidence makes these recommendations or guidelines unconvincing.

Until now, many studies involving the treatment of severe H1N1 cases have been published, but the results are inconsistent, which could be due to insufficient sample sizes, complicated clinical status, or study design. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic literature review evaluating the benefit of corticosteroids to severe H1N1 infection. A principal resource for the optimal clinical therapy of influenza A (H1N1) patients and directions for future research are warranted.

We therefore conducted the present study to determine whether corticosteroids can treat severe H1N1 infection. To clarify the association of corticosteroids with H1N1 mortality taking into account clinical status and study design, we examined the associations in larger, prospective cohort studies in global settings, using existing literature, and assessed the effect of corticosteroids treatment on mortality through meta-analysis.

### Corticosteroids for pleural infection: should we STOPPE studying? [^114Fyopv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Without a trend toward benefit from steroids in parapneumonic effusions, does this shut the door on any future trials in this area? We would argue that it should not. As a first-of-its-kind pilot study, its authors should be commended. Interventional pleural studies are inherently difficult, as evidenced by the attrition from screening to randomization owing to patient factors alone. As a pilot study should, it has generated many questions that need addressing before future trials are performed.

A key issue is that of the optimal target population. In an era of large platform trials, overly restrictive inclusion criteria should be avoided. However, the spectrum of parapneumonic effusions is so wide that the fundamental aim of steroid therapy is affected. Are we trying to prevent the development of pleural infection? In that case, we should target only simple parapneumonic effusions at the earliest possible time point, especially given that corticosteroids seem to benefit adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia with or without an effusion. This is a valid approach, but only a minority of simple parapneumonic effusions progress to pleural infection, so the trial size needed to demonstrate a difference would be large, and the potential benefit-to-risk ratio of steroids could be marginal. Alternatively, one could argue for an approach of targeting established cases of pleural infection to augment the inflammation that is driving fluid production and loculation. Such a trial might include patients in whom initial medical management had already been performed, and the potential role of steroids would be to reduce ongoing symptoms, or hospital length of stay, or persistent pleural thickening, all endpoints that were deemed feasible to collect within the STOPPE trial.

Beyond trial design, the choice of steroid, dosing, and route is an important area. The investigators very reasonably chose dexamethasone for its strong antiinflammatory effects with minimal mineralocorticoid effect and long duration of action. However, 8 mg daily in divided doses is a relatively small dose compared with other inflammatory conditions related to infection, such as bacterial meningitis, for which 40 mg daily is administered. The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial demonstrated that just 6 mg daily reduced mortality in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but is currently testing doses of 20 mg daily after promising results from other trials. In addition, the intravenous route might not be necessary, given the bioavailability of oral dexamethasone, which would reduce adverse effects (e.g. phlebitis), costs, and complexity of intravenous administration.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^113ydXL9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Possible benefits include amelioration of organ damage secondary to excessive host inflammatory responses via their anti-inflammatory properties, or mitigation of septic shock via their effects on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis. Corticosteroids lowered mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, in a recent study of severe CAP, and in a post hoc analysis of CAP patients in a larger trial of steroids for septic shock. A recent guideline statement now recommends corticosteroid administration for severe CAP. However, other studies yielded inconsistent results, corticosteroids carry known side effects, and uncertainty persists regarding the type and dose of corticosteroids and whether treatment should be given broadly or to particular subgroups of patients.

REMAP-CAP is an ongoing international platform trial (NCT02735707) designed to evaluate treatments for patients with severe CAP in pandemic and non-pandemic settings. The REMAP-CAP investigators previously reported that hydrocortisone appeared to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, administered either as a fixed-dose 1-week course or titrated depending on the presence and duration of shock. REMAP-CAP also contains a corticosteroid domain for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, where patients were randomized to one of several corticosteroid strategies or control. On December 6th, 2023, the platform ceased randomization to one of the corticosteroid strategies, fixed-duration hydrocortisone, on the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) after that arm triggered a pre-specified stopping rule for futility compared to control (no corticosteroid). Data were locked after the last patient completed follow-up for the primary end point and the results are presented here.

### Interstitial lung diseases in the hospitalized patient [^115n5tCh]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What pharmacologic treatments should be administered?

There are no well-designed, randomized, double blind placebo controlled trials to guide the pharmacologic therapy of the hospitalized ILD patient. Due to the challenge in differentiating lung infection from an acute presentation of ILD or acute exacerbation of preexisting ILD, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered in all patients. Nevertheless, clinical experience suggests that patients with specific ILDs improve with corticosteroid treatment. ILDs that appear to be steroid responsive are COP, AEP, some cases of CTD-ILD (importantly, high doses of corticosteroids are not recommended in SSc-ILD), and drug-induced ILDs. Response rates correspond to the underlying pathology, with eosinophilic pneumonia and OP being the most steroid responsive. The majority of patients with COP respond to corticosteroid treatment and have resolution of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities within weeks to months of initiating therapy. A typical initial dose of corticosteroid is 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone, which is then tapered to 20 mg/day after several weeks. Relapses may occur when treatment is stopped or rapidly tapered. One year of treatment is often recommended. Corticosteroids are also useful in the management of AEP. Patients with AEP can have dramatic clinical improvement within 24–48 h after initiating corticosteroid treatment.

Whether corticosteroids or immunosuppressants benefit patients with AE-IPF or AE of ILD other than IPF is uncertain. Corticosteroids may be beneficial when chest imaging suggests organizing pneumonia is present. Because of reports that azathioprine is associated with worse outcomes in patients with IPF or other forms of DAD, the use of cytotoxic medications should not be used for management of these patients. In contrast to AE-IPF, there is a biologic rationale for treating AE of CTD-ILD patients with immunosuppressants. The driving force behind these diseases is believed to be hyperactivity of the immune system. Therefore, immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine may be useful in these patients.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1129oQWf]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids and biologics — pneumonia risk is dose dependent in steroid-treated patients, with increased risk generally occurring when exposed to at least 20 mg equivalent of prednisone daily for more than 2–4 weeks; lower doses (i.e., 10 mg/d) taken for prolonged periods can also confer an increased risk, and the infectious spectrum includes Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and typical causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Blockade of TNFα increases susceptibility to tuberculosis, IL-6 inhibitors and JAK kinase inhibitors have been associated with higher TB risk, other cytokine blockers (anti–IL-12/IL-23, anti–IL-23, anti–IL-17) carry TB warnings but an elevated TB risk has not been demonstrated to date, and additional risk accrues with diabetes, cigarette smoking, advanced age, and concomitant immunosuppressants.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111t6ft5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

GRADE recommendation statement

The use of corticosteroids in established ARDS should be the subject of a suitably powered, multicentre RCT with long-term follow-up (GRADE Recommendation: research recommendation).

GRADE recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit and the risk of harm appears small, although the group noted that the trials did not include longer term follow-up of survivors. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality from clinical trials, which were mostly conducted before the current era of lung protective ventilation. In addition, the lack of sufficient power in any individual study or in the combined MA and the heterogeneity of the dose, timing and agent used also influenced the decision. The group believed that a position of equipoise exists and the research recommendation reflects this view.

As a caveat, it is worth mentioning that specific steroid responsive disorders may mimic ARDS, for example, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

Implications for future research

A large, multicentre study on steroids in established ARDS is currently planned.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111F5rZm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ICI-pneumonitis grade 2 or greater — treatment approach and unresolved issues — details that proposed treatments include ICI cessation, systemic corticosteroids, and variable recommendations for additional immune-suppressive medications; symptomatic disease management has centered on withholding the ICI agent, treating with systemic corticosteroids over 4 to 6 weeks, and adding immunosuppressive medications in refractory cases, yet the optimal timing, dose, and duration of corticosteroid therapy, as well as the optimal dose, duration, and type of immunosuppressive treatment for steroid-refractory disease, have not been defined; a "rebound" or "flare" of worsening pneumonitis after steroid discontinuation has been described with limited guidance for further therapy, and phenotypic, radiographic, or other diagnostic findings (such as BAL differential) may clarify response and should be evaluated for guiding treatment.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: equity-related analyses and update on evidence [^111A5D9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, size of effect, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether and at which doses systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 6 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care, different types, doses and timings (early versus late) of corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality up to 30 and 120 days, discharged alive (clinical improvement), new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death (clinical worsening), serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections.

Main Results

We included 16 RCTs in 9549 participants, of whom 8271 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 4532 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 3766). These studies included participants mostly older than 50 years and male. We also identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 11 RCTs (8019 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analyses included outcome data from 10 studies. Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care compared to standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.97; 7898 participants; estimated absolute effect: 274 deaths per 1000 people not receiving systemic corticosteroids compared to 246 deaths per 1000 people receiving the intervention (95% CI 230 to 265 per 1000 people); moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.34; 485 participants). The chance of clinical improvement (discharged alive at day 28) may slightly increase (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11; 6786 participants; low-certainty evidence) while the risk of clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death) may slightly decrease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 5586 participants; low-certainty evidence). For serious adverse events (two RCTs, 678 participants), adverse events (three RCTs, 447 participants), hospital-acquired infections (four RCTs, 598 participants), and invasive fungal infections (one study, 64 participants), we did not perform any analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence (high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one RCT (86 participants) comparing methylprednisolone to dexamethasone, thus the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of methylprednisolone on all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.07; 86 participants). None of the other outcomes of interest were reported in this study. We included four RCTs (1383 participants) comparing high-dose dexamethasone (12 mg or higher) to low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg to 8 mg). High-dose dexamethasone compared to low-dose dexamethasone may reduce all-cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04; 1269 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of high-dose dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08; 1383 participants) and it may have little or no impact on clinical improvement (discharged alive at 28 days) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.09; 200 participants; low-certainty evidence). Studies did not report data on clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death). For serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital-acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections, we did not perform analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low-certainty evidence. We could not identify studies for comparisons of different timing and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. Equity-related subgroup analyses We conducted the following subgroup analyses to explore equity-related factors: sex, age (< 70 years; ≥ 70 years), ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of residence (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries). Except for age and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For all-cause mortality up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seemed to benefit from systemic corticosteroids in comparison to those aged 70 years and older. The few participants from a Black, Asian, or other minority ethnic group showed a larger estimated effect than the many White participants. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease There are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality up to 30 days in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19, while the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on all-cause mortality up to 120 days. For younger people (under 70 years of age) there was a potential advantage, as well as for Black, Asian, or people of a minority ethnic group; further subgroup analyses showed no relevant effects. Evidence related to the most effective type, dose, or timing of systemic corticosteroids remains immature. Currently, there is no evidence on asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). Due to the low to very low certainty of the current evidence, we cannot assess safety adequately to rule out harmful effects of the treatment, therefore there is an urgent need for good-quality safety data. Findings of equity-related subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution because of their explorative nature, low precision, and missing data. We identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design, suggesting there may be possible changes of the effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future.

### Low-dose methylprednisolone treatment in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia [^112JDFqr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring intensive care unit admission is associated with significant acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that downregulation of systemic and pulmonary inflammation with prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone treatment would accelerate pneumonia resolution and improve clinical outcomes.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial recruited adult patients within 72–96 h of hospital presentation. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio; an intravenous 40 mg loading bolus was followed by 40 mg/day through day 7 and progressive tapering during the 20-day treatment course. Randomization was stratified by site and need for mechanical ventilation (MV) at the time of randomization. Outcomes included a primary endpoint of 60-day all-cause mortality and secondary endpoints of morbidity and mortality up to 1 year of follow-up.

Results

Between January 2012 and April 2016, 586 patients from 42 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers were randomized, short of the 1420 target sample size because of low recruitment. 584 patients were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in 60-day mortality between the methylprednisolone and placebo arms (16% vs. 18%; adjusted odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.57–1.40). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes or complications.

Conclusions

In patients with severe CAP, prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone treatment did not significantly reduce 60-day mortality. Treatment was not associated with increased complications.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

### Corticosteroid treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116mTsWk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-February 2007) and EMBASE (1980-February 2007) were searched to identify English- and French-language publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults. Major search terms included community-acquired pneumonia, intensive care unit, steroids, glucocorticoids, and adrenal cortex hormones.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical studies that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults were included. Clinical and surrogate markers of pneumonia were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Severe CAP is associated with an increase in pulmonary and circulatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha that may be associated with higher mortality. Corticosteroids suppress inflammatory reactions and prevent migration of inflammatory cells from the circulation to tissues by suppressing the synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. One observational comparative study and 2 randomized, controlled studies examined the effects of corticosteroid therapy at various doses on endpoints of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and clinical outcomes. One small observational pilot study revealed that methylprednisolone blunted some of the pulmonary and systemic markers of inflammation. One small, randomized, placebo-controlled study revealed that hydrocortisone had no significant effects on markers of pulmonary and systemic inflammation or clinical outcomes. Another small, randomized, placebo-controlled preliminary study with methodological limitations revealed improvements in oxygenation, organ dysfunction score, and markers of inflammation favoring hydrocortisone over placebo.

Conclusions

Given the lack of proven benefit on clinically meaningful endpoints and adverse events, corticosteroids cannot be recommended for adjunctive treatment of severe CAP.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1179y2LX]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock — evidence summary reports that a total of 46 randomized controlled trials compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in sepsis or septic shock, with populations spanning sepsis (seven trials), CAP and sepsis (five), ARDS and sepsis (four), and the remainder septic shock; six trials examined pediatric patients, one included both adults and children, and the remainder included only adults. Corticosteroid use may reduce hospital/long-term mortality (from 60 d to 1 yr) (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00, low certainty) and probably reduces ICU/short-term mortality (14–30 d) (RR 0.93; 95% Cl, 0.88–0.98, moderate certainty) in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and subgroup analysis based on corticosteroid type, duration, or dosage did not demonstrate any credible subgroup effects.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — corticosteroids in hospitalized patients and pediatric considerations: Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids are recommended in certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (recommendations 7–9), but the studies informing these recommendations either did not include children or did not separately report outcomes for participants under 18 years. Corticosteroid use is nevertheless common in hospitalized children with COVID-19, and there is reason to believe that the risk benefit ratio would be similar in children and adults.

### Inhaled steroids and risk of pneumonia for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117D3Qru]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are anti-inflammatory drugs that have proven benefits for people with worsening symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations. They are commonly used as combination inhalers with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) to reduce exacerbation rates and all-cause mortality, and to improve lung function and quality of life. The most common combinations of ICS and LABA used in combination inhalers are fluticasone and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and a new formulation of fluticasone in combination with vilanterol, which is now available. ICS have been associated with increased risk of pneumonia, but the magnitude of risk and how this compares with different ICS remain unclear. Recent reviews conducted to address their safety have not compared the relative safety of these two drugs when used alone or in combination with LABA.

Objectives

To assess the risk of pneumonia associated with the use of fluticasone and budesonide for COPD.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), clinicaltrials.gov, reference lists of existing systematic reviews and manufacturer websites. The most recent searches were conducted in September 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies were included if they compared the ICS budesonide or fluticasone versus placebo, or either ICS in combination with a LABA versus the same LABA as monotherapy for people with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, numerical data and risk of bias information for each included study. We looked at direct comparisons of ICS versus placebo separately from comparisons of ICS/LABA versus LABA for all outcomes, and we combined these with subgroups when no important heterogeneity was noted. After assessing for transitivity, we conducted an indirect comparison to compare budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy, but we could not do the same for the combination therapies because of systematic differences between the budesonide and fluticasone combination data sets. When appropriate, we explored the effects of ICS dose, duration of ICS therapy and baseline severity on the primary outcome. Findings of all outcomes are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADEPro.

Main Results

We found 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and more evidence was provided for fluticasone (26 studies; n = 21,247) than for budesonide (17 studies; n = 10,150). Evidence from the budesonide studies was more inconsistent and less precise, and the studies were shorter. The populations within studies were more often male with a mean age of around 63, mean pack-years smoked over 40 and mean predicted forced expiratory volume of one second (FEV1) less than 50%. High or uneven dropout was considered a high risk of bias in almost 40% of the trials, but conclusions for the primary outcome did not change when the trials at high risk of bias were removed in a sensitivity analysis. Fluticasone increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events (requiring hospital admission) (odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.12; 18 more per 1000 treated over 18 months; high quality), and no evidence suggested that this outcome was reduced by delivering it in combination with salmeterol or vilanterol (subgroup differences: I(2) = 0%, P value 0.51), or that different doses, trial duration or baseline severity significantly affected the estimate. Budesonide also increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events compared with placebo, but the effect was less precise and was based on shorter trials (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.62; six more per 1000 treated over nine months; moderate quality). Some of the variation in the budesonide data could be explained by a significant difference between the two commonly used doses: 640 mcg was associated with a larger effect than 320 mcg relative to placebo (subgroup differences: I(2) = 74%, P value 0.05). An indirect comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy revealed no significant differences with respect to serious adverse events (pneumonia-related or all-cause) or mortality. The risk of any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases treated in the community) was higher with fluticasone than with budesonide (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34); this was the only significant difference reported between the two drugs. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of possible differences in the assignment of pneumonia diagnosis, and because no trials directly compared the two drugs. No significant difference in overall mortality rates was observed between either of the inhaled steroids and the control interventions (both high-quality evidence), and pneumonia-related deaths were too rare to permit conclusions to be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide and fluticasone, delivered alone or in combination with a LABA, are associated with increased risk of serious adverse pneumonia events, but neither significantly affected mortality compared with controls. The safety concerns highlighted in this review should be balanced with recent cohort data and established randomised evidence of efficacy regarding exacerbations and quality of life. Comparison of the two drugs revealed no statistically significant difference in serious pneumonias, mortality or serious adverse events. Fluticasone was associated with higher risk of any pneumonia when compared with budesonide (i.e. less serious cases dealt with in the community), but variation in the definitions used by the respective manufacturers is a potential confounding factor in their comparison. Primary research should accurately measure pneumonia outcomes and should clarify both the definition and the method of diagnosis used, especially for new formulations such as fluticasone furoate, for which little evidence of the associated pneumonia risk is currently available. Similarly, systematic reviews and cohorts should address the reliability of assigning 'pneumonia' as an adverse event or cause of death and should determine how this affects the applicability of findings.

### Comparison of pulse-dose and high-dose corticosteroids with no corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia in the intensive care unit [^112ywRM5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid dosing in the range of 0.5–2mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone equivalents has become a standard part of the management of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia based on positive results of randomized trials and a meta-analysis. Alongside such conventional dosing, administration of 1gm of methylprednisolone daily (pulse dosing) has also been reported in the literature with claims of favorable outcomes. Comparisons between such disparate approaches to corticosteroids for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia are lacking. In this retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia, we compared patients treated with 0.5–2mg/kg/day in methylprednisolone equivalents (high-dose corticosteroids) and patients treated with 1gm of methylprednisolone (pulse-dose corticosteroids) to those who did not receive any corticosteroids. The endpoints of interest were hospital mortality, ICU-free days at Day 28, and complications potentially attributable to corticosteroids. Pulse-dose corticosteroid therapy was associated with a significant increase in ICU-free days at Day 28 compared to no receipt: adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–2.02; p = 0.03) and compared with high-dose corticosteroid administration (p = 0.003). Nonetheless, receipt of high-dose corticosteroids-but not of pulse-dose corticosteroids-significantly reduced the odds of hospital mortality compared to no receipt: adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) 0.31 (95% CI: 0.12–0.77; p = 0.01). High-dose corticosteroids reduced mortality compared to pulse-dose corticosteroids (p = 0.04). Pulse-dose corticosteroids-but not high-dose corticosteroids-significantly increased the odds of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy compared to no receipt: aOR 3.53 (95% CI: 1.27–9.82; p = 0.02). The odds of this complication were also significantly higher in the pulse-dose group when compared to the high-dose group (p = 0.05 for the comparison). In this single-center study, pulse-dose corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU was associated with an increase in ICU-free days but failed to impact hospital mortality, perhaps because of its association with development of severe renal failure. In line with existing trial data, the effect of high-dose corticosteroids on mortality was favorable.

### Incident pneumonia and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A double effect of inhaled corticosteroids? [^116fSukr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although their use improves quality of life and reduces exacerbations, it is associated with increased risk of pneumonia. Curiously, their use has not been associated with increased risk of pneumonia-related or overall mortality. We review pertinent literature to further explore the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on incident pneumonia and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The association of use of inhaled corticosteroids and incident pneumonia is substantial and has been present in the majority of the studies on the topic. This includes both randomized controlled trials and observational studies. However, all of the studies have substantial risk of bias. Most randomized trials are limited by lack of systematic ascertainment of pneumonia; they depended on adverse event reporting. Many observational studies included proper radiographic assessment of pneumonia, but they are limited by their retrospective, observational design. The unadjusted higher risk of pneumonia is associated with longer duration of use, more potent ICS compounds, and higher doses. That implies a dose-effect relationship. Unlike pneumonia, mortality is a precise outcome. Despite the robust association of inhaled corticosteroid use with increased risk of pneumonia, all studies find either no difference or a reduction in pulmonary-related and overall mortality associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. These observations suggest a double effect of inhaled corticosteroids (i.e., an adverse effect plus an unexplained mitigating effect).

### Effect of corticosteroids on mortality and clinical cure in community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized control trials [^114RQ84x]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Corticosteroids may be a beneficial adjunct in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Research Question

Is there any benefit of corticosteroid therapy in the management of bacterial CAP among patients requiring hospitalization?

Study Design and Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify randomized controlled trials assessing the use of systemic corticosteroids compared with standard care in the management of CAP. A systematic review, meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) were performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, treatment failure, readmission, and adverse events. Data are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI, P value, heterogeneity (I 2), and TSA-adjusted CIs.

Results

Sixteen trials met the eligibility criteria. All-cause mortality (16 studies [3,842 patients]; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.67–1.07]; p = 0.17; I² = 14%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.61–1.09), ICU admission (six studies [2,619 patients]; RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45–0.97]; p = 0.04; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.37–1.12), treatment failure (six studies [2,093 patients]; RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.37–1.67]; p = 0.52; I² = 68%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.02–25.5), and the incidence of adverse events (six studies [2,487 patients]; RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.97–1.25]; p = 0.14; I² = 53%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.82–2.41) were similar between patients receiving corticosteroids and patients assigned to the control group. The need for mechanical ventilation (eight studies [1,457 patients]; RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33–0.77]; p = 0.001; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.20–0.85) was lower among patients receiving corticosteroids compared with those receiving standard care. However, corticosteroid use may be associated with higher rates of hospital readmission (five studies [2,853 patients]; RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05–1.38]; p = 0.008; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.89–1.98).

Interpretation

Corticosteroid therapy is associated with a lower incidence of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with CAP. No association was found between corticosteroid therapy and mortality, treatment failure, or adverse events.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^111GQZsG]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (adult inpatients) — Evidence summary indicates Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to no corticosteroids in adult hospitalized patients with suspected or probable bacterial CAP, including severe and less severe disease. Severe CAP was classified as severe if 50% or more of participants had severe pneumonia or if most patients were admitted to the ICU at the time of randomization or required IV continuous vasopressor therapy; overall, 10 trials were classified as severe disease and 8 trials as less-severe disease. In severe CAP, corticosteroids probably reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.85; moderate certainty), an effect not seen in less severe CAP (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.83–1.42; low certainty) (subgroup interaction based on severity: p = 0.01), and there was also a subgroup effect on mortality by corticosteroid molecule (p < 0.001).

### Corticosteroids for adult patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QpFWJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

International clinical practice guidelines addressing corticosteroid treatment for patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of corticosteroids in hospitalised adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed random effects pairwise, Bayesian, and dose-response meta-analyses using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology.

Results

We identified 30 eligible RCTs, including a total of 7519 patients. The prednisone-equivalent doses ranged between 29 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term (28–30 days) mortality (RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74–0.91]; moderate certainty) while the reduction in longer term (60–90 day) mortality is less certain (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.76–1.03]; low certainty). Corticosteroids reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.48–0.82]; high certainty) and may reduce duration of ICU stay (MD 1.53 days fewer [95% CI 0.31–2.75 days fewer]; low certainty), and hospital stay (MD 2.30 days fewer [95% CI 0.81–3.81 days fewer]; low certainty). Corticosteroids probably increased hyperglycaemia requiring intervention (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.12–1.56]; moderate certainty) but probably have no effect on secondary infections (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85–1.11]; moderate certainty).

Conclusion

Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term mortality and reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with CAP.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^111NjCeu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The most appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a high-dose methylprednisolone versus a high-dose dexamethasone in hospitalized moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, regarding the WHO clinical progression scales, mortality, and the length of hospitalization.

Methods

In this open-labeled randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients with age > 18 years old who were diagnosed moderate COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by real-time PCR, evidence of pneumonia by chest imaging and resting oxygen saturation between 90 and 94%. Patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive methylprednisolone 250 mg/day or dexamethasone 20 mg/day over the first three days. Then the patients in both groups received dexamethasone 20 mg/day on days 4–5, and 10 mg/day on days 6–10. Primary outcome was assessed by a 10-point WHO clinical progression scales ranging from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 10) on the fifth day of treatment. Secondary outcomes including 90-day mortality, length of hospitalization, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and complications were determined.

Results

Of 98 eligible patients, the mean age was 76.0 ± 13.3 years. The median date of illness at the time of randomization was 3 days (interquartile range 2, 5). Baseline clinical characteristics and severity did not differ between groups. The WHO clinical progression scales were similar between methylprednisolone and dexamethasone group at 5 and 10 days of treatment [4.84, (95% confidence interval(CI), 4.35–5.33) vs. 4.76 (95% CI, 4.27–5.25), p = 0.821 and 4.32 (95% CI, 3.83–4.81) vs. 3.80 (95% CI, 3.31–4.29), p = 0.140, respectively)]. Both groups did not differ in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalization, and rate of ICU transfer. There were also no differences in steroid-related complications between groups until 90 days of follow-up.

Conclusions

In patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, initial anti-inflammatory treatment with 250 mg/day of methylprednisolone for three days does not yield better outcomes over high-dose dexamethasone.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113crMig]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^116LeFzN]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — Recommendations state: "We "recommend" administering corticosteroids to adult patients hospitalized with severe bacterial CAP (strong recommendation, moderate certainty)". In contrast, "We "make no recommendation" for administering corticosteroids for adult patients hospitalized with less severe bacterial CAP", and "We make no recommendation for corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with CAP".

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^116Hmoeb]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidence to recommendation for CAP — there was general agreement among the panel for a credible subgroup effect demonstrating a large desirable treatment effect of corticosteroid use for patients with severe CAP with less magnitude of benefit in less severe CAP, and given this subgroup effect the panel decided to make separate recommendations for severe and nonsevere CAP. Overall, the panel felt that the balance of beneficial and undesirable effects favors giving corticosteroids to patients with more severe CAP but was uncertain in patients with less severe CAP; this judgment was driven in part by the CAPE COD randomized controlled trial (RCT), which represented approximately 35% of the severe CAP subgroup patients and showed a strong mortality benefit with the use of corticosteroids. Evidence informing cost-effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in CAP is lacking, though one study suggests cost savings with a more pronounced benefit in those with severe CAP; definitions for severe CAP and use of risk stratification scores are variable across RCTs. Although the panel considered a conditional recommendation against corticosteroids in less severe diseases, consensus was not achieved and further RCTs evaluating corticosteroids in less severe CAP are urgently needed. Of note, 2 of the 18 RCTs included in the analysis were done in low- to middle-income countries.

### Corticosteroid administration for viral pneumonia: COVID-19 and beyond [^115ZM5Hs]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome by many clinicians because of their perceived anti-inflammatory effects. However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial.

Objectives

The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia.

Sources

We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroid therapy for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases.

Content

We systematically summarized the effects of corticosteroid therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of action for corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Implications

Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for individuals with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% versus 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared individuals with non-severe disease, those with severe disease were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% versus 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence that corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality in people with COVID-19, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with severity of and mortality from COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.

### Final approval for corticosteroids in severe CAP? For sure, in septic shock [^114gKmAU]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of corticosteroids in the care of critically ill patients has been the subject of continuous research efforts with discrepant results. In sepsis, several "swings of the pendulum" for administering such drugs have occurred in the last two decades. A continuous and growing interest is in determining their role in a common source of sepsis: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. Some studies in the last decade aimed to determine if corticosteroids resulted in a clinical benefit to the patients with the most severe clinical presentation and highest mortality of CAP: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP). Corticosteroids have already been shown to be beneficial in those with high systemic inflammatory response and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids may also be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, who may have a more severe inflammatory response to sCAP. However, other studies have not found any significant benefit of corticosteroid therapy in CAP in mortality or treatment failure and have raised concerns about potential harm, including increased risk of secondary infections and delayed resolution for pneumonia.

Guidelines on use of corticosteroids — scope and focus delineate that updated evidence-based recommendations address the use of corticosteroids in the management of acutely ill patients requiring hospitalization, with recommendations intended for both adult and pediatric patient populations; the guideline update focused on sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which were prioritized as the most common diagnoses in which corticosteroids are considered and those with sufficient new data that reevaluation was warranted, and past guideline recommendations related to the definition and diagnosis of critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) were not addressed in this focused update.

### Efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116JJ7Yo]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid therapy in older adult patients with sCAP was associated with lower mortality, particularly when hydrocortisone is administered. The benefits are more notable with lower total doses (≤ 1,750 mg), extended treatment durations (≤ 7 days), and single-maintenance dosing. Additionally, corticosteroids are associated with shorter hospital and ICU stays, decreased need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, and reduced CRP levels. However, due to the heterogeneity in the definitions of adverse events across studies, the safety outcomes remain uncertain.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115c9t2v]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

The current study is subjected to several limitations. First, there were differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, the definition of severe CAP as well as administration routes and dosages of corticosteroids among the included studies, which might contribute to some degree of interstudy heterogeneity. For example, in the study conducted by Marik and colleagues, a single dose of hydrocortisone was used; in other studies, a prolonged duration of corticosteroids was used. The initiation time of corticosteroids also varied among studies. In the study performed by Dequin and colleagues, hydrocortisone was administered within 24 hours of enrolment; however, in the trial performed by Meduri and colleagues, methylprednisolone was administered up to 96 hours of enrolment. Furthermore, the initiation time of corticosteroids was unreported in many studies. Because we did not have access to individual patient data, we were unable to assess how these differences might influence the reported outcomes. Nevertheless, we were able to minimise potential interstudy heterogeneity by stratifying corticosteroids into their subtypes; accordingly, the measure of interstudy heterogeneity, I 2, was non-substantial across most reported outcomes. We also performed multiple subgroup analyses to identify potential sources of heterogeneity, such as different corticosteroid dosages, geographical regions and risk of bias. Second, the generalisability of our findings may be limited due to the exclusion of certain patient populations in most primary studies. For example, most studies excluded patients who were immunosuppressed, pregnant, with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or at high risk for neuropsychiatric adverse effects. It is unclear how the results of this study apply to these populations. Third, the number of studies and sample size in some of the reported outcomes were small and likely underpowered for some types of corticosteroids after stratification. Fourth, the data presented in this study were limited to hospitalised patients with severe CAP and do not apply to patients with less severe CAP. Therefore, the effects of corticosteroids on less severe CAP remain unclear. Fifth, we used mean differences for continuous outcomes, even though reductions in the duration of ICU or hospital stay were probably not normally distributed. Finally, we were not able to evaluate for publication bias through the funnel plot for most of the outcomes due to the small number of studies available.

In conclusion, the use of hydrocortisone was associated with a reduction in overall mortality and improvement in pneumonia-related outcomes among patients with severe CAP. Other types of corticosteroids did not appear to provide these benefits though these analyses were limited by the number of studies available. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone and prednisolone on severe CAP.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZHGq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This meta-analysis evaluated the impact of corticosteroid therapy on short-term mortality outcomes in over 10,000 critically ill patients. A thorough literature search was conducted, and the study protocols were pre-registered. The review included a meticulous assessment of various subgroups of interest, employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and utilized GRADE methodology to evaluate the robustness of the evidence. Both a priori and post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential sources of statistical heterogeneity, with findings from these analyses largely aligning with the initial results. However, this review is not without limitations. Firstly, it spanned nearly five decades of clinical trials, during which continuous advancements were made in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, leading to significant clinical heterogeneity across studies. This heterogeneity is further compounded by variations in patient populations (including ARDS, sCAP, and sepsis), types of corticosteroids used, dosages, durations of treatment, and treatment protocols, all of which are influenced by evolving clinical guidelines. Despite conducting subgroup analyses, the potential for type I errors due to multiple comparisons remains a concern. Secondly, the findings pertain specifically to a defined patient population; although corticosteroids may be linked to reduced short-term mortality in critically ill patients, these results cannot be generalized to all ICU populations due to variations in underlying disease phenotypes, clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and regional practices. Third, identifying the right patient for a steroid treatment is no easy task. Clinical studies have reported different results not only for different diseases (sepsis vs. community acquired pneumonia) but also for subsets in these groups (sepsis vs. septic shock with continued vasopressor treatment; bacterial CAP vs. influenza vs. COVID). The optimal choice of corticosteroid and the potential benefit of supplementing a mineralocorticoid complicates things even more. Fourth, we also worried that a large reason for the varying effects of steroids on mortality is differing efficacy in different patient subgroups. In such a circumstance aggregating the results of many trials together only serves to obscure the important question of how to identify which patients are likely to benefit from steroids and which patients are not. Lastly, our analysis focused solely on short-term mortality outcomes, overlooking long-term follow-up data, quality of life assessments, and survival rates for critically ill patients. Future real-world studies may provide more tailored insights for the management of critically ill individuals. Subgroup analyses were restricted to the primary outcome (short-term mortality) due to the exploratory nature of secondary outcomes and potential risks of multiple testing. Future studies should consider predefined subgroup analyses for all outcomes to enhance interpretability.

Question development and evidence synthesis note that the panel identified five actionable Patients, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the use of corticosteroids in critical illness, which were largely derived and slightly modified from the 2017 guidelines; the panel generated a list of outcomes prioritized based on perceived patient importance but, due to limited data reported in the included studies, was unable to include all outcomes, and working with a medical librarian conducted systematic reviews to identify studies relevant to each of the five PICO questions.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^111MWn4t]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU corticosteroid evidence and dosing: Across 1,703 COVID-19 patients, the use of corticosteroids reduced the risk of 28-day mortality compared to no corticosteroids or placebo (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; high quality), with similar results in mechanically ventilated patients (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82; moderate quality), translating to 96 fewer deaths (95% CI 142 fewer to 47 fewer) per 1,000 patients receiving corticosteroids; the effect size for 28-day mortality was largest in trials using dexamethasone for up to 10 days (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82; moderate quality), followed by hydrocortisone (374 patients, OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.12, low quality) and methylprednisolone (47 patients, OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, very low quality), and a firm conclusion on comparative efficacy cannot be made; the effect of late administration in mechanically ventilated patients remains unclear, and the optimal dosing and duration are unclear, so until more evidence is available, we prefer using the dosing regimen from the RECOVERY trial (i.e., dexamethasone 6 mg/day for 10 days or equivalent); serious adverse events were variably reported and corticosteroids have a range of adverse effects, with several studies in viral pneumonia patients in the ICU showing increased or prolonged coronavirus RNA shedding with corticosteroid use and the clinical consequences of increased shedding uncertain because effects on duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital and ICU length of stay were not reported.

### Corticosteroids for pneumonia [^111Tb4BV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different types of infection, however their role in the treatment of pneumonia remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment of pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 3 March 2017, together with relevant conference proceedings and references of identified trials. We also searched three trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic corticosteroid therapy, given as adjunct to antibiotic treatment, versus placebo or no corticosteroids for adults and children with pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model when possible.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included 310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial awaits classification. All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the remaining 14 trials. Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications. Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93).

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Special considerations and dosing note that "The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidelines had previously recommended giving methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/d within 14 days of the diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200) (4)". This panel "decided to remove the qualifier based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio from the most recent recommendation". Updated analysis "did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid timing or type or dosage", so "a specific recommendation was not made for corticosteroid molecules". Reported dosing "range from 40 mg/d to 2 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone equivalent with a common duration ranging from 7 to 30 days", and common molecules in RCTs include "Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone".

Dosing of corticosteroids for severe CAP — the 2017 SCCM/ESICM guideline recommended corticosteroids for 5–7 days at a daily dose < 400 mg IV hydrocortisone or equivalent, and the updated recommendation recognizes that multiple dosing strategies are acceptable for severe CAP and likely related to clinician discretion. Typical doses range from 40 to 80 mg/d IV methylprednisolone equivalent for a duration of 5–7 days, with one study including a prolonged taper over 20 days, and one guided by clinical criteria for 8 or 14 days; current evidence did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid duration and showed a possible subgroup interaction on mortality based on corticosteroid molecule.

### Adjunct prednisone therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116K73ZA]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clinical trials yielded conflicting data about the benefit of adding systemic corticosteroids for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. We assessed whether short-term corticosteroid treatment reduces time to clinical stability in patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with community-acquired pneumonia from seven tertiary care hospitals in Switzerland within 24 h of presentation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either prednisone 50 mg daily for 7 days or placebo. The computer-generated randomisation was done with variable block sizes of four to six and stratified by study centre. The primary endpoint was time to clinical stability defined as time (days) until stable vital signs for at least 24 h, and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00973154.

Findings

From Dec 1, 2009, to May 21, 2014, of 2911 patients assessed for eligibility, 785 patients were randomly assigned to either the prednisone group (n = 392) or the placebo group (n = 393). Median time to clinical stability was shorter in the prednisone group (3.0 days, IQR 2.5–3.4) than in the placebo group (4.4 days, 4.0–5.0; hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.15–1.50, p < 0.0001). Pneumonia-associated complications until day 30 did not differ between groups (11 [3%] in the prednisone group and 22 [6%] in the placebo group; odds ratio [OR] 0.49 [95% CI 0.23–1.02]; p = 0.056). The prednisone group had a higher incidence of in-hospital hyperglycaemia needing insulin treatment (76 [19%] vs 43 [11%]; OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31–2.93, p = 0.0010). Other adverse events compatible with corticosteroid use were rare and similar in both groups.

Interpretation

Prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital shortens time to clinical stability without an increase in complications. This finding is relevant from a patient perspective and an important determinant of hospital costs and efficiency.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^11744VaY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a potentially fatal pulmonary disease. Although studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for severe CAP, the results remain inconsistent. Moreover, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to rank the effects of different types of corticosteroids. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of different corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the treatment of severe CAP with corticosteroids were included. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, secondary efficacy outcome was mechanical ventilation (MV), and safety outcome was the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

A total of 11 studies, involving 2042 participants, compared four corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone). The included trials were all corticosteroid versus placebo comparisons, resulting in a star-shaped network. Among the four corticosteroids, only hydrocortisone was significantly more effective at reducing mortality than placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). Additionally, hydrocortisone reduced the need for MV (RR, 0.73; 95% CrI, 0.51–0.93). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that low-to-moderate doses, short-course corticosteroids are associated with a reduction in both mortality and the need for MV.

Conclusion

In the evaluated corticosteroid regimen, hydrocortisone might be an effective measure to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with severe CAP.

Clinical trial number

The present study is a meta-analysis and literature review, therefore clinical trial number is not applicable.

Table 1 — Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes questions — corticosteroid use in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is framed by five PICO questions: "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with sepsis?", "If patients with sepsis are administered corticosteroids, should high dose/short duration or low dose/long duration be used?", "Should corticosteroids compared with no corticosteroids be used in patients with ARDS?", "Should methylprednisolone be used over other corticosteroids in patients with ARDS?", and "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with CAP?". Populations are specified as "All adult and pediatric patients with sepsis", "All adult and pediatric patients with ARDS", and "All adult and pediatric patients with CAP", with interventions and comparators including "Corticosteroids", "Placebo or no corticosteroids", and for methylprednisolone the comparators "Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone", with outcomes referenced in supplemental material.

### Corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: the path we choose depends on where we want to get [^1123CUW6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of admission to intensive care units and its mortality rates remain exceedingly high. In the search for adjunctive therapies, clinicians who were encouraged by available, though limited, evidence prescribed steroids in most patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, including those with community-acquired pneumonia. Current evidence demonstrates that, whereas corticosteroids should not be routinely employed as adjuvant therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, there is sufficient equipoise to continue studying the use of corticosteroids.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Recommendation: 2A) We "suggest" administering corticosteroids to adult critically ill patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Remark: We make no recommendation for corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with ARDS. Evidence summary: Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in adult hospitalized patients with ARDS; Twelve (67%) used American-European Consensus Conference or Berlin criteria and 6 (33%) included patients with COVID-19; corticosteroid use probably reduces 28-day mortality (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95, moderate certainty) in critically ill patients with ARDS.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and the risk of pneumonia in people with asthma: a case-control study [^115rpzjk]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical trials, the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in people with COPD, but whether the same is true for people with asthma is not known.

Methods

With the use of primary care data from The Health Improvement Network, we identified people with asthma, and from this cohort, we identified patients with pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection and age- and sex-matched control subjects. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the association between the dose and type of inhaled corticosteroid and the risk of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection.

Results

A dose-response relationship was found between the strength of inhaled corticosteroid dose and risk of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (P < .001 for trend) such that after adjusting for confounders, people receiving the highest strength of inhaled corticosteroid (≥ 1,000 μg) had a 2.04 (95% CI, 1.59–2.64) increased risk of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection compared with those with asthma who did not have a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids within the previous 90 days.

Conclusions

People with asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids are at an increased risk of pneumonia or lower respiratory infection, with those receiving higher doses being at greater risk. Pneumonia should be considered as a possible side effect of inhaled corticosteroids, and the lowest possible dose of inhaled corticosteroids should be used in the management of asthma.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^115hu1Sb]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Few studies have evaluated the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). On the basis of their results, the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP should be categorized as a weak recommendation (two studies) and a strong recommendation (two studies) with either low- or moderate-quality evidence.

- No evidence of adverse outcomes or harm is present in the studies that evaluated the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP. Thus, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma receiving antimicrobial therapy for severe CAP, concomitant administration of moderate doses of systemic corticosteroids may be considered safe.

- In view of the recent results of the CORTICUS (Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock) study, which evaluated the use of corticosteroids in septic shock, future randomized controlled trials should overcome the methodological flaws in the designs of the currently available studies. To determine the risks and benefits of adding corticosteroids to the treatment of patients with severe CAP, large prospective randomized studies involving a more homogeneous group of patients are necessary.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^117HweE8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide despite correct antibiotic use. Severe disease not only manifests frequently and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, but also presents with the highest mortality. Death in severe CAP occurs due to an overwhelming pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that causes abnormal gas exchange (i.e. respiratory failure), sepsis, and multiple-organ dysfunction. Although antimicrobials are highly effective at reducing the bacterial burden of pulmonary infection, they do not directly modulate the inflammatory response.

Poor clinical outcomes in severe CAP necessitate treatment strategies other than antibiotics. Corticosteroids are a biologically plausible option that inhibit the expression and action of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response associated with pneumonia. However, their use in CAP has yielded heterogeneous survival results in randomized clinical trials, in part because they included patients with and without severe CAP, precluding their routine inclusion in therapeutic strategies. Appropriate selection of patients with severe CAP only, in whom the beneficial effects of corticosteroids outweigh the potential adverse effects, is therefore of major relevance. Indeed, subgroup analyses of patients treated for CAP with corticosteroids have shown survival benefits mainly in those with severe disease. This is plausible because the low mortality in patients without severe CAP makes it less likely that we will observe reduced mortality. Given that the rationale for corticosteroid use is to attenuate the inflammatory response, those with the highest inflammatory status should obtain the most benefit. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe CAP and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, corticosteroid use led to less late radiographic progression of pulmonary opacities. However, this study was underpowered for assessing differences in mortality and other clinical outcomes.

We hypothesize that corticosteroids might improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP and high inflammatory responses by reducing pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Accordingly, we aimed to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and other outcomes in patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

Materials and methods

Search strategy and data sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024, with no language restrictions, using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms related to community-acquired pneumonia and corticosteroids (including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). The search strategy was developed by an experienced researcher and is detailed in Table S1. In addition, we conducted a manual search of the references cited in the included studies to identify any other potentially relevant research. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024544342) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Study selection

The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) Population: Severe CAP; (2) Intervention: Corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, were administered at dosages designed to distinguish between low-to-moderate and high doses. Low-to-moderate doses were defined as < 1 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone or < 80 mg per day of methylprednisolone or its equivalent, whereas doses equal to or exceeding either threshold were classified as high doses; (3) Comparison: Placebo; (4) Outcomes: The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, the secondary efficacy outcome was MV, and the safety outcome was the incidence of SAEs; and (5) study design: RCTs. Severe CAP was defined as CAP that required admission to the ICU or met the criteria established by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA), or PaO2/FiO2 < 300, or pneumonia severity index score ≥ IV. Only data from the subgroup with severe CAP were included if the studies enrolled patients with different severity levels of CAP. In additionally, we excluded non-RCTs, duplicate publications, conference reports, and studies with incomplete data.

Two authors screened the study titles and abstracts to establish eligibility and conducted rigorous preliminary selection. Subsequently, the full text was reviewed based on the inclusion criteria, leading to further exclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consulting with a third independent researcher.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted pertinent demographic data and study outcomes, including all-cause mortality, need for MV, and SAEs. Additionally, we categorized the included trials based on the treatment dosage and duration.
