## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of candidiasis in adults (esophageal)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating esophageal candidiasis in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line agent and its standard dosing. Then, I should verify the loading dose and maintenance strategy. Next, I will check the acceptable dose range and duration, including the "treat for at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution" rule. After that, I need to consider alternatives for patients who cannot take oral therapy or who have fluconazole-refractory disease. Finally, I should review suppressive therapy for recurrent disease and special populations, and then synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the first-line therapy and standard regimen. Fluconazole is the preferred agent for esophageal candidiasis in adults, with a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily, typically for 14–21 days, and doses up to 400 mg/day may be used based on clinical response; treatment should continue for at least 3 weeks total and for at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution to reduce relapse risk [^bb1d510f] [^4d1eea57] [^f5de839b] [^eb19bc7b].

> Wait, let me verify the loading dose and pharmacokinetic rationale. The 200 mg day-1 load achieves near steady-state by day 2 because oral and IV fluconazole are bioequivalent, which supports using the same milligram dose whether given orally or intravenously; this is consistent across FDA labeling and IDSA guidance, so I should not overthink switching routes if oral intake is compromised [^eb19bc7b] [^2568fb2e] [^bb1d510f].

> I should confirm the dose range and when to escalate. While 100 mg daily is the usual maintenance dose, IDSA allows 200–400 mg daily (about 3–6 mg/kg) for 14–21 days based on severity and response; the FDA label similarly notes doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, so escalation is reasonable for severe disease or slower response, but I need to ensure I do not exceed 400 mg/day without a compelling reason [^bb1d510f] [^f5de839b] [^eb19bc7b].

> Hold on, I should verify the duration rules. The minimum treatment duration is 14 days, but many patients require 21 days, and the key is to treat for at least 2 weeks after symptoms resolve; this helps prevent relapse, which is especially important in immunocompromised hosts, so I should anchor duration to symptom resolution rather than a fixed stop date [^bb1d510f] [^4d1eea57] [^f5de839b].

> Next, I should review alternatives for patients who cannot take oral therapy. Intravenous fluconazole 400 mg daily is acceptable, or an echinocandin such as micafungin 150 mg daily, caspofungin 70 mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg loading dose then 100 mg daily; I initially thought anidulafungin was 100 mg load then 50 mg daily, but wait, that 100→50 mg regimen pertains to invasive candidiasis, not esophageal disease, so for esophageal candidiasis the correct regimen is 200 mg load then 100 mg daily, and I should correct that now to avoid confusion [^bb1d510f] [^91270c54] [^df34b6d7] [^2819889a].

> I will now examine fluconazole-refractory disease. For azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis, itraconazole solution 200 mg daily or voriconazole 200 mg twice daily (oral or IV) for 14–21 days are recommended; echinocandins are also effective alternatives, though relapse rates may be higher than with fluconazole, so I should counsel patients accordingly and consider suppressive therapy if recurrences occur [^bb1d510f] [^1891780d] [^9ea9281d] [^f062f7f5].

> Let me consider suppressive therapy for recurrent esophagitis. In patients with frequent or severe recurrences, chronic suppressive fluconazole 100–200 mg three times weekly is recommended; I should also remember to reassess the need for suppression as immune status improves, particularly in people with HIV in whom immune reconstitution on ART reduces recurrence risk [^bb1d510f] [^996e1c91] [^048ae212].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has special circumstances. In pregnancy, especially the first trimester, systemic azoles should be avoided due to teratogenic risk; amphotericin B is preferred for invasive or refractory disease, and any suppressive azole should be discontinued if pregnancy is recognized, so I need to screen for pregnancy and adjust therapy accordingly [^bb95ccda] [^27b9289c].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations briefly to ensure internal consistency. Children 6 months and older generally receive fluconazole 6 mg/kg on day 1 followed by 3 mg/kg once daily, with doses up to 12 mg/kg/day permitted, and a minimum of 3 weeks of therapy including at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution; this pediatric framework aligns with the adult principle of adequate duration and response-guided dosing, which reinforces the adult approach I am recommending [^cc976d6f] [^d852d1f2].

> Let me synthesize the final, clinically actionable recommendation. For adults with esophageal candidiasis, give fluconazole 200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg once daily for 14–21 days, ensuring at least 3 weeks total and at least 2 weeks after symptom resolution; escalate to 200–400 mg daily if disease is severe or response is suboptimal, and consider IV fluconazole 400 mg daily or an echinocandin if oral therapy is not feasible; for fluconazole-refractory disease, use itraconazole solution 200 mg daily or voriconazole 200 mg twice daily, or an echinocandin, recognizing higher relapse risk with echinocandins; for recurrent disease, consider suppressive fluconazole 100–200 mg three times weekly while monitoring immune status and minimizing unnecessary azole exposure [^bb1d510f] [^4d1eea57] [^f5de839b] [^1891780d] [^996e1c91].

---

The recommended dosage for esophageal candidiasis in adults is **fluconazole 200 mg orally or intravenously on day 1, then 100 mg daily for 14–21 days** [^bb1d510f] [^f5de839b]. If oral therapy is not tolerated, use **IV fluconazole 400 mg daily** [^91270c54] or an echinocandin (micafungin 150 mg daily, caspofungin 70 mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg loading dose then 100 mg daily) [^bb1d510f] [^df34b6d7] [^2819889a]. Treat for a minimum of 14 days and at least 7 days after symptom resolution; for severe or refractory cases, fluconazole can be increased to 400 mg daily [^bb1d510f] [^f5de839b]. For fluconazole-refractory disease, use itraconazole solution 200 mg daily [^1891780d], voriconazole 200 mg twice daily [^9ea9281d], or an echinocandin for 14–21 days [^bb1d510f].

---

## First-line therapy: fluconazole

- **Loading dose**: 200 mg orally or intravenously on day 1 [^f5de839b] [^9e6d10e0].
- **Maintenance dose**: 100 mg orally or intravenously once daily for 14–21 days [^bb1d510f] [^2649bd31].
- **Maximum dose**: 400 mg daily for severe or refractory cases [^bb1d510f] [^f5de839b].
- **Duration**: Minimum 14 days and at least 7 days after symptom resolution [^bb1d510f] [^6f70da53].

## Alternative therapy for patients unable to tolerate oral therapy

For patients unable to take oral therapy, **intravenous fluconazole 400 mg daily** is recommended [^91270c54] [^bb1d510f]. Alternatively, echinocandins may be used with the following dosing:

| **Echinocandin** | **Loading dose** | **Maintenance dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Micafungin | None | 150 mg IV daily [^289aec2e] |
| Caspofungin | 70 mg IV on day 1 | 50 mg IV daily [^2819889a] |
| Anidulafungin | 200 mg IV on day 1 | 100 mg IV daily [^df34b6d7] |

---

## Management of fluconazole-refractory disease

For fluconazole-refractory esophageal candidiasis, **alternative antifungal agents** include:

- **Itraconazole solution**: 200 mg orally once daily for 14–21 days [^1891780d] [^69e84a38].
- **Voriconazole**: 200 mg orally or intravenously twice daily for 14–21 days [^9ea9281d] [^04abe554].
- **Echinocandins**: Micafungin 150 mg IV daily, caspofungin 70 mg loading dose then 50 mg IV daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg loading dose then 100 mg IV daily for 14–21 days [^bb1d510f] [^df34b6d7].

---

## Special considerations

- **HIV-positive patients**: Systemic antifungal therapy is required; fluconazole remains first-line therapy [^25054a42] [^2649bd31].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid systemic azoles, especially fluconazole, in the first trimester; use topical therapy or amphotericin B if necessary [^bb95ccda] [^27b9289c].
- **Pediatric patients**: Fluconazole 6 mg/kg on day 1, then 3 mg/kg daily for 14–21 days; doses up to 12 mg/kg/day may be used in severe cases [^cc976d6f] [^d852d1f2].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage and Administration in Adults:

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline—esophageal candidiasis treatment emphasizes systemic therapy, preferred dosing, parenteral options, de-escalation, refractory regimens, and recurrence suppression. Systemic antifungal therapy is always required and a diagnostic trial before endoscopy is appropriate (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily, for 14–21 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For patients unable to take oral therapy, intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, or an echinocandin—micafungin 150 mg daily, caspofungin 70-mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, or anidulafungin 100 mg daily—is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), with AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.7 mg/kg daily, a less preferred alternative (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Consider de-escalating to oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily once the patient is able to tolerate oral intake (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For fluconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution, 200 mg daily, or voriconazole, 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily either intravenous or oral, for 14–21 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), with echinocandins for 14–21 days as alternatives (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Posaconazole suspension, 400 mg twice daily, or extended-release tablets, 300 mg once daily, could be considered for fluconazole-refractory disease (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who have recurrent esophagitis, chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole, 100–200 mg 3 times weekly, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- Antifungal medications come in different forms: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:
- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7-14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^2a6b33c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2b0a5637]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Esophageal candidiasis—adults and adolescents with HIV: Systemic antifungals are required (AI), with a 14-day to 21-day course of either fluconazole (oral or intravenous [IV]) or oral itraconazole solution recommended (AI); because itraconazole capsules may be less effective than fluconazole due to variable absorption, oral or IV fluconazole remains the preferred therapy (AI). For those with severe symptoms who may have difficulty swallowing, oral fluconazole suspension should be considered. Isavuconazole is an alternative (BI): a 2-week course given orally at an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by 100 mg once daily (BI) or 400 mg once daily is as effective as fluconazole for uncomplicated esophageal candidiasis, though a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse effects was seen with the 100-mg, once-daily isavuconazole regimen than with fluconazole and the other isavuconazole regimens. Other alternatives (BI) include posaconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B (lipid formulations), and the echinocandins caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, but esophageal candidiasis appears to have a higher relapse rate after treatment with the echinocandins (BI). A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of antifungal therapy is usually warranted before endoscopy; in those who do not respond within 7 days, endoscopy is recommended to identify other causes or drug-resistant Candida (AII).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage and Administration in Adults

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for the treatment of infections should be based on the infecting organism and the patient’s response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study of micafungin compared with fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients [^f30a1bcd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Severely immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to Candida infection of the esophagus. This randomized, double-blind study assessed the dose-response relationship of the new echinocandin antifungal, micafungin, compared with that of standard fluconazole treatment.

Methods

A total of 245 patients (age, > or =18 years) with a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and esophageal candidiasis, confirmed by endoscopy and culture, were randomized to receive micafungin (50, 100, or 150 mg per day) or fluconazole (200 mg per day). Both agents were administered once per day by a 1-h intravenous infusion for 14-21 days. The primary efficacy end point was endoscopic cure rate, defined as endoscopy grade of 0 at the end of therapy.

Results

The endoscopic cure rate (grade 0) was dose-dependent with 50, 100, and 150 mg of micafungin per day at 68.8%, 77.4%, and 89.8%, respectively. Symptoms improved or resolved rapidly (3-7 days of treatment in the majority of patients). The endoscopic cure rate for 100 and 150 mg of micafungin per day (83.5%) was comparable to that for 200 mg of fluconazole per day (86.7%; 95% confidence interval for the difference in endoscopic cure rate, -14.0% to 7.7%). The overall safety and tolerability was acceptable, with no important differences between micafungin (all doses) and fluconazole.

Conclusions

The dose-response findings demonstrate a greater efficacy with micafungin at 100 and 150 mg per day than at 50 mg per day. This study also indicates that the efficacy of micafungin (at dosages of 100 and 150 mg per day) was comparable to that of fluconazole, suggesting that micafungin represents a valuable new treatment option for esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Esophageal candidiasis—systemic antifungal therapy and diagnostic steps are specified: Systemic antifungals are required for effective treatment of esophageal candidiasis (AI). A 14-day to 21-day course of either fluconazole (oral or intravenous [IV]) or oral itraconazole solution is highly effective (AI). As with oropharyngeal candidiasis, itraconazole capsules for esophageal candidiasis are less effective than fluconazole because of variable absorption (CII). A 2-week course of the newer triazole isavuconazole, given orally at an initial loading dose of 200 mg, followed by 50 mg once daily; or a loading dose of 400 mg followed by 100 mg once daily; or 400 mg once weekly, is also as effective as fluconazole for uncomplicated esophageal candidiasis (BI); a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse effects was seen with the 100-mg, once-daily isavuconazole regimen than with fluconazole and the other isavuconazole regimens. Voriconazole, amphotericin B (either deoxycholate or lipid formulations), and the echinocandins caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin all effectively treat esophageal candidiasis (BI); however, esophageal candidiasis appears to have a higher relapse rate after treatment with the echinocandins. Therefore, oral or IV fluconazole remains the preferred therapy for esophageal candidiasis (AI). Although infection with other pathogens can mimic esophageal candidiasis, a diagnostic and therapeutic trial of antifungal therapy is usually warranted before endoscopy, and in those who do not respond to antifungal therapy, endoscopy is recommended to identify different causes of esophagitis or drug-resistant Candida (AII).

### A randomized double-blind study of caspofungin versus amphotericin for the treatment of candidal esophagitis [^52750682]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Caspofungin is a new broad-spectrum antifungal drug. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of caspofungin relative to amphotericin B in adults with endoscopically documented symptomatic Candida esophagitis. By use of a modified intent-to-treat analysis, endoscopically verified clinical success was achieved in 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59%-86%) and 89% (95% CI, 72%-98%) of patients receiving caspofungin at 50 and 70 mg/day, respectively, and in 63% (95% CI, 49%-76%) of patients given amphotericin B at 0.5 mg/kg/day. Therapy was stopped because of drug-related adverse events in 24% of patients in the amphotericin B group and 4% and 7%, respectively, for the caspofungin groups. This report provides the first demonstration of clinical utility for an echinocandin compound. Caspofungin appeared in this study to be as effective as and better tolerated than amphotericin B for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f062f7f5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Esophageal candidiasis—evidence summary indicates it typically occurs at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease, and in immunocompromised hosts the presence of oropharyngeal candidiasis with dysphagia or odynophagia is frequently predictive of esophageal candidiasis. A therapeutic trial with fluconazole is a cost-effective alternative to endoscopic examination, and most patients improve or have symptom resolution within 7 days after starting antifungal therapy. Most cases are caused by C. albicans, though symptomatic infections due to C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. krusei have been described. Fluconazole is superior to ketoconazole, itraconazole capsules, and flucytosine and is comparable to itraconazole solution; voriconazole is as efficacious as fluconazole and has been shown to be useful in fluconazole-refractory mucosal infections. The echinocandins are as effective as fluconazole but have higher relapse rates, so higher doses of echinocandins are recommended for esophageal disease than for candidemia to decrease relapse. Fluconazole-refractory disease responds to caspofungin, and micafungin and anidulafungin are likely as effective. Effective antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic decline in prevalence and a marked diminution in refractory cases; in patients with advanced AIDS, recurrent infections are common and long-term suppressive therapy with fluconazole is effective in decreasing recurrence rates.

2.1	Important Administration Instructions for Use in All Patients

Administer CANCIDAS by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 1 hour. Do not administer CANCIDAS by IV bolus administration.

2.2	Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients [18 years of age and older]

The dosage and duration of CANCIDAS treatment for each indication are as follows:

Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients

Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. Continue empirical therapy until resolution of neutropenia. In general, treat patients found to have a fungal infection for a minimum of 14 days after the last positive culture and continue treatment for at least 7 days after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms are resolved. If the 50-mg dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg.

Candidemia and Other Candida Infections

Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be dictated by the patient's clinical and microbiological response. In general, continue antifungal therapy for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. Patients with neutropenia who remain persistently neutropenic may warrant a longer course of therapy pending resolution of the neutropenia.

Esophageal Candidiasis

The dose is 50 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days after symptom resolution. A 70-mg loading dose has not been studied for this indication. Because of the risk of relapse of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with HIV infections, suppressive oral therapy could be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Invasive Aspergillosis

Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based upon the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.

Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis—evidence summary in HIV and refractory disease: In HIV-infected patients, oropharyngeal candidiasis is most often observed with CD4 counts <200 cells/μL, and recurrent infections typically occur in those with low CD4 cell counts (<50 cells/μL). In a multicenter randomized study, 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal miconazole applied once daily was as effective as 10-mg clotrimazole troches used 5 times daily. Fluconazole tablets and itraconazole solution are superior to ketoconazole and itraconazole capsules, and posaconazole suspension is also as efficacious as fluconazole in patients with AIDS. Posaconazole, 100-mg delayed release tablets, given as 300 mg daily as a single dose, are FDA approved for the prophylaxis of fungal infections in high-risk patients and provide a stable bioavailability (approximately 55%). For fluconazole-refractory infections, itraconazole solution results show that between 64% and 80% of patients will respond to this therapy; posaconazole suspension is efficacious in approximately 75% of patients with refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, and intravenous caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin have been shown to be effective alternatives to azole agents.

Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis—If oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) initially is treated topically, failure or relapse should be treated with oral fluconazole or itraconazole oral solution (strong, high). Approximately 50% to 60% of patients with fluconazole-refractory OPC and 80% of patients with fluconazole-refractory esophageal candidiasis will respond to itraconazole solution (weak, moderate). Posaconazole has been effective in adults with HIV infection who have azole-refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis; however, experience in children is limited, an appropriate dosage for children aged <13 years has not been defined, and data in children are insufficient to recommend its use in children with HIV infection (weak, low). An Amphotericin B dose of 1 mL given orally four times daily of a 100-mg/mL suspension sometimes has been effective for OPC not responding to itraconazole solution, but this product is not available in the United States (weak, low). Low-dose IV amphotericin B (0.3–0.5 mg/kg/day) has been effective in children with refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis (strong, moderate). Given their excellent safety profile, echinocandins could be considered for treatment of azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis (weak, moderate), although data in children with and without HIV infection are limited.

Echinocandins—spectrum, administration, and outcomes: Caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin are available only as parenteral preparations, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the echinocandins are low for most Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei; however, recent case series have described treatment failures with resistant strains of C. glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis demonstrates innately higher MICs, raising concern it may be less responsive. Each of these agents has been studied for esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis and has demonstrated efficacy, and pooled randomized-trial analyses in almost exclusively nonneutropenic patients suggest a survival advantage associated with initial echinocandin therapy. All echinocandins have minimal adverse effects, are administered once daily intravenously, and achieve therapeutic concentrations in all infection sites with the exception of the eye, CNS, and urine.

### Fluconazole in sodium chloride [^da5a9a8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

Systemic Candida infections

For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis

For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

Cryptococcal meningitis

The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated mucosal candidiasis—managing treatment failure: Antifungal treatment failure is typically defined as persistence of signs or symptoms after 7 to 14 days of appropriate therapy and occurs in approximately 4% to 5% of patients with HIV infection who have oral or esophageal candidiasis, typically those with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3; confirmatory culture and, for esophageal candidiasis, endoscopy are necessary to confirm azole resistance or other causes. For azole-refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, posaconazole immediate-release oral suspension 400 mg twice daily for 28 days is effective in 75% (AI); oral itraconazole solution is effective, at least transiently, in approximately two-thirds (BII); and azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis can be treated with anidulafungin (BII), caspofungin (BII), micafungin (BII), or voriconazole (BII). IV amphotericin B is usually effective for refractory disease (BII), and both amphotericin B deoxycholate and lipid preparations have been used successfully (BII); an amphotericin B oral suspension (1 mL of the 100-mg/mL suspension four times daily) is sometimes effective for itraconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis (BII) but is not commercially available in the United States.

Dosage and Administration in Children

The following dose equivalency scheme should generally provide equivalent exposure in pediatric and adult patients:

* Some older children may have clearances similar to that of adults. Absolute doses exceeding 600 mg/day are not recommended.

Experience with fluconazole in neonates is limited to pharmacokinetic studies in premature newborns. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .) Based on the prolonged half-life seen in premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), these children, in the first two weeks of life, should receive the same dosage (mg/kg) as in older children, but administered every 72 hours. After the first two weeks, these children should be dosed once daily. No information regarding fluconazole pharmacokinetics in full-term newborns is available.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis

The recommended dosage of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for oropharyngeal candidiasis in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Treatment should be administered for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis

For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Doses up to 12 mg/kg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following the resolution of symptoms.

### Caspofungin acetate (Cancidas) [^a5921d01]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the efficacy data for CANCIDAS in neutropenic patients with candidemia were limited. In a separate compassionate use study, 4 patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis received prolonged therapy with CANCIDAS following other long-term antifungal therapy; three of these patients had a favorable response.

In a second randomized, double-blind study, 197 patients with proven invasive candidiasis received CANCIDAS 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1) or CANCIDAS 150 mg/day. The diagnostic criteria, evaluation time points, and efficacy endpoints were similar to those employed in the prior study. Patients with Candida endocarditis, meningitis, or osteomyelitis were excluded. Although this study was designed to compare the safety of the two doses, it was not large enough to detect differences in rare or unexpected adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . The efficacy of CANCIDAS at the 150 mg daily dose was not significantly better than the efficacy of the 50-mg daily dose of CANCIDAS. The efficacy of doses higher than 50 mg daily in the other adult patients for whom CANCIDAS is indicated has not been evaluated.

14.3	Esophageal Candidiasis (and information on oropharyngeal candidiasis)

The safety and efficacy of CANCIDAS in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis was evaluated in one large, controlled, noninferiority, clinical trial and two smaller dose-response studies.

In all 3 studies, patients were required to have symptoms and microbiological documentation of esophageal candidiasis; most patients had advanced AIDS (with CD4 counts <50/mm3).

Of the 166 patients in the large study who had culture-confirmed esophageal candidiasis at baseline, 120 had Candida albicans and 2 had Candida tropicalis as the sole baseline pathogen whereas 44 had mixed baseline cultures containing C. albicans and one or more additional Candida species.

In the large, randomized, double-blind study comparing CANCIDAS 50 mg/day versus intravenous fluconazole 200 mg/day for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, patients were treated for an average of 9 days (range 7-21 days). Favorable overall response at 5 to 7 days following discontinuation of study therapy required both complete resolution of symptoms and significant endoscopic improvement. The definition of endoscopic response was based on severity of disease at baseline using a 4-grade scale and required at least a two-grade reduction from baseline endoscopic score or reduction to grade 0 for patients with a baseline score of 2 or less.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis—treatment in adults and adolescents with HIV states that oral fluconazole is as effective as or superior to topical therapy, and oral fluconazole at 100 to 200 mg once a day is considered the drug of choice to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis except during pregnancy (AI), with one to 2 weeks of therapy until resolution of infection recommended. As alternatives, once-daily miconazole in 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal tablets (BI) or five-times-per-day clotrimazole troches (BI) can be used and were shown to be equivalent in a multicenter, randomized study; nystatin suspension four times daily remains an additional alternative (BII). If esophageal involvement is suspected, topical therapy alone is not recommended (AI). Additional systemic options include oral itraconazole for 7 to 14 days, which is as effective as oral fluconazole but less well tolerated, and posaconazole oral suspension, which is also as effective as fluconazole and generally better tolerated than itraconazole solution but is more expensive.

### A randomized, double-blind trial of anidulafungin versus fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis [^12af477e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Anidulafungin is a novel antifungal agent of the echinocandin class. This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous anidulafungin to that of oral fluconazole in 601 patients with endoscopically and microbiologically documented esophageal candidiasis. Patients received intravenous anidulafungin (100 mg on day 1, followed by 50 mg per day) or oral fluconazole (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg per day) for 7 days beyond resolution of symptoms (range, 14-21 days). At the end of therapy, the rate of endoscopic success for anidulafungin (242 [97.2%] of 249 treated patients) was found to be statistically noninferior to that for fluconazole (252 [98.8%] of 255 treated patients; treatment difference, -1.6%; 95% confidence interval, -4.1 to 0.8). The safety profile of anidulafungin was similar to that of fluconazole; treatment-related adverse events occurred in 9.3% and 12.0% of patients, respectively. Laboratory parameters were similar between treatment arms. Anidulafungin is as safe and effective as oral fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, when assessed at the completion of therapy.

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of voriconazole and fluconazole were compared in 391 immunocompromised patients with mycology- and biopsy-proven esophageal candidiasis. Primary efficacy analysis (256 patients) of esophageal treatment as assessed by esophagoscopy revealed success rates of 98.3% with voriconazole and 95.1% with fluconazole. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in success rates ranged from -1.0% to 7.5%. The overall safety and tolerability of both antifungals were acceptable. Fewer patients discontinued voriconazole treatment because of insufficient clinical response (4 patients [2.0%] vs. 5 patients [2.6%]). More patients discontinued voriconazole than fluconazole treatment because of laboratory test abnormalities (7 patients [3.5%] vs. 2 patients [1.0%]) or treatment-related adverse events (5 patients [2.5%] vs. 1 patient [0.5%]). The most frequent adverse events (23%) with voriconazole were mild, transient visual disturbances. Voriconazole (200 mg, b.i.d.) was shown to be at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of biopsy-proven esophageal candidiasis in immunocompromised patients.

### Caspofungin: an echinocandin antifungal agent [^b2c02987]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The mainstays of treatment for nosocomial fungal infections have been amphotericin B and azole derivatives. Caspofungin acetate is a new echinocandin antifungal agent with a mechanism of action that targets a structural component of the fungal cell wall.

Objective

This article describes the pharmacologic properties and potential clinical usefulness of caspofungin.

Methods

Relevant information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-September 2001). Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-September 2001), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2001), as well as meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996-2001), using the terms caspofungin, MK-0991, pneumocandin, echinocandin, candin, and beta-(1,3)-glucan inhibitor.

Results

In vitro, caspofungin exhibits antifungal activity against an array of clinically important yeasts and molds, including Candida and Aspergillus spp. The proposed susceptibility breakpoint for caspofungin against Candida spp, the most common cause of nosocomial fungal infections, is a minimum inhibitory concentration of < or =1 microg/mL. In humans, caspofungin has a volume of distribution of 9.67 L, is extensively bound to albumin (97%), has a plasma elimination half-life of 9 to 11 hours, and is metabolized to inactive metabolites in the liver. Dose adjustment based on age, sex, race, or renal function does not appear to be necessary, although patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 7-9) should receive a lower maintenance dose. The results of clinical trials, although somewhat preliminary, suggest that caspofungin is effective in the treatment of esophageal and oropharyngeal candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis. When combined with other antifungal agents, caspofungin produces a synergistic or additive effect against a variety of clinically important fungi. The most commonly reported adverse events with caspofungin have included fever, infusion-related reactions, headache, nausea, elevations in liver transaminase levels, and histamine-type reactions. The recommended dosage in adults is 70 mg IV on day 1 followed by 50 mg/d, with the duration of treatment depending on the severity of the patient's underlying condition and the clinical response.

Conclusion

Although additional studies are needed, caspofungin appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of patients with difficult-to-treat or life-threatening fungal infections.

Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Children With and Exposed to HIV—preventing recurrence of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC)—notes that secondary prophylaxis of recurrent OPC is not routinely recommended because treatment of recurrence is typically effective and due to concerns including drug-drug interactions, resistance, and cost (strong, moderate). When recurrences are frequent and severe, secondary prophylaxis may be considered on a case-by-case scenario, and data from adults with HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) suggest that suppressive systemic azoles, either oral fluconazole or itraconazole solution, can be effective (weak, moderate). Experience in adults further suggests that, after initial fluconazole-refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis responds to voriconazole, posaconazole or echinocandins, continuation of the effective drug as secondary prophylaxis until ART produces immune reconstitution can be effective (weak, low).

Background

Candida esophagitis remains an important cause of morbidity in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Fluconazole is widely regarded as the treatment of choice for this condition.

Methods

The efficacy and safety of caspofungin were compared with fluconazole in adult patients with Candida esophagitis in a double-blind randomized trial. Eligible patients had symptoms compatible with esophagitis, endoscopic demonstration of mucosal plaques, and microscopic demonstration of Candida from the esophageal lesions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive caspofungin (50 mg) or fluconazole (200 mg) intravenously once daily for 7 to 21 days. The primary endpoint was the combined response of symptom resolution and significant endoscopic improvement 5 to 7 days after discontinuation of treatment. Data were analyzed with a modified intention-to-treat analysis, which excluded 2 ineligible patients.

Results

Most patients (154/177; 87%) had HIV infection, with a median CD4 count of 30 cells/mm(3). Candida albicans was the predominant isolate. Favorable response rates were achieved in 66 (81%) of the 81 patients in the caspofungin arm and in 80 (85%) of the 94 patients in the fluconazole arm (difference = -4%; 95% confidence interval: -15% to +8%). Symptoms had resolved in >50% of patients in both groups by the fifth day of treatment. No patient in the caspofungin group developed a serious drug-related adverse event; therapy was only discontinued in 1 patient (receiving fluconazole) due to a drug-related adverse experience. Four weeks after stopping study drug, symptoms had recurred in 18 (28%) of 64 patients given caspofungin and in 12 (17%) of 72 patients given fluconazole (P = 0.19).

Conclusions

In this study, caspofungin appeared to be as efficacious and generally as well tolerated as fluconazole in patients with advanced HIV infection and documented Candida esophagitis.

Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis—managing treatment failure in children with HIV infection: If oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) initially is treated topically, failure or relapse should be treated with oral fluconazole or itraconazole oral solution (strong, high); approximately 50% to 60% of patients with fluconazole-refractory OPC and 80% with fluconazole-refractory esophageal candidiasis will respond to itraconazole solution (weak, moderate); posaconazole experience in children is limited and an appropriate dosage for children aged <13 years has not been defined, so data are insufficient to recommend its use in children with HIV infection (weak, low); an Amphotericin B dose of 1 mL given orally four times daily of a 100-mg/mL suspension sometimes has been effective for OPC unresponsive to itraconazole solution but is not available in the United States (weak, low); low-dose IV amphotericin B (0.3–0.5 mg/kg/day) has been effective in children with refractory OPC or esophageal candidiasis (strong, moderate); and given their excellent safety profile, echinocandins could be considered for azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis (weak, moderate).

Objective

To review the pharmacology, mycology, chemistry, in vitro susceptibility, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosage, and administration of micafungin, an echinocandin antifungal agent.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English language, was conducted from 1978 to November 2003. Supplementary sources included program abstracts from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and the Infectious Diseases Society of America from 1996 to 2003 and information available through the manufacturer's Web site.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

In vitro and preclinical studies, as well as Phase II and III clinical trials, were evaluated to summarize the clinical efficacy and safety of micafungin. All published and unpublished trials and abstracts citing micafungin were selected.

Data Synthesis

Micafungin has shown in vitro activity against many yeasts and a variety of molds. Micafungin can be administered only parenterally. Efficacy has been illustrated in open noncomparative studies of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients and in comparative trials as antifungal prophylaxis in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Adverse events appear mild and limited; the most commonly reported adverse events include hyperbilirubinemia, nausea, and diarrhea.

Conclusions

Micafungin has activity against Aspergillus spp. and a variety of Candida spp., including azole-resistant strains. Micafungin demonstrates efficacy in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients and appears superior to fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on case reports and in vitro efficacy, micafungin may prove to be a clinically useful agent in the treatment of other fungal diseases; however, these indications await the results of clinical trials.

Pediatric Use

Use in Pediatric Patients for the Treatment of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis

An open-label, randomized, controlled trial has shown fluconazole to be effective in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in pediatric patients 6 months to 13 years of age. (See CLINICAL STUDIES.)

Use in Pediatric Patients for the Treatment of Candida Esophagitis, Systemic Candida Infections, or Cryptococcal Meningitis

The use of fluconazole in pediatric patients with cryptococcal meningitis, Candida esophagitis, or systemic Candida infections is supported by the efficacy shown for these indications in adults and by the results from several small noncomparative pediatric clinical studies. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) have established a dose proportionality between pediatric patients and adults. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

In a noncomparative study of fluconazole administered to pediatric patients (from birth to less than 17 years) with serious systemic fungal infections, most of which were candidemia, the effectiveness of fluconazole was similar to that reported for the treatment of candidemia in adults. Of 17 subjects with culture-confirmed candidemia, 11 of 14 (79%) with baseline symptoms (3 were asymptomatic) had a clinical cure; 13/15 (87%) of evaluable patients had a mycologic cure at the end of treatment but two of these patients relapsed at 10 and 18 days, respectively, following cessation of therapy.

When to start suppressive therapy—among people with HIV who had CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3, a randomized clinical trial documented significantly fewer episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other invasive fungal infections with continuous fluconazole therapy (three times a week) than with episodic treatment; this trial also demonstrated no difference in the risk of clinically significant fluconazole resistance between the two fluconazole-treated groups among patients who were receiving ART. However, secondary prophylaxis for recurrent oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis is not recommended by most HIV specialists unless people have frequent or severe recurrences (CIII). If recurrences are frequent or severe, oral fluconazole can be used as suppressive therapy for oropharyngeal (BI), esophageal (BI), or vulvovaginal (AII) candidiasis. Oral posaconazole twice daily is also effective for esophageal candidiasis (BII). The potential for development of secondary azole resistance should be considered when contemplating chronic maintenance therapy using azoles in people with HIV who are severely immunocompromised, and several important factors should be considered, including the effect of recurrences on well-being and quality of life, the need for prophylaxis against other fungal infections, cost, adverse events, and drug–drug interactions.

HIV-associated mucosal candidiasis—secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence: In a randomized clinical trial of patients with CD4 counts <150 cells/mm3, continuous fluconazole therapy (three times a week) produced significantly fewer episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other invasive fungal infections than episodic fluconazole for recurrences, and there was no difference in clinically significant fluconazole resistance among those receiving ART. Despite this, secondary prophylaxis for recurrent oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis is not recommended by most HIV specialists unless patients have frequent or severe recurrences (BIII). If recurrences are frequent or severe, oral fluconazole can be used as suppressive therapy for oropharyngeal (BI), esophageal (BI), or vulvovaginal (BII) candidiasis, and oral posaconazole twice daily is also effective for esophageal candidiasis (BII). The potential for development of secondary azole resistance should be considered with chronic azole maintenance; rates of relapse are high in patients with azole-refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis who have initially responded to echinocandins, voriconazole, or posaconazole therapy, and in such patients, secondary prophylaxis should be instituted until ART produces immune reconstitution (AIII).

Table 3—candidiasis in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children—management includes oropharyngeal and esophageal regimens: for oropharyngeal disease, first-choice options are fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) by mouth once daily, clotrimazole troches, 10-mg troche by mouth 4–5 times daily, or nystatin suspension 4–6 mL by mouth 4 times daily, or 1–2, 200,000-unit flavored pastilles by mouth 4–5 times daily; treatment duration is 7 to 14 days. For esophageal disease, first choice is fluconazole 6–12 mg/kg body weight by mouth once daily (maximum dose: 600 mg) or itraconazole oral solution, 2.5 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth twice daily; alternatives include oropharyngeal (fluconazole-refractory) itraconazole oral solution 2.5 mg/kg body weight/ dose by mouth twice daily (maximum 200–400 mg/ day) and esophageal disease amphotericin B (deoxycholate) 0.3–0.7 g/ kg body weight IV once daily. Itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably with itraconazole capsules and itraconazole capsules are generally ineffective for treatment of esophageal disease; central venous catheters should be removed, when feasible, in children with HIV with fungemia, and in uncomplicated catheter-associated C. albicans candidemia, an initial course of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole to complete treatment can be used.

Esophageal disease in children with HIV infection—Systemic therapy is essential for esophageal disease (strong, high) and should be initiated empirically in children with HIV infection who have OPC and esophageal symptoms; in most patients, symptoms should resolve within days after the start of effective therapy. Oral fluconazole for 14 to 21 days is highly effective for treatment of Candida esophagitis and is considered first line therapy (strong, high), while IV fluconazole, amphotericin B, or an echinocandin should be used for patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy. For fluconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution, posaconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, or an echinocandin are alternatives.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids (CS) represent a mainstay in the EoE therapy. Steroidal anti-inflammatory activity reduces esophageal fibrosis and remodeling and improves the integrity of the esophageal mucosal barrier.Both systemic and topical steroids are effective in inducing histological remission in patients of all ages with EoE,yet systemic administration causes non-negligible adverse effects (i.e. hyperphagia, weight gain, cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation, osteopenia, osteoporosis, oral and esophageal candidiasis, glucose intolerance and cataract formation)., In contrast, topical CS are not associated with relevant adverse events, except for esophageal candidiasis in 15% of patients, which could be promptly treated with orally administered antifungals. For these reasons, topical steroid therapy is recommended, and systemic administration should be avoided.Chemical formulations of topical CS include inhaled preparations (commercialized for the treatment of asthma), viscous suspensions, and effervescent tablets. Notably, topical CS are currently prescribed off-label, except for effervescent tablets of budesonide, which have been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of EoE in adults. Regardless of the method of delivery, the administration of topical CS should take place after a meal, and patients should avoid eating or drinking the following 30–60 min to minimize esophageal drug clearance.When taking inhaled preparations of steroids, patients should puff the medication into the mouth while holding the breath and then swallowing.Since histologic improvement depends on the CS mucosal contact time, viscous topical formulations and orodispersible tablets are considered the optimal delivery methods. Regarding children, recent guidelines suggest fluticasone propionate (FP) dosages of 880–1760 mcg/day for induction and 440–880 mcg/day for maintenance, and the suggested budesonide dosages are 1–2 mg/day for induction and 1 mg/day for maintenance.In adults, the suggested doses of FP are 1760 mcg/day for induction and 880–1760 mcg/day for maintenance. Regarding budesonide, a dose of 2–4 mg/day for induction and 2 mg/day during the maintenance period are considered adequate. Daily dosages of CS are usually administered in split doses.Lower dosages of viscous budesonide (2 mg/day) or fluticasone (1600 mcg/day) have been recently proposed for induction.It has been suggested that 3 months is an adequate timeframe to evaluate histologic response to induction with FP;further, it has been shown that the effectiveness of swallowed FP at inducing remission in children was greater in nonallergic and younger individualsand that higher levels of tryptase and eotaxin-3 were associated with steroid response (FP or budesonide).Several systematic reviews and meta-analysis have confirmed the effectiveness of CS at improving esophageal eosinophilic inflammation both in children and adults; – however, heterogeneity among studies in dosages, duration of treatments, administered steroids and methods of delivery, largely limit a comparative analysis.Regarding the improvement of symptoms during CS treatment compared with placebo, studies have shown contrasting results.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow’s solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

14.2	Esophageal Candidiasis

ERAXIS was evaluated in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized Phase 3 study. Three hundred patients received ERAXIS (100 mg loading dose IV on Day 1 followed by 50 mg/day IV) and 301 received oral fluconazole (200 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 100 mg/day). Treatment duration was 7 days beyond resolution of symptoms for a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 21 days.

Of the 442 patients with culture confirmed esophageal candidiasis, most patients (91%) had C. albicans isolated at the baseline.

Treatment groups were similar in demographic and other baseline characteristics. In ERAXIS-treated patients, the age range was 16–69 years, the gender distribution was 42% male and 58% female, and the race distribution was 15% White, 49% Black/African American, 15% Asian, 0.3 % Hispanic, 21% other races.

In this study, of 280 patients tested, 237 (84.6%) tested HIV positive. In both groups the median time to resolution of symptoms was 5 days and the median duration of therapy was 14 days.

Efficacy was assessed by endoscopic outcome at end of therapy (EOT). Patients were considered clinically evaluable if they received at least 10 days of therapy, had an EOT assessment with a clinical outcome other than 'indeterminate', had an endoscopy at EOT, and did not have any protocol violations prior to the EOT visit that would affect an assessment of efficacy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Echinocandins for candidiasis in children with HIV are supported by data that are now sufficient to recommend these agents as alternatives to fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis and as first-line therapy for invasive candidiasis (strong, high), while they are not recommended for central nervous system Candida infections due to poor cerebrospinal fluid penetration. For caspofungin in immunocompromised children with HIV infection aged 2 to 17 years, 50 mg/m2 body surface area/day (70 mg/day maximum) provides exposure comparable to adults, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m2 if 50 mg/m2 is tolerated without adequate clinical response, and dosing in neonates is 25 mg/m2/day. For micafungin, the recommended dose for children aged 2 years to 17 years is 2 to 4 mg/kg daily (strong, moderate), neonates require 10 mg/kg daily, and dosages of 10 mg/kg/day are recommended in premature neonates with area-under-the-curve values consistent with an adult dose of 100 to 150 mg/day; micafungin shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with an inverse relationship between age and clearance, and clearance in neonates was more than double that in older children and adults. One PK study of anidulafungin in 25 neutropenic children without HIV infection aged 2 years to 17 years (including 12 children aged 2 years to 11 years and 13 children aged 12 years to 17 years) is reported.

Results

A total of 350 patients were recruited from 30 ICUs across 12 countries. Of these, 11 were excluded due to meeting exclusion criteria, withdrawal of consent, incomplete information, or missing samples. Among the remaining 339 patients, 349 antifungal courses were administered (Supplementary Table 3), with 9 patients receiving a second antifungal and one patient receiving a third. Patient characteristics at admission and on occasion 1 are detailed in Table 1, with electronic supplementary table 4 providing stratification by antifungal. Antifungal therapy was primarily prescribed for treatment (274/339, 80.8%). Fluconazole was the most frequently prescribed antifungal, accounting for 142/349 (40.7%) courses. The most common indication for treatment was intra-abdominal infection (84/274, 30.7%). Fungemia was present in 43/274 (15.7%) patients.

Special considerations during pregnancy—fluconazole risks and first‑trimester management include the following: Topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis in pregnancy, but is essential for vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially during the first trimester. Fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, and higher exposures (>150 mg dosing) in the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects; five cases of fluconazole embryopathy have been reported with chronic dosing at 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. A report from a national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.23-1.77) for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and an increased HR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22-1.77) with low-dose (150–300 mg cumulative dose) exposure; no increase in stillbirth was seen broadly, but increased risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10; CI 95%, 1.89–8.90) occurred with doses >300 mg. Based on these data, substitution of amphotericin B for fluconazole in the first trimester is recommended for invasive or refractory esophageal candidal infections (AIII), and neonates born to women receiving chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia.

### Anidulafungin: a new echinocandin with a novel profile [^3c7ae9cb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, available treatment for serious fungal infections comprised amphotericin B and azoles, which have limitations. Renal toxicity is a major concern with amphotericin B, while drug-drug interactions, hepatotoxicity, and skin rashes are the primary concerns with the azole medications. The development of the echinocandins, including caspofungin, has helped to fill the need for more efficacious antifungals that are useful across different patient populations and have a good safety profile. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin being developed to treat mucosal and invasive fungal infections.

Objective

The aim of this report was to describe the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of anidulafungin.

Methods

Data were identified using MEDLINE and National Library of Medicine Gateway searches for English-language literature (key words: anidulafungin, esophageal candidiasis, echinocandin, caspofungin, ravuconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and fluconazole; years: 1996-2004), and from meeting abstracts of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (Arlington Heights, Illinois), European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (Basel, Switzerland), International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (Washington, DC), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (Arlington, Virginia).

Results

Anidulafungin has potent in vitro activity against Aspergillus and Candida spp, including those resistant to either fluconazole or amphotericin B. Results of several clinical trials imply that anidulafungin is effective in treating esophageal candidiasis (EC), candidemia, and invasive candidiasis (IC). In a Phase III, randomized, blinded clinical trial evaluating anidulafungin (50 mg/d) versus fluconazole (100 mg/d) for the treatment of EC, 97.2% and 98.9% of patients who received anidulafungin and fluconazole, respectively, showed evidence of cure or improvement (treatment difference, -1.6%; 95% CI, -4.1 to 0.8). In a Phase II study of candidasis and candidemia, anidulafungin showed success rates of 72%, 85%, and 83% in patients receiving the drug at dosages of 50, 75, or 100 mg/d, respectively. Studies evaluating the concomitant use of anidulafungin and either amphotericin, voriconazole, or cyclosporine did not show clinically significant drug-drug interactions or altered adverse-event (AE) profiles (P < 0.05). A population PK analysis showed no significant effect of age, race, concomitant medications, or renal or hepatic insufficiency on the PK properties of anidulafungin (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Anidulafungin may offer a new option to treat serious fungal infections, such as EC, azole-refractory EC, candidemia, and IC. In addition, anidulafungin has been associated with no clinically significant drug-drug interactions and few treatment-related AEs. Anidulafungin may offer a new option in the management of serious and difficult-to-treat invasive fungal infections.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) epidemiology in HIV indicates that oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vast majority are caused by Candida albicans, and occurrence is an indicator of immune suppression most often observed with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts <200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease. Fluconazole (or azole) resistance is predominantly the consequence of previous exposure to fluconazole (or other azoles), particularly repeated and long-term exposure, and prior exposure to azole therapy has been associated with a gradual emergence of non-C. albicans species, particularly Candida glabrata, as a cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in patients with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis—whether a single episode or recurrent—is common in healthy, adult women and does not suggest HIV infection.

### ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: diagnostic procedures [^858c0c66]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

As the mortality associated with invasive Candida infections remains high, it is important to make optimal use of available diagnostic tools to initiate antifungal therapy as early as possible and to select the most appropriate antifungal drug. A panel of experts of the European Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the clinical utility and accuracy of different diagnostic tests and procedures for detection of Candida infections. Recommendations about the microbiological investigation and detection of candidaemia, invasive candidiasis, chronic disseminated candidiasis, and oropharyngeal, oesophageal, and vaginal candidiasis were included. In addition, remarks about antifungal susceptibility testing and therapeutic drug monitoring were made.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and British society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (BSPGHAN) joint consensus guidelines on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic oesophagitis in children and adults [^08500488]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to patients with Candida infection, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to administer topical antifungals while continuing topical corticosteroids in patients with Candida infection secondary to topical corticosteroid treatment.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.

### Safety, efficacy, and exposure-response of voriconazole in pediatric patients with invasive aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis or esophageal candidiasis [^d2cee13e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Data on safety and efficacy of voriconazole for invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive candidiasis/esophageal candidiasis (IC/EC) in pediatric patients are limited.

Methods

Patients aged 2-<18 years with IA and IC/EC were enrolled in 2 prospective open-label, non-comparative studies of voriconazole. Patients followed dosing regimens based on age, weight and indication, with adjustments permitted. Treatment duration was 6-12 weeks for IA patients, ≥14 days after last positive Candida culture for IC patients and ≥7 days after signs/symptoms resolution for EC patients. Primary analysis for both the studies was safety and tolerability of voriconazole. Secondary end points included global response success at week 6 and end of treatment (EOT), all-causality mortality and time to death. Voriconazole exposure-response relationship was explored.

Results

Of 53 voriconazole-treated pediatric patients (31 IA; 22 IC/EC), 14 had proven/probable IA, 7 had confirmed IC and 10 had confirmed EC. Treatment-related hepatic and visual adverse events, respectively, were reported in 22.6% and 16.1% of IA patients, and 22.7% and 27.3% of IC/EC patients. All-causality mortality in IA patients was 14.3% at week 6; no deaths were attributed to voriconazole. No deaths were reported for IC/EC patients. Global response success rate was 64.3% (week 6 and EOT) in IA patients and 76.5% (EOT) in IC/EC patients. There was no association between voriconazole exposure and efficacy; however, a slight positive association between voriconazole exposure and hepatic adverse events was established.

Conclusions

Safety and efficacy outcomes in pediatric patients with IA and IC/EC were consistent with previous findings in adult patients.
