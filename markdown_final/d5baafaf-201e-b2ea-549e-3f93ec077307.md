## Question

Is malaria prophylaxis recommended for traveling to a tropical place?

Assistant: Malaria prophylaxis can be important if you're visiting areas where malaria is common. The exact recommendation typically depends on local patterns of resistance and the types of medications available. It's best to talk to a healthcare professional who knows your specific travel plans and medical history before starting any prophylactic treatment. If that's not an option right away, you can consider looking into well-known prophylaxis options like atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine, but the choice often depends on the region and your personal health.

Hey it's nearly midnight… I'm leaving in a couple of days for volunteer work in some forest region near the equator, I don't even know the exact country, no one is around to give advice, so is mefloquine okay or do I skip prophylaxis altogether? I'm worried about side effects.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether malaria prophylaxis is recommended for travel to a tropical location, and if mefloquine is appropriate given last-minute departure and concerns about side effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the destination is actually malaria-endemic and how to verify that quickly. Then, I should weigh the baseline risk of malaria and the consequences of non-prophylaxis. Next, I will review the comparative efficacy and neuropsychiatric safety of mefloquine versus alternatives like atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline. After that, I need to check dosing schedules and whether a last-minute start is feasible. Finally, I will consider special situations, adherence strategies, and what to do if prophylaxis is declined or unavailable, including standby treatment and post-travel vigilance.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: yes, malaria prophylaxis is recommended for travel to tropical regions where malaria transmission occurs, and the decision should be individualized to itinerary, season, accommodation, and traveler health status; importantly, no chemoprophylaxis is 100% effective, so mosquito avoidance remains essential [^115iCEEm].

> Wait, let me verify the destination risk before recommending any drug. "Near the equator" and "forest region" strongly suggest high transmission intensity in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Amazon basin, and parts of Southeast Asia; I should confirm the exact country and region using CDC's country-specific malaria maps, but given the urgency, I should assume high risk and proceed with prophylaxis unless proven otherwise [^notfound].

> I need to check the baseline risk and consequences of not using prophylaxis. More than 90% of U.S. residents who acquire malaria report not adhering to CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis, and malaria is the most common life-threatening tropical disease in returning travelers; severe malaria occurs in about 10% of cases in the U.S., with a case fatality near 0.3%, underscoring that skipping prophylaxis is not safe [^1121yL6T] [^113vtozY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mefloquine without reviewing comparative safety. High-certainty evidence shows mefloquine users are more likely to discontinue due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users, with higher risks of abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, and depressed mood; absolute discontinuation risk is about 6% with mefloquine versus 2% with atovaquone-proguanil, and neuropsychiatric effects are more frequent with mefloquine, though serious adverse events are uncommon [^115qYrnv] [^115xHPPj].

> Let me consider alternatives and timing. Atovaquone-proguanil can be started 1–2 days before travel, taken daily with food, and continued for 7 days after leaving; it is generally well tolerated and avoids the neuropsychiatric profile of mefloquine, making it a strong choice for last-minute travelers who can take a daily regimen [^11467CTW]. Doxycycline is another option started 1–2 days before travel and continued for 4 weeks after return, but it is contraindicated in pregnancy and children under 8 years and can cause photosensitivity and gastrointestinal upset, which may matter depending on the traveler [^117WTrxN].

> I should double-check mefloquine's schedule and whether it still works for a last-minute start. Mefloquine requires initiation at least 1 week before exposure to achieve protective levels, with weekly dosing and continuation for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area; starting now would leave a gap in protection, so mefloquine is not ideal for a departure in a couple of days unless the traveler can delay departure by a week or accept imperfect early coverage with strict mosquito precautions [^113n1Aa1] [^114g4KSx].

> But wait, what if no prophylaxis is started in time? I need to ensure a harm-reduction plan. Travelers should use DEET-containing repellent on exposed skin, permethrin-treated clothing, and sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets; if access to reliable medical care is uncertain, carrying a reliable supply of a different-class treatment regimen (e.g., artemether-lumefantrine or atovaquone-proguanil) for presumptive self-treatment is reasonable, but this does not replace prophylaxis and urgent medical evaluation is still required for any fever during or after travel [^112HHzMs] [^114g4KSx].

> I will now examine special situations that could change the choice. If the traveler has a history of depression, anxiety, psychosis, or seizure disorder, mefloquine should generally be avoided; if pregnancy is possible or planned, doxycycline and primaquine/tafenoquine are contraindicated and mefloquine is considered acceptable in all trimesters; if G6PD status is unknown, primaquine or tafenoquine should not be used for prophylaxis until G6PD is normal [^114g4KSx] [^1125U4J7] [^113n1Aa1].

> Let me reconsider the practical, last-minute recommendation. Given departure in a couple of days, atovaquone-proguanil is the most feasible first-line option to start 1–2 days pre-departure, taken daily with food and continued for 7 days after return, combined with rigorous mosquito avoidance; if atovaquone-proguanil is unavailable or contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative with the caveats above, and mefloquine should be reserved for future travel with adequate lead-in time or for those who cannot take daily regimens and have no neuropsychiatric risk factors [^11467CTW] [^117WTrxN] [^115qYrnv].

> Hold on, I should verify adherence and post-travel planning because effectiveness depends on them. Travelers often stop prophylaxis due to forgetfulness or side effects, so I should counsel on managing common adverse effects, what to do if a dose is missed, and the need to continue prophylaxis after leaving; any fever during or up to a year after travel warrants prompt malaria testing and disclosure of travel history, even if prophylaxis was taken [^1161A8bW] [^112hJg42] [^1121yL6T].

> In summary, I should confirm: do not skip prophylaxis in a high-risk equatorial forest setting; mefloquine is not ideal for a last-minute start; atovaquone-proguanil started 1–2 days before departure plus aggressive mosquito avoidance is the most practical, effective strategy right now; and arrange for post-travel fever surveillance and access to care, with a standby treatment course only if reliable medical access is uncertain [^11467CTW] [^115iCEEm] [^112HHzMs].

Malaria prophylaxis is **recommended for travel to tropical regions with malaria risk** [^115iCEEm], with the choice of drug tailored to the destination's resistance patterns, travel duration, and the traveler's health profile [^114g4KSx]. Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine are **first-line options** [^113t9N6g]; atovaquone-proguanil is preferred for short trips due to its favorable tolerability and short post-trail schedule, while mefloquine is suitable for longer stays with weekly dosing [^11467CTW] [^115qYrnv]. Prophylaxis should be started before travel, continued during the stay, and extended after return as required [^114g4KSx]; no regimen is 100% effective, so **mosquito avoidance remains essential** [^115iCEEm]. Consult a travel clinic or healthcare provider 4–6 weeks before departure for individualized advice [^117Mn4By].

---

## Geographic risk assessment

Malaria risk varies by region, season, and travel itinerary; **sub-Saharan Africa has the highest risk**, whereas parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia have moderate or low risk [^112X3cB3]. Risk is higher in rural areas, during the rainy season, and with prolonged stays [^115iCEEm]. Even short visits to high-transmission areas can result in infection, so **individualized risk assessment is essential** [^113Ajypj].

---

## Recommended malaria prophylaxis regimens

Several **antimalarial regimens are recommended** for travelers, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Medication** | **Dosage regimen** | **Indications and considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) | Daily, start 1–2 days before travel, continue during stay, and for 7 days after return | - Well tolerated <br/> - Suitable for short trips <br/> - Not recommended for pregnant women or those with severe renal impairment [^11467CTW] |
| Doxycycline | Daily, start 1–2 days before travel, continue during stay, and for 4 weeks after return | - Effective against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy and children under 8 years <br/> - Photosensitivity and gastrointestinal side effects common [^117WTrxN] |
| Mefloquine | Weekly, start 1–2 weeks before travel, continue during stay, and for 4 weeks after return | - Suitable for long-term travelers <br/> - Contraindicated in individuals with psychiatric disorders or seizure disorders <br/> - Neuropsychiatric side effects possible [^115qYrnv] |
| Primaquine | Daily, start 1–2 days before travel, continue during stay, and for 7 days after return | - Effective against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale <br/> - Requires G6PD testing due to risk of hemolytic anemia <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy [^113kDUYH] |

---

## Timing and duration of prophylaxis

Prophylaxis should begin **before exposure** to ensure adequate drug levels in the bloodstream [^114g4KSx]. The duration after return varies by medication: atovaquone-proguanil for 7 days, doxycycline for 4 weeks, and mefloquine for 4 weeks [^11467CTW] [^117WTrxN]. Adherence to the full course is critical for effectiveness [^1121yL6T].

---

## Effectiveness and limitations

Chemoprophylaxis significantly reduces malaria risk but is **not 100% effective** [^114Y54qJ]. Breakthrough infections can occur, particularly with poor adherence or in areas of high transmission intensity [^1121yL6T]. Therefore, **mosquito avoidance measures** — such as insect repellent, bed nets, and protective clothing — remain essential [^115iCEEm].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Mefloquine is considered safe in all trimesters; atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline are generally avoided [^1125U4J7].
- **Children**: Pediatric dosing is weight-based; atovaquone-proguanil is suitable for children weighing ≥ 5 kg [^115cLiBp].
- **Long-term travelers**: Mefloquine is often preferred due to weekly dosing; adherence may wane over time, necessitating ongoing counseling [^111dkVkd].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Malaria prophylaxis is **strongly recommended** for travelers to tropical regions with malaria risk [^115iCEEm]. The choice of medication should be individualized based on destination, duration of stay, and personal health considerations. Consultation with a healthcare provider or travel clinic 4–6 weeks before departure is advised to ensure appropriate prophylaxis and counseling [^116yvYST].

### Prevention of malaria in travelers [^1118w9TW]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Malaria is a major international public health problem, responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality around the world each year. As travel to tropical locations increases, U.S. physicians are being asked more frequently to provide recommendations for malaria prevention. An organized approach to reducing the risk of acquiring this disease is necessary. Physicians must review the itineraries of their patients in detail, paying particularly close attention to travel within malaria-endemic areas and drug-resistant zones. Appropriate chemoprophylaxis must be chosen to reduce the risk of acquiring malaria. It also is important to provide advice on the use of protective measures that reduce the risk of mosquito bites. Finally, travelers should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms of the disease develop during or after the trip.

### Prevention of malaria in travelers [^112X3cB3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

There are approximately 300 million cases of malaria each year, resulting in 1 million deaths worldwide. Family physicians often encounter patients preparing to travel to malaria-endemic regions. Physicians should have basic knowledge of parasite transmission and malaria prevention. The risk of malaria acquisition is based largely on geographic location and travel season. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia between the months of May and December. Key elements in prevention include barrier protection and chemoprophylaxis. Travelers to malaria-endemic areas should be advised to use mosquito repellent at all times and bed netting at night. Prophylactic medication should be initiated before travel and continued after return. Travelers should be warned that malaria symptoms can present up to one year after a mosquito bite. Symptoms are vague, and may include fever, chills, arthralgias, and headaches. Travelers experiencing symptoms should seek prompt medical attention.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — fever during travel and after return — travelers in a malaria-endemic area who develop fever should promptly seek medical help and continue malaria chemoprophylaxis, and after returning, fever despite prophylaxis warrants immediate medical care with travel history reporting, malaria testing, and prompt treatment if infection is confirmed; note that malaria chemoprophylaxis, while highly effective, is not 100% effective.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112UyiDd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria — traveler risk and prophylaxis considerations include that many foreign-born individuals develop malaria in the United States because of distant exposure before arrival or from more recent travel, and U.S.-born individuals can develop malaria during travel to endemic areas; failure to take appropriate chemoprophylaxis is a common problem for both groups and people who formerly lived in malarious areas may believe they are immune and do not need prophylaxis. Such patients are at high risk of infection because they likely have lost partial immunity within 6 months after leaving endemic regions. In returning travelers who are febrile, of the nearly 50 million individuals who travel to developing countries each year, between 5% and 11% develop a fever during or after travel, and malaria is a surprisingly common cause of these fevers.

### Malaria prevention in travelers [^115JzSmq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

A common approach to malaria prevention is to follow the "A, B, C, D" rule: Awareness of risk, Bite avoidance, Compliance with chemoprophylaxis, and prompt Diagnosis in case of fever. The risk of acquiring malaria depends on the length and intensity of exposure; the risk of developing severe disease is primarily determined by the health status of the traveler. These parameters need to be assessed before recommending chemoprophylaxis and/or stand-by emergency treatment. This review discusses the different strategies and drug options available for the prevention of malaria during and post travel.

### The pretravel consultation [^116c9hyw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Key components of the pretravel consultation include intake questions regarding the traveler's anticipated itinerary and medical history; immunizations; malaria prophylaxis; and personal protection measures against arthropod bites, traveler's diarrhea, and injury. Most vaccinations that are appropriate for international travelers are included in the routine domestic immunization schedule; only a few travel-specific vaccines must also be discussed. The most common vaccine-preventable illnesses in international travelers are influenza and hepatitis A. Malaria prophylaxis should be offered to travelers to endemic regions. Personal protection measures, such as applying an effective insect repellent to exposed skin and permethrin to clothing and using a permethrin-impregnated bed net, should be advised for travelers to the tropics. Clinicians should offer an antibiotic prescription that travelers can take with them in case of traveler's diarrhea. Additional topics to address during the pretravel consultation include the risk of injury from motor vehicle crashes and travel-specific risks such as altitude sickness, safe sex practices, and emergency medical evacuation insurance.

HIV travelers — malaria and other vector-borne pathogens — pre-travel assessment and prevention: Pre-travel consultation for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should include an assessment of travel destinations and risk of exposure to malaria and other vector-borne pathogens. The risk of malaria and disease severity are increased in people with HIV, especially for people with advanced HIV. People with HIV who have a low CD4 count and HIV-infected women who are pregnant (or likely to become pregnant), regardless of CD4 count, should consider delaying travel to malaria-endemic areas. If travel cannot be deferred, use of effective malaria prophylaxis and precautions to avoid mosquito bites are essential. Preventive measures include chemoprophylaxis and mosquito-avoidance measures, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, the use of DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)-containing repellants, and wearing clothes that cover most of the body. Mosquito-avoidance measures can also prevent exposure to arboviral diseases including chikungunya, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Zika, and used in combination, these preventive measures are highly effective. Healthcare professionals should be aware of potential drug interactions between malaria chemoprophylaxis and common antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, and any febrile traveler returning from a malaria-endemic area should be tested for malaria, even if they took chemoprophylaxis.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis patient counseling — adverse event self‑management and missed doses provides practical instructions. The text advises, "It is helpful to provide travelers with approaches to managing any adverse events they may experience from malaria chemoprophylaxis medication (e.g., remember to take with food; change time of day; identify other causes of symptoms; manage symptoms without stopping antimalarial if possible)" and to "know what to do if they miss a dose (take the next dose with food as soon as possible; do not double the dose the day after the missed dose)".

### Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone) [^114MywSh]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be instructed:

to take MALARONE at the same time each day with food or a milky drink.
to take a repeat dose of MALARONE if vomiting occurs within 1 hour after dosing.
to take a dose as soon as possible if a dose is missed, then return to their normal dosing schedule. However, if a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.
that rare serious adverse events such as hepatitis, severe skin reactions, neurological events, and hematological events have been reported when MALARONE was used for the prophylaxis or treatment of malaria.
to consult a healthcare professional regarding alternative forms of prophylaxis if prophylaxis with MALARONE is prematurely discontinued for any reason.
that protective clothing, insect repellents, and bed nets are important components of malaria prophylaxis.
that no chemoprophylactic regimen is 100% effective; therefore, patients should seek medical attention for any febrile illness that occurs during or after return from a malaria‑endemic area and inform their healthcare professional that they may have been exposed to malaria.
that falciparum malaria carries a higher risk of death and serious complications in pregnant women than in the general population. Pregnant women anticipating travel to malarious areas should discuss the risks and benefits of such travel with their physicians.

### WHO guidelines for malaria [^114NNRZx]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to elimination programs, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering antimalarial therapy as chemoprevention in all persons residing with or near a confirmed malaria case and all persons sharing the same risk of infection (such as co-travelers and co-workers) to prevent or reduce malaria transmission in areas approaching elimination or post-elimination settings preventing re-establishment of transmission.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114jptdZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria — clinical suspicion after travel — chemoprophylaxis is not completely effective, and malaria should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever or other signs or symptoms consistent with malaria in anyone who traveled to malaria-endemic areas during the previous 12 months. Because malaria medications purchased in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia may be counterfeit, the index of suspicion must remain high when evaluating children with fever coming from endemic areas, regardless of prior history of antimalarial therapy.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^1121yL6T]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Post-travel evaluation — malaria risk and testing in febrile travelers returning from malaria-endemic areas emphasizes that patients should therefore be asked about prescription of and adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis, that strict adherence substantially reduces the risk of malaria and increases the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis, and that regardless of chemoprophylaxis history, in travelers with febrile illness returning from malaria-endemic areas, the diagnosis should always be ruled out by appropriate diagnostic testing; more than 90% of US residents who acquire travel-associated malaria report not having adhered to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen.

### Drug-free holidays: pre-travel versus during travel malaria chemoprophylaxis [^115QPCEu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Although efficacious forms of malaria chemoprophylaxis currently exist, many travelers to malaria-endemic areas fail to use them effectively. We suggest that taking antimalarial medications prior to travel may prevent more malaria by improving compliance. Treatment regimens of antimalarial drugs taken prior to travel could protect persons for up to one month of exposure. We urge additional testing of pre-travel malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens.

### Preparing for international travel and global medical care [^111FnbPx]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Thorough pretravel preparation and medical consultation can mitigate avoidable health and safety risks. A comprehensive pretravel medical consultation should include an individualized risk assessment, immunization review, and discussion of arthropod protective measures, malaria prophylaxis, traveler's diarrhea, and injury prevention. Travel with children and jet lag reduction require additional planning and prevention strategies; travel and evacuation insurance may prove essential when traveling to less resourced countries. Consideration should also be given to other high-risk travel scenarios, including the provision of health care overseas, adventure and extreme sports, water environments and diving, high altitude, and terrorism/unstable political situations.

### The pretravel consultation: recent updates [^112N8dVn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimates suggest that 43%-79% of international travelers may develop travel-related illnesses. Most such illnesses are considered mild and self-limited; however, some are life-threatening. The pretravel consultation is aimed at assessing risks for a range of illnesses, communicating these risks, and then providing individualized recommendations and interventions to minimize or manage such risks. The effective consultation is predicated on a well-prepared clinician and motivated traveler, understanding the traveler's perception of, and tolerance for, risk, and providing education applicable to the actual itinerary. Integral to the clinician's preparation is regular review of up-to-date trip-specific recommendations; country-specific information and recommendations are readily available and can now be efficiently accessed. From the infectious diseases perspective, immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, insect repellent use, and travelers' diarrhea and its self-management are cornerstones of the consultation. This review focuses primarily on updating these 4 topics with recently published information relevant to adult travelers.

Changing medications as a result of side effects during chemoprophylaxis — medications recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis have different modes of action that affect the parasites at different stages of the life cycle, so if the medication needs to be changed because of side effects before a full course has been completed, some special considerations exist. Switching from a daily to a weekly chemoprophylaxis medication is not recommended because it takes time for the weekly medication to reach protective levels.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^112HHzMs]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Reliable supply of malaria treatment — selected travelers may carry a full treatment course, which does not replace chemoprophylaxis, and self-treatment is only a temporary measure. Some travelers who take effective chemoprophylaxis but will be in remote areas might, in consultation with their travel health professional, carry a reliable supply of a full course of an approved malaria treatment regimen; this reliable supply does not obviate the need for malaria chemoprophylaxis and provides immediate access to an approved treatment if malaria is diagnosed. The reliable supply should be acquired in the United States, and in rare instances without medical access it can be self-administered presumptively, but self-treatment of a possible malarial infection is only a temporary measure and prompt medical evaluation is imperative. Two malaria treatment regimens available in the United States can be prescribed as a reliable supply for self-treatment — atovaquone-proguanil and artemether-lumefantrine — and the chosen medication should not be the same (or related) drug taken for chemoprophylaxis; for example, atovaquone-proguanil can be used as a reliable supply medication by travelers who are not taking atovaquone-proguanil for chemoprophylaxis.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 6 family travel [^114MZb1c]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Malaria risk in pediatric travelers — epidemiology, severity, and diagnostic vigilance — is highlighted as follows: Malaria is among the most serious and life-threatening infections acquired by pediatric international travelers; Pediatric travelers are at particularly high risk for malaria infection if they do not receive prophylaxis; Among people reported with malaria in the United States in 2018, 88% had traveled to Africa, 16% were children < 18 years old, with 22% of these under the age of 5 years; most were visiting friends or relatives (VFR travelers), and most did not take malaria chemoprophylaxis; Children with malaria can rapidly develop high levels of parasitemia and are at risk for severe complications of malaria, including seizures, coma, or death; Delays in diagnosis resulting in severe malaria are common, particularly when the diagnosis is not considered from the outset; Healthcare professionals should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in all travelers returning from malaria-risk areas with fever and/or flu-like symptoms and should be aware of alterations of the typical presentation of illness that can occur in the setting of incomplete or inadequate courses of prophylaxis or treatment.

### New guidelines on malaria prevention: a summary [^114ntbqJ]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Travellers to many tropical areas remain at risk of contracting malaria. Resistance of malaria parasites to a number of drugs continues to increase in degree and distribution, so that some older, trusted prophylactic drugs, such as chloroquine, are no longer useful in some parts of the world. Despite the introduction of new drugs and the reduction of malaria risk in some areas, such as parts of India, the number of people travelling continues to increase and malaria reports in the UK are not decreasing. New updated prevention guidelines from the Health Protection Agency Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACMP) in UK travellers (Chiodini P, Hill D, Lalloo D, Lea G, Walker E, Whitty C, et al. Guidelines for malaria prevention in travellers from the United Kingdom. London: Health Protection Agency; January 2007. Available from: http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/default.htm) aim to raise awareness of the risks of malaria and help UK travel health advisors in giving malaria prevention advice to all those who need it. Together with the ACMP malaria treatment guidelines it is hoped that the risk of illness and death from malaria in UK travellers can be reduced. This article summarises the new ACMP malaria prevention guidelines.

### New strategies for the prevention of malaria in travelers [^116eQLVa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Malaria prevention has benefited from many diverse disciplines of research, including epidemiologic monitoring, development of laboratory techniques, assessment of insect repellents, or pharmaceutical innovations. Strategies in all these sectors have been explored in recent years, resulting in improved options to prevent travelers' malaria. The addition of atovaquone-proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis and the recommendation of primaquine as primary prophylaxis have been significant advances. Tafenoquine seems promising. Standby treatment recommendations have been refined. Many areas still need better strategies. Problematic areas include chemoprophylaxis for long-term travelers, expatriates, and pregnant women; optimal criteria for terminal prophylaxis; and the prevention of malaria in populations that are least likely to seek pretravel evaluations, such as those visiting friends and relatives in their home countries (VFRs). Finally, research in travel and tropical medicine should continue to focus on additional strategies to confront the ever-widening challenge of drug-resistant malaria.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — obtaining medications overseas cautions against sourcing abroad due to uncertain quality and recommendations. The guidance states, "Travelers should be discouraged from obtaining chemoprophylaxis medications while abroad". It further notes, "Malaria chemoprophylaxis medications might be available at overseas destinations, including drugs not recommended in the United States; however, the quality of these products is often not known".

Malaria chemoprophylaxis missed doses — compared with drugs with short half-lives, which are taken daily, drugs with longer half-lives, which are taken weekly, offer the advantage of a wider margin of error if the traveler is late with a dose; for a weekly drug, prophylactic blood levels can remain adequate if the dose is only 1–2 days late and the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible, then resume weekly doses on the originally scheduled day; if the traveler is > 2 days late, blood levels might not be adequate, so the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible and resume weekly dosing on the new day of the week, with the next dose 1 week later, then weekly thereafter; for a daily drug, if the traveler is 1–2 days late, protective blood levels are less likely to be maintained, and the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible and resume the daily schedule at the new time of day.

Malaria in visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travelers — VFRs who visited a malaria endemic area more frequently (> 5 times) were more likely to develop clinical malaria on return, and they were less successful than non-VFR travelers in implementing preventive strategies such as chemoprophylaxis and insect avoidance due to multiple barriers. The risk of delay in clinical diagnosis and treatment after return emphasizes the importance of appropriate pre-travel care and prevention strategies, including chemoprophylaxis, and it is also important to discuss with travelers the need to obtain timely medical care if fever develops during or after travel to a malaria endemic area and to stress that they should notify US healthcare professionals of their recent travel history.

Immunocompromised travelers — contraindications and other health risks — Healthcare professionals should assess whether the traveler's conditions, medications, or treatments constitute contraindications to, decrease the effectiveness of, or increase the risk for adverse events from disease-prevention measures for the trip. Depending on destination, measures might include immunizations or medications for malaria chemoprophylaxis or self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea. Clinicians also should assess whether destination health hazards could exacerbate underlying conditions or cause more severe outcomes in an immunocompromised traveler and determine whether specific interventions are available to mitigate these risks.

Regarding specific circumstances for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (counseling), RCOG 2010 guidelines recommend to advise pregnant females regarding the following:

- the risks of travel to malaria-endemic countries and consider postponing their trip unless travel is unavoidable

- seeking guidance from a center with expertise on malaria risks and avoidance strategies

- the risk of being exposed to malaria at her intended travel area

- fever or flu-like illness while traveling or upon returning home, up to ≥ 1 year, may indicate malaria and requires medical attention

- bite prevention measures including skin repellents, knock-down mosquito sprays, insecticide-treated bed nets, clothing, and room protection

- the risks and benefits of chemoprophylaxis versus the risks of malaria

- there is no 100% protective malaria prophylaxis regimen.

Malaria prevention and chemoprophylaxis for long-term travelers (Travel > 6 Months) outlines that malaria prevention measures are the same for both short- and long-term travelers, but longer stays mean longer duration of exposure and increased risk of acquiring malaria, travelers' attention to mosquito avoidance can wane over time, travelers might not adhere to a lengthy course of malaria chemoprophylaxis due to forgetfulness, fear of side effects, and a possible declining sense of risk and need over time, travelers might move between highly endemic or low endemic areas within a country or region, travelers might have a decreased sense of risk and concern about malaria after engaging in local conversations and lore, and travelers who become ill with malaria in countries with limited access and quality of health care might not receive appropriate or effective treatment. Additional advice specifies that travelers should not count on being able to obtain safe, reliable malaria chemoprophylaxis medication abroad; strongly advise that before leaving the United States they purchase enough medication to last them for the entire duration of their travel to malaria-endemic areas, emphasize continued adherence to and safety of malaria chemoprophylaxis drugs, develop a plan for seeking immediate care when ill with fever including where to get tested and treated for malaria promptly, advise travelers to purchase travel insurance including contingencies for medical evacuation, and consider prescribing a reliable supply of a treatment dose of antimalarial drugs to be available in case malaria is diagnosed while traveling.

### The pretravel consultation [^116yvYST]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients who will be traveling internationally should be advised to schedule dedicated pretravel assessments with their primary care physicians. The pretravel consultation is a vital opportunity for physicians to review preventive and risk-reduction strategies with travelers. Critical components of the patient interview include travel itinerary, anticipated high-risk activity, and medical history. This information affects subsequent recommendations for immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, personal protective measures, and risk-reduction measures. Physicians should review whether routine and seasonal immunizations, including those for COVID-19 and influenza, are up to date and determine whether location-specific immunizations are warranted. Malaria prophylaxis and counseling on personal protective measures, including minimizing skin exposure and using insect repellant, permethrin-treated clothing, bed nets, and screens, are recommended for travelers visiting endemic areas. A single dose of antibiotics may be considered for self-treatment of traveler's diarrhea without features of dysentery. Travelers with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, should carry documentation of medical issues and enough medications and supplies to last for the duration of travel. Activity-specific concerns include sunburn, motor vehicle crashes, water safety, altitude sickness, and risks associated with sexual behaviors.

### Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas [^115qYrnv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%). In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers). One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence). Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence). Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia. Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush. Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings.

Authors' Conclusions

The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil). The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.

Malaria in returned travelers — Malaria is the most common life-threatening tropical disease associated with fever in returned travelers, and in the United States approximately 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year; more than 90% of reported cases of P. falciparum malaria manifest ≤ 30 days of return, whereas almost half of cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria manifest > 30 days after return. A history of taking malaria chemoprophylaxis does not exclude the possibility of malaria, and patients with malaria can be afebrile at the time of evaluation but typically give a history of fever or chills; malaria (especially P. falciparum) can progress rapidly and therefore requires prompt evaluation and initiation of treatment. In the United States, severe malaria occurs in approximately 10% of patients with malaria, and around 0.3% of those receiving a diagnosis of malaria die.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — choosing a drug for travelers to malaria areas — states that all recommended regimens involve taking a medicine before, during, and after travel, and beginning the drug before travel allows the antimalarial agent to be in the blood before exposure to malaria parasites. Selection should consider the presence of antimalarial drug resistance in the area of travel, length of travel, the patient's other medical conditions, allergy history, other medications prescribed or already being taken, potential side effects, and the cost of the antimalarial. Because both tafenoquine and primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia in persons with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, quantitative G6PD testing must be done before prescribing primaquine or tafenoquine. No antimalarial drug is 100% protective, so travelers must combine chemoprophylaxis with mosquito avoidance and personal protective measures (e.g., insect repellent, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, sleeping in a mosquito-free setting, using an insecticide-treated mosquito net).

### Choosing a drug to prevent malaria… [^113t9N6g]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Drugs to prevent malaria differ by country of travel.
- Counsel patients to use personal protective measures along with malaria chemoprophylaxis.
- Consider contraindications and drug-drug interactions when prescribing a malaria prophylaxis.
- Consider the timing of when to start and stop chemoprophylaxis. Some medications require patients take them weeks in advance of travel and continued after leaving the malaria-endemic area. Considerations Considerations when choosing a drug for malaria prophylaxis:

- Recommendations for drugs to prevent malaria differ by country of travel and can be found in CDC's Yellow Book chapter on Malaria Prevention Information, by Country. Recommended drugs for each country are listed in alphabetical order and have comparable efficacy in that country.
- When used correctly malaria chemoprophylaxis is very effective. Using multiple prevention strategies together offer additional protection.

Counsel patients on the use of personal protective measures, along with malaria chemoprophylaxis.
- Some people prefer to take a daily medicine
- Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 1–2 days before traveling to an area where malaria transmission occurs
- Tends to be the least expensive antimalarial
- Some people are already taking doxycycline chronically for prevention of acne. In those instances, they do not have to take an additional medicine. Adults: 30 mg base, daily Children:

0. 5 mg/kg base up to adult dose daily
- It is one of the most effective medicines for preventing P. vivaxand so it is a good choice for travel to places with > 90% P. vivax. Begin daily for 3 days prior to travel, weekly during travel, and for 1 week after leaving. Adults only: 200 mg per dose.
- One of the most effective drugs for prevention of P. vivax malaria, but also prevents P. falciparum
- Good choice for shorter trips because you only have to take the medicine once, 1 week after traveling rather than 4 weeks
- Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 3 days before traveling to an area where malaria transmission occurs.

Abstract

Background

Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria‐endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE; and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP;) and ClinicalTrials.gov for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non‐randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short‐term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self‐reported or clinician‐assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses.

Mefloquine efficacy

Of 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short‐term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).

In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone‐proguanil and doxycycline in non‐immune, short‐term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants).

Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone‐proguanil

Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone‐proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone‐proguanil (940 travellers).

One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short‐term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate‐certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate‐certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate‐certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate‐certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer‐term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high‐certainty evidence) and dizziness (high‐certainty evidence).

Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone‐proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood.

Mefloquine safety versus doxycycline

No difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low‐certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Six cohort studies in longer‐term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short‐term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short‐term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.

Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty‐evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low‐certainty evidence).

Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.

Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non‐military participants, provided no conclusive findings.

Authors' conclusions

The absolute risk of malaria during short‐term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone‐proguanil).

The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once‐weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be instructed:

to take Atovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride tablets at the same time each day with food or a milky drink.
to take a repeat dose of Atovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride tablets if vomiting occurs within 1 hour after dosing.
to take a dose as soon as possible if a dose is missed, then return to their normal dosing schedule. However, if a dose is skipped, the patient should not double the next dose.
that rare serious adverse events such as hepatitis, severe skin reactions, neurological events, and hematological events have been reported when atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride was used for the prophylaxis or treatment of malaria.
to consult a healthcare professional regarding alternative forms of prophylaxis if prophylaxis with Atovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride tablets is prematurely discontinued for any reason.
that protective clothing, insect repellents, and bed nets are important components of malaria prophylaxis.
that no chemoprophylactic regimen is 100% effective; therefore, patients should seek medical attention for any febrile illness that occurs during or after return from a malaria-endemic area and inform their healthcare professional that they may have been exposed to malaria.
that falciparum malaria carries a higher risk of death and serious complications in pregnant women than in the general population. Pregnant women anticipating travel to malarious areas should discuss the risks and benefits of such travel with their physicians.

Prevention of malaria — combine mosquito-avoidance measures with chemoprophylaxis, test all febrile returnees, and tailor measures to individualized risk. Malaria prevention consists of a combination of mosquito-avoidance measures and chemoprophylaxis, and prevention measures must address all malaria species in the travel area. Although highly efficacious, interventions are not 100% effective, so all febrile persons returning from malaria-endemic areas should be tested for malaria even if they took chemoprophylaxis. A risk assessment for every traveler includes itinerary details, traveler characteristics, and epidemiological features at the destination, and depending on risk it might be appropriate to recommend no specific interventions, mosquito avoidance measures only, or mosquito avoidance measures plus chemoprophylaxis. Several factors increase risk, including travel — even for short periods — to areas with intense transmission, heterogeneity of transmission within countries, travel during peak transmission season in seasonal settings, and staying in rural areas or accommodations without screens or air conditioning.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been shown to reduce malaria in HIV-infected adults in Africa; however, it is not as effective as antimalarial prophylactic regimens, and therefore HIV-infected travelers should not rely on TMP-SMX for prophylaxis against malaria (AIII).

### Problem pathogens: prevention of malaria in travellers [^111Ee1L3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Human infection with Plasmodium spp leading to clinical episodes of malaria probably began very early in the history of humankind and has persistently inflicted disease among human populations. Malaria is currently considered the world's most important parasitic infection. The global impact of malaria is incalculable and appears to be worsening over the past decades. Although most of this burden of disease is carried by developing tropical countries, cases of imported malaria acquired by international travel are increasingly reported. These numbers are growing because of increased travel to malaria-endemic areas and also due to increased risk of transmission in these areas. Indeed, travel has contributed to the global spread of malaria during the history of humankind. Travellers visiting malaria risk areas should use both personal protective measures and chemoprophylaxis. Non-adherence to chemoprophylactic regimens is frequently secondary to drug side-effects. Therefore, a careful risk-benefit analysis on the use of antimalarial prophylaxis should be carried out in every individual travelling to malaria risk areas. Standby malaria self-treatment represents an alternative in some travellers. However, carefully selected and geographically specific antimalarial drug regimens should be recommended to non-immune people travelling to high-risk areas.

### Review of malaria risk and prevention for use in corporate travel [^116CL11b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Malaria continues to be a significant, life-threatening illness in many parts of the world. For corporate travelers from countries with low endemicity, the risk of infection is considerable. Many corporate travelers are unaware of their risk, unsure of the correct preventative measures, and receive incorrect advice regarding prevention or do not comply with advice they have received. This review addresses the risk of malaria to the nonimmune corporate traveler, disease transmission, and recommended means of prevention, including prevention of mosquito bites and antimalaria chemoprophylaxis.

### Economics of malaria prevention in US travelers to west Africa [^112D64xU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pretravel health consultations help international travelers manage travel-related illness risks through education, vaccination, and medication. This study evaluated costs and benefits of that portion of the health consultation associated with malaria prevention provided to US travelers bound for West Africa.

Methods

The estimated change in disease risk and associated costs and benefits resulting from traveler adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis were calculated from 2 perspectives: the healthcare payer's and the traveler's. We used data from the Global TravEpiNet network of US travel clinics that collect de-identified pretravel data for international travelers. Disease risk and chemoprophylaxis effectiveness were estimated from published medical reports. Direct medical costs were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and published literature.

Results

We analyzed 1029 records from January 2009 to January 2011. Assuming full adherence to chemoprophylaxis regimens, consultations saved healthcare payers a per-traveler average of $14 (9-day trip) to $372 (30-day trip). For travelers, consultations resulted in a range of net cost of $20 (9-day trip) to a net savings of $32 (30-day trip). Differences were mostly driven by risk of malaria in the destination country.

Conclusions

Our model suggests that healthcare payers save money for short- and longer-term trips, and that travelers save money for longer trips when travelers adhere to malaria recommendations and prophylactic regimens in West Africa. This is a potential incentive to healthcare payers to offer consistent pretravel preventive care to travelers. This financial benefit complements the medical benefit of reducing the risk of malaria.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria — high-risk groups and prophylaxis for travelers: United States-born children visiting family in malaria-endemic regions are at highest risk of malaria infection, and children of foreign citizenship, children of unknown resident status, and adopted children from countries of endemic malaria transmission are also at high risk; families should be prepared with malaria chemoprophylaxis and educated with travel advice before returning to endemic areas (AII). Naturally acquired immunity develops after age 5 years in people who reside in areas of stable malaria transmission, is partial, wanes quickly after leaving endemic areas, and may not be present in HIV-infected populations with advanced immunodeficiency; therefore, both adults and children living in the United States who were born in malaria-endemic areas should be prescribed the same prophylaxis as any other patients traveling to malaria-endemic areas.

Malaria — prevention recommendations and evaluation guidance: Recommendations for preventing exposure and for primary chemoprophylaxis are identical for HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals; all travelers to malaria-endemic regions should receive pre-travel counseling on appropriate preventive measures and the avoidance of mosquitos (AII). Families should be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of malaria and the need for early medical intervention if these signs and symptoms are present, and an early appropriate medical evaluation should be completed on all patients returning from a malaria-endemic area who have unexplained fever or other signs or symptoms of malaria.

CDC Yellow Book 2026 — screening asymptomatic travelers states that "The CDC has no official guidance or recommendations for screening asymptomatic international travelers in the absence of specific risk factors for infectious diseases". The decision to screen "depends on their exposure history, itinerary, type of travel, immune status, and the public health implications of identifying infection". For healthy short-term travelers without a particular exposure, screening "is not routinely necessary", whereas healthcare professionals "may consider performing screening tests for long-term travelers (e.g., adventure travelers, expatriates, humanitarian aid workers, missionaries, travelers visiting friends and relatives) who might have prolonged or heavy exposure to epidemiologically relevant pathogens with potential for long-term consequences". Those who are, or are expected to become, immunosuppressed "could be screened" based on relevant exposures. A comprehensive travel history "is essential in guiding screening decisions", yet the type of travel "is of limited predictive value" for individual risk; therefore recommendations focus on broad traveler categories and "emphasize capturing the infections of greatest clinical significance, with the understanding that other 'exotic' infections will not always be detected". For long-term travelers on hiatus, a periodic travel health consultation "offers the healthcare professionals a chance to screen for infectious diseases, to conduct a general health evaluation, and to review health behaviors, malaria prophylaxis, and vaccination status".

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria — travel-related risk and chemoprophylaxis: Many foreign-born individuals develop malaria in the United States because of distant exposure or travel, and U.S.-born individuals can develop malaria during travel to endemic areas. Failure to take appropriate chemoprophylaxis is a common problem for both groups, and people who formerly lived in malarious areas may believe they are immune; such patients are at high risk because they likely have lost partial immunity within 6 months after leaving endemic regions. Among the nearly 50 million individuals who travel to developing countries each year, between 5% and 11% develop a fever during or after travel, and malaria is a surprisingly common cause of these fevers.

### Plasmodium knowlesi malaria in persons returning to Israel from Thailand, 2023 [^1175P84Q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Both patients reported here met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chemoprophylaxis, having stayed in forested regions near international borders. The patients' extended travel and jungle exposure highlight the importance of itinerary-specific pretravel counseling.

In conclusion, P. knowlesi malaria in patient 1 might represent early evidence of zoonotic spillover of P. knowlesi in a new area (northern Thailand). Traveler-based surveillance and molecular tools can provide early warning of geographic shifts in malaria transmission. Heightened clinical awareness and improved diagnostics are essential for timely detection and control.

Long-term travelers to areas where malaria is endemic are at risk for this potentially fatal disease; however, malaria can be prevented through the use of insecticide-treated bednets, mosquito repellents, and chemoprophylaxis. Three options for chemoprophylaxis are available in the Africa region: mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil. These options differ by dosing regimen, cost, and side effect profile. Long-term adverse effects of these drugs have been reported rarely.

### A deadly wait for U.S. health insurance coverage-sitting on the couch with malaria [^115haXCz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Uninsured and unprepared travelers to countries with endemic tropical diseases pose great health-care burdens and financial risks on returning to the United States. We discuss the delayed presentation of an uninsured U.S. traveler returning from West Africa with severe malaria who required intensive care measures to save his life. Despite being critically ill on his return, he sat rigoring on his couch taking antipyretics for 3 days, while he applied for insurance on the Affordable Care Act website and waited for approval because he was fearful of the costs of seeking care. He also had limited access to affordable pretravel consultation and prophylactic medications and did not take them because he had no insurance. Average fees for a malaria hospitalization cost $25,789; however, this patient accumulated fees nearing $300,000-and his care was reimbursed by emergency Medicaid with $39,000, because his newly accepted insurance did not cover his hospitalization. This patients' experience in the U.S. health-care system with a deadly tropical disease exemplifies the need for affordable universal coverage of pretravel consultation and malaria prophylaxis. In this uncertain political time and the recent removal of the health insurance mandate, along with the White House and Congress wanting to reform health care, this case supports the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) statements showing the need for funding of tropical medicine education, research, and public health services for travelers, not cuts to important agencies and insurances that keep our country safe from imported deadly tropical diseases.

### Outbreak of locally acquired mosquito-transmitted (autochthonous) malaria-Florida and Texas, may-July 2023 [^112X8ejs]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Malaria was eliminated as a public health threat in the United States in the mid-1950s, and the World Health Organization certified the United States malaria-free in 1970. Currently, approximately 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States annually, although most cases are imported from countries where malaria remains endemic.

As of August 4, no additional autochthonous P. vivax cases have been detected in Florida or Texas since early July, and there has been no evidence of infected Anopheles mosquitoes since early June. * The autochthonous malaria cases during this investigation highlight the importance of controlling cases globally to prevent future autochthonous cases in the United States. Species of Anopheles mosquitoes that are biologically capable of transmitting malaria are found throughout many regions of the United States. †††

Although the risk for autochthonous malaria in the United States remains very low, §§§ U.S. clinicians need to consider a malaria diagnosis in patients with an unexplained fever, especially in areas where autochthonous malaria has been recently reported. The occurrence of the current autochthonous cases underscores the potential for imported malaria cases in areas with competent vectors to produce local mosquito transmission of malaria parasites. Targeted mosquito surveillance based on the location of human cases is important in predicting human risk and preventing disease in humans. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of persons with malaria can prevent severe disease or death and limit ongoing transmission to local Anopheles mosquitoes and other persons. Continued reporting of malaria cases to jurisdictional health departments and CDC will help ensure robust surveillance to prevent, detect, and respond to autochthonous malaria in the United States. Before traveling internationally to areas where malaria is endemic, travelers should consult with their health care provider regarding recommended malaria prevention measures, including potentially taking malaria prophylaxis. In addition, preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquitoes at home can prevent malaria, and other mosquitoborne diseases.

### Chemoprophylaxis and malaria death rates [^114Y54qJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The univariate analysis indicates that malaria acquired in Africa has a higher CFR than malaria acquired elsewhere. Lewis et al. have shown that severe malaria was observed more commonly in patients returning from countries in central, southern, and eastern Africa compared to those returning from countries in western Africa. However, risk assessment with reference to the country of infection is problematic, as reliable denominator data on exposure are difficult to obtain, often do not take the duration of exposure into account, and may not be reliable (, –).

While chemoprophylaxis clearly reduces the risk of acquiring malaria in nonimmune persons, the travelers' compliance in taking chemoprophylaxis is quite variable (, –). Depending on the country and the method of assessment, the proportion of malaria patients who take chemoprophylaxis is 19%–90% and has repeatedly been identified as a major limitation of preventing imported malaria. Like the recent publication by Askling et al. this work demonstrates how data originating from notifiable disease surveillance may lead to research results with important clinical implications, therefore underlining the importance of such surveillance systems. We demonstrated that chemoprophylaxis significantly increases the chance of nonimmune patients to survive imported P. falciparum malaria. We suggest that this information be used in pretravel counseling to further motivate persons traveling in malaria-endemic countries to comply with recommended chemoprophylactic regimens.

### Primaquine for prevention of malaria in travelers [^115A1mvp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

An expanding risk and range of endemic malaria threatens travelers. Primaquine is an old drug recently demonstrated to offer effective prophylaxis. Clinical trials conducted in Indonesia, Kenya, and Colombia showed that a primaquine base (30 mg per day) had protective efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax of 85%-93%. Among 339 children (age, > 8 years) and adults taking this regimen for 12–52 weeks, there was no greater risk of adverse symptomatic events among primaquine users than among recipients of placebo in double-blind studies. Among 151 subjects evaluated after 20 or 52 weeks of daily primaquine therapy, methemoglobinemia was found to be mild (< 13%; typically < 6%) and transient (duration, < 2 weeks). We consider primaquine base (0.5 mg/kg per day consumed with food) to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective prophylaxis against malaria for nonpregnant persons and those with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Primaquine's major advantage over most drugs for chemoprophylaxis is that it does not have to be taken before entering or beyond 3 days after leaving a malarious area.

### Outbreak of locally acquired mosquito-transmitted (autochthonous) malaria-Florida and Texas, may-July 2023 [^117PSUM9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Eight cases of locally acquired, mosquito-transmitted (i.e., autochthonous) Plasmodium vivax malaria, which has not been reported in the United States since 2003, were reported to CDC from state health departments in Florida and Texas during May 18-July 17, 2023. As of August 4, 2023, case surveillance, mosquito surveillance and control activities, and public outreach and education activities continue in both states. U.S. clinicians need to consider a malaria diagnosis in patients with unexplained fever, especially in areas where autochthonous malaria has been recently reported, although the risk for autochthonous malaria in the United States remains very low. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria can prevent severe disease or death and limit ongoing transmission to local Anopheles mosquitoes and other persons. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquitoes at home can prevent mosquitoborne diseases, including malaria. Before traveling internationally to areas with endemic malaria, travelers should consult with a health care provider regarding recommended malaria prevention measures, including potentially taking malaria prophylaxis. Malaria is a nationally notifiable disease; continued reporting of malaria cases to jurisdictional health departments and CDC will also help ensure robust surveillance to detect and prevent autochthonous malaria in the United States.

Pregnancy and antimalarial prophylaxis for long-term travel — mefloquine is considered safe in all trimesters and studies show no increase in teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes after its prophylactic use; chloroquine also has been used long-term without ill effects on pregnancy. If a woman traveling long-term is taking atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or primaquine, she should discontinue their medication and begin weekly mefloquine (or chloroquine in those areas where it remains efficacious) for at least 3–4 weeks to build up a therapeutic blood level of mefloquine before attempting to conceive. During the pre-travel consultation, advise women of the potential risks associated with becoming pregnant while taking antimalarial drugs; doxycycline is associated with fetal toxicity in animal studies and its use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Primaquine and tafenoquine can harm a G6PD-deficient fetus, so should not be used during pregnancy regardless of the mother's G6PD-status, and the effect of atovaquone-proguanil on the fetus is unknown. When pregnancy is anticipated, prophylaxis options might need to be adjusted; explore the possibility of pregnancy with all long-term travelers of childbearing potential before departure.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study. For randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials we used Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). We followed the guidance for making judgements on the risk of bias in five domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting and other risk of bias. We categorized these judgements as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias.

For non‐randomized (cohort) studies we assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non‐Randomized Studies of Interventions (now referred to as ROBINS‐I) (ACROBAT‐NSRI tool). We followed the guidance for making judgements on the risk of bias in eight domains: confounding, selection of participants into the study, measurement of interventions, departures from intended interventions, missing data, selection of the reported result and other risk of bias. We categorized these judgements as low risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, serious risk of bias and critical risk of bias. Where no information was provided on a category, this was stated. The criteria we used to make specific judgements are provided in Table 3.

Risk of bias assessment methods for cohort studies

For adverse events and adverse effects, we assessed the risk of bias in the conduct of the study by examining whether harms were predefined using standardized or precise definitions, ascertainment methods were adequately described, monitoring was active or passive and data collection was prospective or retrospective (Table 4). For laboratory tests and other investigations we assessed whether the number and timing of the tests was adequate.

For continuous data summarized by arithmetic means and standard deviations, we combined data using mean differences (MD). We present RRs and MD with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and report medians and ranges in tables for non‐RCTs.

### Primaquine: report from CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis I [^116vo37W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Primaquine phosphate has been used for preventing relapse of Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale malaria since the early 1950s, based on its ability to kill latent (hypnozoite) and developing liver stages of these parasites. There are three uses for primaquine in malaria: radical cure of established infection with P. vivax or P. ovale malaria; presumptive anti-relapse therapy (PART; terminal prophylaxis) in persons with extensive exposure to these parasites; and primary prophylaxis against all malaria species. All persons for whom primaquine is being considered must have a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme level checked before use, and persons who have a deficiency of G6PD must not take primaquine for prophylaxis or PART. The recommended adult dose for PART based on clinical trials and expert opinion is 30 mg base daily for 14 days, started on return from a malarious region and overlapping with a blood schizonticide. The adult dose for primary prophylaxis is 30 mg daily begun 1 day before travel and continued for 7 days after return. This review will examine the evidence for these recommendations.

### Public health response to the first locally acquired malaria outbreaks in the US in 20 years [^116pbRyZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Entomologic response was constrained by limited recent data on abundance, distribution, ecology, competence, and insecticide resistance patterns of local Anopheles spp populations. There is no national surveillance system for Anopheles species; other genera of mosquitoes more commonly transmitting arboviruses are prioritized. Furthermore, resource-intensive mosquito control capacities vary by jurisdiction and are typically separate from the health department, requiring interagency and interjurisdiction coordination.

To help prevent and mitigate future locally acquired malaria outbreaks in the US, there are several actions the public, clinicians, and public health workers could take. First, and most importantly, is uptake of complete courses of malaria chemoprophylaxis before, during, and after trips to malaria-endemic regions. Current prophylaxis recommendations are found in the CDC Yellow Book. Improving traveler and clinician awareness, enhancing medication access and affordability, and using behavioral tools such as reminders may increase prophylaxis uptake. Second, timely malaria diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and prompt public health reporting are crucial to improve routine case finding. Efforts should focus on eliminating patient barriers to health care access and educating high-risk groups, such as overnight workers and people experiencing homelessness, on mosquito exposure risks. Health care facilities could aid early outbreak detection through participation in ESSENCE. Third, advancing our understanding of Anopheles spp populations within the US, including their geographic ranges, predominant larval and adult habitats, insecticide resistance profiles, and trap predilection, may improve outbreak preparation and response. Finally, scaling up global malaria control initiatives is critical for decreasing disease burden and mitigating the rising trend in domestic importation.

### Malaria chemoprophylaxis: what do the travelers choose, and how does pretravel consultation influence their final decision [^1172RsUM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Three different drugs (mefloquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline) are recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, each with approximately the same efficacy but various adverse event profiles, regimens, and prices. We investigated which medication the travelers would have chosen on the basis of written evidence-based information and the impact that pretravel consultation had on their decision. A prospective study was performed in a travel clinic and private practice, and 1073 travelers were included; 45% chose mefloquine (Lariam or Mephaquine), 21% atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), 18% doxycycline (Supracycline), 5% "no prophylaxis", and 11% "do not know". Lariam was principally chosen because of prior experience (38%), Mephaquine because of low price (34%), and doxycycline and Malarone because of the profile of adverse events (55% and 43%, respectively). Based on objective written information, travelers most frequently chose mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis. This suggests that evidence-based information weighs more heavily than negative publicity. Taking into account the perspective of the user should improve appropriateness of the pretravel advice.

### Malaria prophylaxis in latin America: a controversial topic [^1155Kkwp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

The incidence and mortality of autochthonous malaria in Latin America has declined dramatically since the early 2000s. During the years 2002–2010, six to 17 annual cases (average 13.0) of malaria imported from Latin American countries were notified to the German authorities (Robert Koch Institute, Berlin;). Absolute numbers were declining in recent years, but the relative share stayed stable with 2–4% of all imported malaria cases in Germany. For 2009, the German Federal Statistical Office reported more than 1.2 million German travelers to malaria-endemic countries in Latin America resulting in six notified imported malaria cases from these countries (Brazil, 4; Honduras, 2), all caused by P. vivax (Schöneberg I, personal communication, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin). As a drawback to analysis, the proportion of German travelers to Latin America receiving chemoprophylaxis is unknown, but is expected to be very low in light of the German guidelines. The overall mortality rate for imported malaria in Germany in 2009 was 0.6% and is probably much lower for vivax malaria. Although the numbers might not be exact, they highlight the dimensions of the problem and confirm recent risk calculations based on endemicity data of malaria in the respective countries: to prevent a single malaria case imported from Latin America to Germany, we have to use antimalarial drugs with their potentially severe side-effects in hundreds of thousands of travelers; to prevent a single fatal malaria case from Latin America in Germany, millions of travelers would have to use chemoprophylaxis. In Germany and Switzerland, chemoprophylaxis is only recommended for travelers to certain areas of Brazil (Acre, Rondónia, and Roraima) and all non-coastal regions in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. For all other parts of Latin America, avoidance of mosquito bites and immediate consultation of a physician in case of fever during or after the journey is recommended. Travelers, who stay in areas where the diagnosis and treatment of malaria might not be possible in a timely manner, carry a drug for self-treatment ("stand-by emergency treatment"). This approach aims to avoid the broad use of chemoprophylaxis in areas of low malaria risk and therefore, from a medical and health economical point of view, might be a preferable option for tourists to many Latin America regions.

### Risk factors for mortality from imported falciparum malaria in the United Kingdom over 20 years: an observational study [^1135S8ns]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Implications for practice

These data describe two different groups of people — ethnic Africans (mainly of west African heritage), who travel mainly to west Africa to visit friends and relatives and bear the main burden of morbidity from falciparum malaria, and Europeans, who travel as tourists to east and southern Africa and to the Gambia in west Africa and have a higher case fatality. Additionally, case fatality was higher in those presenting in December, and in those presenting in UK regions where malaria is less often seen.

Our results suggest that certain groups may particularly benefit from interventions to reduce the mortality from imported malaria, in particular pre-travel advice to encourage prompt presentation to healthcare facilities on the development of a febrile illness as well as stressing the need for antimalaria measures and chemoprophylaxis. These groups include the older traveller, travellers born in countries not endemic for malaria, and those travelling on "winter sun" holidays, in particular to the Gambia. It should not be forgotten, however, that individuals born in African countries with endemic malaria still bear the brunt of morbidity from imported malaria cases, so the importance of pre-travel advice and education in this group remains. Doctors in the UK advising patients who seldom travel but take a holiday to Africa must make them aware that malaria is very common, potentially fatal, may start initially with mild symptoms and needs early diagnosis. Older visitors to malaria endemic countries, especially older tourists, are in particular need of targeting for pre-travel advice, both to take prophylaxis and to seek care early if unwell on return.

### Malaria prevention strategies: adherence among Boston area travelers visiting malaria-endemic countries [^116CC32B]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis, reasons for nonadherence, and use of other personal protective measures against malaria. We included adults traveling to malaria-endemic countries who were prescribed malaria chemoprophylaxis during a pre-travel consultation at three travel clinics in the Boston area and who completed three or more surveys: pre-travel, at least one weekly during travel, and post-travel (2–4 weeks after return). Of 370 participants, 335 (91%) took malaria chemoprophylaxis at least once and reported any missed doses; 265 (79%) reported completing all doses during travel. Adherence was not affected by weekly versus daily chemoprophylaxis, travel purpose, or duration of travel. Reasons for nonadherence included forgetfulness, side effects, and not seeing mosquitoes. Main reasons for declining to take prescribed chemoprophylaxis were peer advice, low perceived risk, and not seeing mosquitoes. Of 368 travelers, 79% used insect repellent, 46% used a bed net, and 61% slept in air conditioning at least once. Because travelers may be persuaded to stop taking medication by peer pressure, not seeing mosquitoes, and adverse reactions to medications, clinicians should be prepared to address these barriers and to empower travelers with strategies to manage common side effects of antimalarial medications.

### Malaria prophylaxis in latin America: a controversial topic [^113LbmqW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We read the comprehensive review of Steinhardt and colleagues on malaria prophylaxis for travelers to Latin America with great interest. Still, because this subject is controversial in Travel Medicine, we would like to add some information from Germany, a country not cited by the review.

Primaquine is the only available drug that eradicates hepatic stages of malaria parasites including hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. It is licensed for radical cure after vivax or ovale malaria. Only the U.S. American guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend it as a first-line option for primary prophylaxis. Therefore, the conclusion by Steinhardt and colleges to name primaquine as a recommended option for certain regions of Latin America is not based on a broad international consensus. To our personal experience, the use of this drug is hampered by several factors:
1 There is a lack of data and experience with primaquine in primary prophylaxis of malaria. Although the daily travel medicine practice deals mainly with brief regimens, most trials with primaquine have only evaluated longer regimens of over 12 weeks of prophylaxis. Furthermore, the capacity to prevent falciparum malaria, which is the main goal of malaria chemoprophylaxishas not been evaluated in larger studies. This is of importance, because in most Latin American areas with P. vivax predominance, Plasmodium falciparum co-occurs.
2 Because the drug is not licensed or recommended for primary prophylaxis in any country except the United States, the prescribing physician is liable for any damage caused by primaquine. Furthermore, in many countries, the drug is not easily available as it has to be imported from foreign countries.
3 The necessary testing for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity before taking the drug adds significant costs and together with the delay of G6PD activity reporting renders the prophylactic use of primaquine impractical in daily travel medicine practice.

Atovaquone-proguanil chemoprophylaxis — Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) is a fixed combination of atovaquone and proguanil, and chemoprophylaxis should begin 1–2 days before travel to malaria-endemic areas; the medication should then be taken daily, with food, ideally at the same time each day, while in malaria-endemic areas, and daily for 7 days after leaving the endemic areas. Atovaquone-proguanil is well-tolerated with rare side effects; the most common adverse effects reported are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Atovaquone-proguanil is not recommended for chemoprophylaxis in children weighing < 5 kg (< 11 lb), pregnant women, mothers breastfeeding infants < 5 kg, or patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Proguanil can increase the effect of warfarin, so travelers might need international normalized ratio monitoring or adjustment of warfarin dosage, and no data are available regarding the clinical impact of taking atovaquone-proguanil and warfarin at the same time.

Antimalarial drugs for pediatric prophylaxis — eligibility and safety — are delineated as follows: Pediatric doses for malaria prophylaxis are weight-based and are provided in Table 4.10.3; Chloroquine, mefloquine, and primaquine may be given to children of all ages, atovaquone-proguanil to children ≥ 5 kg, doxycycline to children over age 8, and tafenoquine to those > 18 years of age; G6PD testing is required before using primaquine or tafenoquine because these medications should not be used for malaria prophylaxis in those with G6PD deficiency; Training children as young as the age of 4 years to swallow pills using small candies or similarly sized food items can be a valuable strategy when time allows; Overdose of antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, can be fatal; Medications should be stored in childproof containers and kept out of the reach of infants and children; If vomiting occurs within 1–2 hours of administration, repeat dose. If repeated doses are vomited, discussion with a medical provider is warranted.

Travel to areas with limited malaria transmission and blood donation after travel — For destinations where malaria cases occur sporadically and risk for infection to travelers is considered low, CDC recommends that travelers use mosquito avoidance measures only, and no chemoprophylaxis. People who have been in an area where malaria transmission occurs should defer donating blood after returning from the malaria-endemic area to prevent transmission of malaria through blood transfusion (Table 4.10.6). Risk assessments can differ between travel medicine specialists and blood banks, and a blood bank might still choose to defer blood donations from that traveler because of travel to an area where transmission occurs.

### Review: malaria chemoprophylaxis for travelers to Latin America [^113cb5G8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Because of recent declining malaria transmission in Latin America, some authorities have recommended against chemoprophylaxis for most travelers to this region. However, the predominant parasite species in Latin America, Plasmodium vivax, can form hypnozoites sequestered in the liver, causing malaria relapses. Additionally, new evidence shows the potential severity of vivax infections, warranting continued consideration of prophylaxis for travel to Latin America. Individualized travel risk assessments are recommended and should consider travel locations, type, length, and season, as well as probability of itinerary changes. Travel recommendations might include no precautions, mosquito avoidance only, or mosquito avoidance and chemoprophylaxis. There are a range of good options for chemoprophylaxis in Latin America, including atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, and — in selected areas — chloroquine. Primaquine should be strongly considered for nonpregnant, G6PD-nondeficient patients traveling to vivax-endemic areas of Latin America, and it has the added benefit of being the only drug to protect against malaria relapses.

### Malaria disease and chemoprophylaxis usage among Israeli travelers to endemic countries [^111w1khj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevention of malaria in travelers to endemic countries is one of the complex challenges of travel medicine. Israel has a widespread culture of travel to developing countries, but information regarding malaria prevention is limited so far. Our study, conducted in Sheba Medical Center, Israel, during the years 2008–2018 examined malaria chemoprophylaxis usage and malaria cases in a large group of Israeli travelers returning from endemic countries with any medical complaint. Data were collected regarding travel destinations, conditions, duration of stay, and pretravel consultation. Altogether, 4,708 travelers were included in our study. Travel destinations included Asia (51%), Latin America (31%), and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (17%). Median travel duration was 26 days. Only 11.9% reported taking malaria chemoprophylaxis. Of the travelers to SSA, 41.3% took prophylaxis as opposed to only 6% outside of Africa. During the study years, 136 cases of malaria were diagnosed; among them, 82 (60%) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, of whom all but two were from SSA and none adhered to prophylaxis. Malaria chemoprophylaxis usage was found to be negligible in travel to many countries still considered endemic. Higher prophylaxis usage was found among travelers to SSA, but numbers are still lower than recommended. The low number of malaria cases seen in destinations outside SSA, as documented in our cohort, is likely to represent travel to low risk areas and not high prophylaxis usage. We urge re-evaluation of current CDC and Israeli guidelines which still recommend using chemoprophylaxis in many low-risk countries, as focus on high-risk countries may increase adherence.

### Regional variation in travel-related illness acquired in Africa, March 1997-may 2011 [^112xPABi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study confirms that the likelihood of acquiring a specific infection or disease is not homogenous throughout the African continent. Medical practitioners examining returning febrile travelers from any region in sub-Saharan Africa must consider malaria as the first diagnosis. However, febrile patients, particularly those from Southern Africa, infrequently have malaria; other illnesses such as rickettsial infections are more common and should be strongly suspected. Concern about risk and possible damage to health is a determinant of whether a person will travel to a particular destination, so misconceptions should be corrected. However, because outbreaks reported, such as the recent reports of dengue virus in Angola and Kenya can rapidly alter exposure risk, up-to-date knowledge of patterns of disease is crucial.

During pretravel consultation, prevention of illness in travelers to different regions within Africa should be prioritized on the basis of the regional profile of diagnoses. For Northern Africa, advice should include detailed information about food hygiene and rabies prophylaxis. For countries in the Southern African region, malaria chemoprophylaxis and mosquito bite prevention measures should be used to prevent malaria acquisition during travel to regions in which malaria is endemic. The travel medicine advisor should be familiar with malaria-endemic and malaria-free areas in Africa to be able to provide suitable recommendations. Special attention should be paid to travelers VFR, who are most likely to acquire malaria, and to business travelers, whose malarial infection may be more likely to be fatal. Advice about preventing tick-borne rickettsial infections is essential for travelers to Southern Africa. Helminthic infections should be discussed. Preexposure and postexposure rabies vaccination, travelers' diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases should be discussed with travelers to destinations on the entire African continent.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — primaquine (testing, indications, schedules, and coadministration): Primaquine can cause potentially life-threatening hemolysis in people with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and G6PD deficiency must be ruled out with a quantitative laboratory test before prescribing primaquine to patients. Primaquine phosphate has 2 distinct uses for malaria prevention in people with normal G6PD levels: primary chemoprophylaxis in areas with primarily P. vivax and terminal chemoprophylaxis for travelers who have had prolonged exposure to P. vivax or P. ovale in malaria-endemic areas. When taken for primary chemoprophylaxis, primaquine should be taken 1–2 days before travel to malaria-endemic areas, daily, with food, ideally at the same time each day, while in the malaria-endemic area, and daily for 7 days after leaving the area. For terminal chemoprophylaxis in long-term travelers with prolonged exposure to P. ovale or P. vivax, when indicated, travelers should take primaquine for 14 days after leaving a malaria-endemic area, concurrently with their primary chemoprophylaxis medication; if chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine is used for primary chemoprophylaxis, prescribe primaquine for travelers to take during the last 2 weeks of chemoprophylaxis; when atovaquone-proguanil is used, travelers can take primaquine during the final 7 days of atovaquone-proguanil, and then for an additional 7 days; if concurrent administration is not feasible, instruct travelers to take primaquine after completing their primary chemoprophylaxis medication; primary chemoprophylaxis with primaquine or with tafenoquine obviates the need for terminal chemoprophylaxis. Among people with normal G6PD levels taking primaquine, the most common adverse event is gastrointestinal upset, which can be minimized or eliminated if it is taken with food.

Risk factors contributing to infection — malaria adherence and outcomes in expatriates: Evidence suggests that malaria incidence increases and preventive measure use decreases with increasing length of stay abroad; among expatriate corporate employees in Ghana, adherence deteriorated with increasing duration and all employees who had been on the site for > 1 year had abandoned prophylaxis, with about half only intermittently using insect repellent and more than 1/3 never using repellent. Among British expatriates from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, they adhered to malaria prophylaxis < 25% of the time; only 25% reported rigorous compliance, and 13% reported having contracted malaria, and the International Red Cross reported low compliance (43%) among its humanitarian aid workers. A GeoSentinel Surveillance Network analysis found that Plasmodium falciparum malaria was the most frequent diagnosis among ill returned expatriate workers, occurring in 6%, and French service members deployed to the Central African Republic for 4 months in 2013 experienced malaria at a rate of 150 cases per 1,000 person-years; a survey also found that prophylaxis compliance correlated positively with use of other prophylactic measures and favorable risk and effectiveness perceptions.

### Drugs for preventing malaria in travellers [^1158yRVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Malaria infects 10,000 to 30,000 international travellers each year. It can be prevented through anti-mosquito measures and drug prophylaxis. However, antimalaria drugs have adverse effects which are sometimes serious.

Objectives

To compare the effects of currently used antimalaria drugs when given as prophylaxis to non-immune adult and child travellers who are travelling to regions with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine. Specifically, to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine compared to each other, and also when compared to chloroquine-proguanil and to primaquine.

Search Strategy

In August 2009 we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, BIOSIS, mRCT, and reference lists. We handsearched conference proceedings and one specialist journal, and contacted researchers and drug companies. We searched PubMed for drug-related deaths.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any antimalaria drug regimen currently used by non-immune international travellers.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data and assessed eligibility and risk of bias using a standardized data collection form. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using mean difference (MD), presenting both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight trials (4240 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Evidence on comparative efficacy from head-to-head comparisons was limited. Atovaquone-proguanil compared to doxycycline had similar adverse events reported. Compared to mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil users had fewer reports of any adverse effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.85), gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.7), neuropsychiatric adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99), and neuropsychiatric adverse effects (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.63), besides a better total mood disturbance score (MD -7.20, 95% CI -10.79 to -3.61). Similarly, doxycycline users had fewer reported neuropsychiatric events than mefloquine users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96). We also examined these three regimens against chloroquine-proguanil; this latter regimen had more reports of any adverse effect (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96) and of gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.85).

Authors' Conclusions

Atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline are the best tolerated regimens, and mefloquine is associated with adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes.

### Malaria… [^113Ajypj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of acquiring malaria differs substantially from traveler to traveler and from region to region, even within a single country. This variability is a function of the intensity of transmission within the various regions and the itinerary, duration, season, and type of travel. Risk also varies by travelers' adherence to mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis recommendations. Travelers with symptoms of malaria should seek the best available medical services as soon as possible, even if still traveling, and should continue their chemoprophylaxis regimen until they have a definitive diagnosis. See Box 4.
10. 1 for frequently asked clinical questions. Box:

4.
10.

1. Prevention Malaria prevention consists of a combination of mosquito-avoidance measures and chemoprophylaxis. Prevention measures must address all malaria species in the travel area.

Although highly efficacious, interventions are not 100% effective, so all febrile persons returning from malaria-endemic areas should be tested for malaria even if they took chemoprophylaxis. Preventing malaria involves striking a balance between effectiveness and safety: ensuring that all people at risk for infection use the recommended prevention measures and preventing rare occurrences of adverse effects. A risk assessment for every traveler includes collecting detailed information about travel itinerary, including countries, specific areas to be visited in those countries, types of accommodation, season, and style of travel. As part of the risk assessment, consider traveler characteristics and epidemiological features of malaria at the destination.

Depending on the level of risk, it might be appropriate to recommend no specific interventions, mosquito avoidance measures only, or mosquito avoidance measures plus chemoprophylaxis. Several factors increase a traveler's risk for malaria. Travel, even for short periods of time, to areas with intense malaria transmission can result in infection. Malaria transmission is not distributed homogeneously throughout a country, so review the exact itinerary to determine if travel will occur in highly endemic areas. In countries where malaria is seasonal, travel during peak transmission season increases risk. Recommended options for malaria chemoprophylaxis by country of travel can be found in the Yellow Fever Vaccine and Malaria Prevention Information, by Country chapter. Table 4.
10. 2 provides additional information to help determine which of the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis drugs might be best for a traveler.

### Mefloquine hydrochloride [^113n1Aa1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Malaria Treatment in Adults

Treatment of mild to moderate malaria in adults caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum or by P. vivax: Dosage: Five tablets (1250 mg) mefloquine hydrochloride to be given as a single oral dose. The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water.

If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with mefloquine failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine).

Malaria Prophylaxis in Adults

Dosage: One 250 mg mefloquine hydrochloride tablet once weekly.

Prophylactic drug administration should begin 1 week before arrival in an endemic area. Subsequent weekly doses should be taken regularly, always on the same day of each week, preferably after the main meal. To reduce the risk of malaria after leaving an endemic area, prophylaxis must be continued for 4 additional weeks to ensure suppressive blood levels of the drug when merozoites emerge from the liver. Tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water.

In certain cases, e.g., when a traveler is taking other medication, it may be desirable to start prophylaxis 2 to 3 weeks prior to departure, in order to ensure that the combination of drugs is well tolerated (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

When prophylaxis with mefloquine fails, physicians should carefully evaluate which antimalarial to use for therapy.
