## Question

In EMBER-3, how did imlunestrant compare with standard endocrine therapy for ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer overall and in the ESR1-mutated subgroup?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how imlunestrant compared with standard endocrine therapy in EMBER-3 for ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer overall and in the ESR1-mutated subgroup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and primary endpoints. Then, I should verify the efficacy results in the ESR1-mutated subgroup. Next, I will examine the overall population results. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability. Finally, I should contextualize these findings within current guidelines and competing oral SERDs to draw a clinically meaningful conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the trial framework and endpoints so I don't misstate anything. EMBER-3 was a phase 3, open-label, randomized study in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had progressed on or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, with or without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure, and it included a three-arm randomization to imlunestrant monotherapy, standard endocrine monotherapy, or imlunestrant plus abemaciclib, with co-primary endpoints assessing progression-free survival in the ESR1-mutated subgroup and in the overall population, using investigator-assessed PFS and restricted mean survival time as key metrics [^bec484a2].

> Now, I should verify the ESR1-mutated subgroup efficacy because that's where the signal is expected. In patients with ESR1 mutations, imlunestrant monotherapy significantly improved outcomes versus standard endocrine therapy: median PFS was 5.5 months with imlunestrant versus 3.8 months with standard therapy, and the restricted mean survival time at 19.4 months was 7.9 months versus 5.4 months, yielding a 2.6-month absolute difference favoring imlunestrant with statistical significance, which establishes clinically meaningful benefit in this biomarker-defined population [^bec484a2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the overall population. I need to check those results carefully. In the overall population, median PFS was 5.6 months with imlunestrant versus 5.5 months with standard therapy, and the hazard ratio of 0.87 did not meet statistical significance, indicating no proven benefit in the unselected cohort, which aligns with the expectation that oral SERD benefit is enriched in ESR1-mutated disease rather than broadly across all-comers [^bec484a2].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to ensure the benefit isn't offset by toxicity. Imlunestrant monotherapy had a favorable safety profile with grade 3 or higher adverse events in 17.1% versus 20.7% with standard therapy, and importantly, there were no new safety signals identified, supporting its viability as an oral alternative to intramuscular fulvestrant in this setting [^bec484a2].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and guideline context so I don't overgeneralize. The magnitude of PFS benefit in ESR1-mutated tumors is consistent with the class effect seen with oral SERDs, and while ASCO has historically cautioned against routine ESR1 testing due to insufficient evidence for broad utility, more recent rapid updates recognize that detecting ESR1 mutations at progression can inform sequencing, particularly favoring oral SERDs in ESR1-mutated disease after CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure, which dovetails with EMBER-3's findings and supports biomarker-driven selection in later-line endocrine therapy [^a48694f7] [^2a4b5a8a] [^1ea39105].

> I should double-check how imlunestrant fits among peers. Elacestrant already demonstrated a PFS advantage in ESR1-mutated disease in EMERALD and is FDA-approved for this indication, and imlunestrant now joins that evidence base with comparable benefit magnitude, reinforcing that oral SERDs are a preferred option in ESR1-mutated, ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after progression on prior endocrine therapy, including CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations [^ffc38ba0] [^bec484a2].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about combinations rather than monotherapy. I need to ensure I distinguish the monotherapy comparison from the combination arm. In EMBER-3, imlunestrant plus abemaciclib significantly improved PFS versus imlunestrant alone, indicating additive benefit when combining a CDK4/6 inhibitor with the oral SERD, though that comparison does not directly inform monotherapy versus standard endocrine therapy and should be interpreted separately from the monotherapy question [^bec484a2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Imlunestrant monotherapy improved PFS in ESR1-mutated ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer compared with standard endocrine therapy, with a 2.6-month absolute difference in restricted mean survival time and statistical significance, whereas no significant benefit was observed in the overall unselected population, and the safety profile was favorable, supporting its use as an oral SERD option for ESR1-mutated disease in the post-CDK4/6 inhibitor, endocrine-resistant setting [^bec484a2].

In EMBER-3, **imlunestrant improved progression-free survival versus standard endocrine therapy in ESR1-mutated ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer** (median PFS 5.5 vs 3.8 months; RMST difference 2.6 months; P < 0.001) [^bec484a2], but showed no significant benefit in the overall population (median PFS 5.6 vs 5.5 months; HR 0.87; P = 0.12) [^bec484a2]. Imlunestrant was **well tolerated**, with lower rates of grade ≥ 3 adverse events than standard therapy (17.1% vs 20.7%) [^bec484a2]. These results support imlunestrant as a new oral SERD option for patients with ESR1-mutated disease after progression on aromatase inhibitors, with or without prior CDK4/6 inhibitors [^42dc3d0e].

## Study design and patient population

- **Design**: Phase 3, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial.
- **Population**: ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer progressing on or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, with or without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor.
- **Randomization**: 1:1:1 to imlunestrant, standard endocrine therapy (fulvestrant or exemestane), or imlunestrant plus abemaciclib.
- **Primary endpoints**: Investigator-assessed PFS in ESR1-mutated patients and in the overall population [^bec484a2].

## Efficacy results

### ESR1-mutated subgroup

In the ESR1-mutated subgroup, **median PFS** was 5.5 months with imlunestrant vs 3.8 months with standard therapy (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.44–0.87; P < 0.001) [^bec484a2]. The **restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 19.4 months** was 7.9 months with imlunestrant vs 5.4 months with standard therapy (difference 2.6 months; 95% CI 1.2–3.9; P < 0.001) [^bec484a2].

---

### Overall population

In the overall population, **median PFS** was 5.6 months with imlunestrant vs 5.5 months with standard therapy (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.72–1.04; P = 0.12) [^bec484a2].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Grade ≥ 3 adverse events**: 17.1% with imlunestrant vs 20.7% with standard therapy [^bec484a2].
- **Common adverse events**: Nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and decreased hemoglobin [^42dc3d0e].
- **Discontinuations**: Low and comparable between arms [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Imlunestrant is the **first oral SERD to show a significant PFS benefit in ESR1-mutated ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer** [^bec484a2], offering a convenient, oral alternative to intramuscular fulvestrant. The absence of benefit in the overall population aligns with the biology of ESR1-driven resistance and supports biomarker-driven use [^8b019082]. These data support imlunestrant as a new standard for ESR1-mutated disease after aromatase inhibitor therapy, with or without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure [^42dc3d0e].

Background

Imlunestrant is a next-generation, brain-penetrant, oral selective estrogen-receptor (ER) degrader that delivers continuous ER inhibition, even in cancers with mutations in the gene encoding ERα (ESR1).

Methods

In a phase 3, open-label trial, we enrolled patients with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer that recurred or progressed during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered alone or with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive imlunestrant, standard endocrine monotherapy, or imlunestrant-abemaciclib. Primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival with imlunestrant as compared with standard therapy among patients with ESR1 mutations and among all patients and with imlunestrant-abemaciclib as compared with imlunestrant among all patients who had undergone randomization concurrently.

Results

Overall, 874 patients underwent randomization, with 331 assigned to imlunestrant, 330 to standard therapy, and 213 to imlunestrant-abemaciclib. Among 256 patients with ESR1 mutations, the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months with imlunestrant and 3.8 months with standard therapy. The estimated restricted mean survival time at 19.4 months was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.8 to 9.1) with imlunestrant and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.2) with standard therapy (difference, 2.6 months; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9; P < 0.001). In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months with imlunestrant and 5.5 months with standard therapy (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.04; P = 0.12). Among 426 patients in the comparison of imlunestrant-abemaciclib with imlunestrant, the median progression-free survival was 9.4 months and 5.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.73; P < 0.001). The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 17.1% with imlunestrant, 20.7% with standard therapy, and 48.6% with imlunestrant-abemaciclib.

Conclusions

Among patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, treatment with imlunestrant led to significantly longer progression-free survival than standard therapy among those with ESR1 mutations but not in the overall population. Imlunestrant-abemaciclib significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with imlunestrant, regardless of ESR1 -mutation status.

### Imlunestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy in estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: phase Ia / Ib EMBER study [^941ae641]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of imlunestrant as monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapy. Key secondary objectives included assessment of safety, tolerability, PK, overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and PFS per RECIST v1.1. Exploratory objectives included ESR1 mutation analysis and evaluation of tumor biomarkers (details are given in the Data Supplement, Methods: Assessment).

The study was approved by the ethical/institutional review board and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements. All patients provided written informed consent.

Patients

Eligible patients included those with ER+/HER2– ABC and previous sensitivity to ET or untreated de novo ABC. ER+ was defined as ≥ 1% ER+ tumor nuclei as determined by immunohistochemistry. Up to three previous therapies were permitted in phase Ia. Abemaciclib cohorts (parts A) enrolled CDK4/6i-naïve patients and allowed one previous therapy. Imlunestrant and imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib cohorts (parts B) permitted up to two previous therapies and enrolled CDK4/6i-pretreated patients. Locally determined (tissue and/or plasma) PIK3CA mutation was required for the alpelisib cohort. Men and premenopausal women received concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1.

Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic central nervous system metastasis, concomitant systemic disorders, visceral crisis, or inflammatory breast cancer. Complete eligibility criteria are available in the protocol (online only). Study procedures and assessments are available in the Data Supplement.

Statistical Analysis

Analysis populations are defined in the Data Supplement (Table S1). The safety population included patients who received ≥ one dose of imlunestrant. ORR (defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response [BOR] of complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) was evaluated in patients with measurable disease. CBR (defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease for ≥ 24 weeks) and PFS were analyzed in the safety population. Curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median and 95% CIs were calculated using the log-log method.

### Imlunestrant with or without abemaciclib in advanced breast cancer [^9801f34e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) was published by Komal L Jhaveri and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of imlunestrant in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the population was: 661 patients (656 female, 5 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer that recurred or progressed during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The key exclusion criteria were prior treatment for advanced breast cancer; visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread within the lung, or any evidence of leptomeningeal disease; symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis; serious preexisting medical conditions that would preclude participation in the study; known allergic reaction against study treatment. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the interventions were: n = 331 imlunestrant (400 mg once daily) n = 330 standard endocrine monotherapy (oral exemestane 25 mg once daily or fulvestrant 500 mg administered as an IM injection on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in restricted mean survival time in patients with mutations in the gene encoding ERα (7.9 months vs. 5.4 months; AD 2.6 months, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median progression-free survival in the overall population (5.6 months vs. 5.5 months; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.39) Significant increase in overall survival at 18 months in patients with mutations in the gene encoding ERα (77% vs. 58.6%; HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.86) Significant increase in overall survival at 18 months in the overall population (78.6% vs. 71.8%; HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in grade > 3 adverse events, serious adverse events. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer that recurred or progressed during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor, imlunestrant was superior to standard endocrine monotherapy with respect to restricted mean survival time in patients with mutations in the gene encoding ERα.

### A preoperative window-of-opportunity study of oral SERD, imlunestrant, in newly diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-Negative early breast cancer: results from the EMBER-2 study [^67cd9e1e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Imlunestrant is a next-generation oral SERD specifically designed to deliver continuous ER target inhibition throughout the dosing period. In the phase I EMBER trial, imlunestrant showed favorable safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with either ESR1 mutant or wild-type ER + advanced breast cancer after disease progression on prior ET. Imlunestrant monotherapy was tolerated across all five dose levels (200–1,200 mg). Although there were no dose-limiting toxicities in dose escalation and the MTD was not reached, there were more toxicities with doses above 400 mg. Overall, adverse events (AE) were mainly low grade and manageable; however, there were some differences in the frequency of low-grade side effects with 400 mg versus higher doses that could potentially affect long-term adherence to imlunestrant.

The EMBER-2 study assessed PD, pharmacokinetics (PK), biological effects, and safety of imlunestrant at 400- and 800-mg dose levels in patients with ER + treatment-naïve early breast cancer. Patients were randomized to receive 400 or 800 mg for about 2 weeks. Combined data from the EMBER and EMBER-2 trials determined the optimal and recommended imlunestrant dose of 400 mg for future registrational trials. The 200-mg cohort was added later to evaluate the PD effects of a dose reduction option.

Currently, there are two ongoing registrational trials of imlunestrant. The phase III EMBER-3 trial (NCT04975308) is evaluating the efficacy of imlunestrant monotherapy (compared with investigator's choice ET) and imlunestrant plus abemaciclib as second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer. The phase III EMBER-4 trial (NCT05514054) is evaluating imlunestrant monotherapy [compared with standard-of-care (SOC) ET] as adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk early breast cancer after 2 to 5 years of ET.

### Oral elacestrant vs standard-of-care in estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER + / HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) without detectable ESR1 mutation (EMERALD): subgroup analysis by prior duration of CDK4 / 6i plus endocrine therapy (ET) [^c1fa18b1]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 1070 Background: The phase 3 EMERALD trial reported significantly prolonged progression-free survival and a manageable safety profile with oral elacestrant vs standard of care ET in patients with ER+/HER2− mBC following progression on prior endocrine and CDK4/6i therapy. Duration of prior CDK4/6i was shown to be a potential predictor of efficacy in pts with. ESR1non-detected ER+/HER2- mBC is still needed. Preclinical ER+ PDX models suggest that elacestrant is equally active in ESR1wild-type and ESR1m. In the PDX model ST3932. An ad hoc subgroup analysis was performed on pts with. ESR1nd by prior duration of CDK4/6i plus ET in the advanced or metastatic setting.

Results: Among the 478 pts enrolled, 250 did not have a detectable. ESR1m. Interestingly, in 41 pts with ESR1nd that rapidly progressed on prior CDK4/6i plus ET, treatment with elacestrant was associated with prolonged mPFS vs SoC (5. 32 mos vs

1. 87 mos. Conclusions: In this post-hoc analysis, oral elacestrant delayed disease progression and time to subsequent chemotherapy in pts who did not have a detectable ESR1m and rapidly progressed within 6 months of CDK4/6i plus ET before study entry. Preclinical data support these findings. While caution needs to be exerted given small numbers, the results highlight the potential role of elacestrant in ESR1wt tumors, and more research is warranted. Clinical trial information: NCT03778931.

### Imlunestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy in estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: phase Ia / Ib EMBER study [^c597743e]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Imlunestrant is a next-generation oral selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader designed to deliver continuous ER target inhibition, including in ESR1- mutant breast cancer. This phase Ia/b trial determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of imlunestrant, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy, in ER-positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer (ABC) and endometrial endometrioid cancer. The ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) ABC experience is reported here.

Methods

An i3+3 dose-escalation design was used, followed by dose expansions of imlunestrant as monotherapy or in combination with abemaciclib with or without aromatase inhibitor (AI), everolimus, or alpelisib. Imlunestrant was administered orally once daily and with the combination partner per label.

Results

Overall, 262 patients with ER+/HER2- ABC were treated (phase Ia, n = 74; phase Ib, n = 188). Among patients who received imlunestrant monotherapy (n = 114), no dose-limiting toxicities or discontinuations occurred. At the RP2D (400 mg once daily), patients (n = 51) reported grade 1–2 nausea (39.2%), fatigue (39.2%), and diarrhea (29.4%). Patients at RP2D had received previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i; 92.2%), fulvestrant (41.2%), and chemotherapy (29.4%) for ABC and achieved a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 7.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 8.3). Among patients who received imlunestrant + abemaciclib (n = 42) and imlunestrant + abemaciclib + AI (n = 43), most (69.4%) were treatment-naïve for ABC; all were CDK4/6i-naïve. Patients treated with imlunestrant + everolimus (n = 42)/alpelisib (n = 21) had received previous CDK4/6i (100%), fulvestrant (34.9%), and chemotherapy (17.5%) for ABC. No new safety signals or interactions with partnered drugs were observed. The mPFS was 19.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to not available) for imlunestrant + abemaciclib and was not reached for imlunestrant + abemaciclib + AI. The mPFS with imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 19.1)/9.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 11.1). Antitumor activity was evident regardless of ESR1 mutation status.

Conclusion

Imlunestrant, as monotherapy or in combination with targeted therapy, had a manageable safety profile with evidence of preliminary antitumor activity in ER+/HER2- ABC.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

These data provide compelling rationale for the development of novel SERDs that can be administered as monotherapy or in combination, to improve efficacy and patient experience (via oral administration), regardless of ESR1 mutation status.

Imlunestrant is a next-generation, brain-penetrating, oral SERD with pure antagonistic properties, resulting in sustained inhibition of ER-dependent gene transcription and cell growth. Preclinically, imlunestrant has favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, is efficacious in both ESR1 -mutant and wild-type tumor models, and demonstrates enhanced efficacy when in combination with targeted therapy.

Presented here is the ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2–) ABC experience focused on patients who received imlunestrant as monotherapy and in combination with abemaciclib with or without AI, everolimus, or alpelisib from, to our knowledge, the first-in-human EMBER study.

TABLE 1.
Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics in Patients With ER+/HER2– ABC Who Received Imlunestrant Monotherapy at the RP2D or in Combination With Abemaciclib With or Without AI

Given the pretreated nature of patients who received imlunestrant at RP2D or imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib, a significant proportion of patients were found to have an ESR1 mutation (plasma detected) at baseline (56.0%, 47.6%/47.4%, respectively; details of testing for ESR1 mutations are given in the Data Supplement, Methods: Assessment). ESR1 mutation rate was expectedly lower in the CDK4/6i-naïve patients who received imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI (7.3% and 10.0%; Table 1). Per inclusion criteria, all patients had ER expression ≥ 1%, with most having tumors with an ER score of ≥ 10% (Table 1; Data Supplement, Table S3).

DISCUSSION

The phase Ia/Ib EMBER study tested doses of imlunestrant from 200 to 1,200 mg once daily, with no DLTs observed and no treatment discontinuations because of toxicity. Imlunestrant demonstrated a favorable safety profile of low-grade and manageable TEAEs, similar to other drugs in the class, with the notable absence of ocular or cardiac side effects and effect of imlunestrant on the QTc interval at all dose levels. At the 400 mg once daily dose, imlunestrant exhibited a low incidence of GI toxicities (mostly grade 1–2), sustained exposures above the EC 80 range and the fulvestrant C max, and encouraging preliminary efficacy (CBR 54.9%, mPFS 7.2 months [95% CI, 3.7 to 8.3]) in pretreated patients with ER+/HER2– ABC. These data supported selection of 400 mg once daily as the RP2D.

Nearly all patients received previous CDK4/6i, and almost half received previous fulvestrant. Clinical benefit was similar for both, at 53.2% and 61.9%, respectively. While noting the limitations of cross-trial comparisons, the efficacy of imlunestrant at RP2D compares favorably with recent trials of fulvestrant (phase III: mPFS 1.9 months)and elacestrant (phase I: CBR 42.6% [RP2D], mPFS 4.5 months; phase III: CBR 18.4%, mPFS 2.8 months). In addition, it is comparable with other oral SERDs in development such as giredestrant (phase II: mPFS 5.6 months)and camizestrant (phase II: mPFS 7.2 months [75 mg once daily]).

ESR1 mutations, especially Y537S and D538G, have been linked to acquired ET resistance, particularly to AIs. Indeed, up to 50% of patients with ER+/HER2– ABC treated with ET will develop an ESR1 mutation. However, this rate may be underestimated because of the limitations of ctDNA testing, particularly for acquired subclonal variants. Thus, serial ctDNA testing may be warranted for detection of ESR1 mutations to identify patients with ER-dependent disease where the SERD benefit may be enhanced. Although elacestrant demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS versus investigator's choice of ET (fulvestrant or AI) in the overall population and those with ESR1 mutations, elacestrant is only approved for use in patients with ER+/HER2–, ESR1- mutated ABC, where the greatest benefit (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77]; P = 0.0005) was appreciated.

In largely CDK4/6i-pretreated patients (92.2% and 100%, respectively), imlunestrant at the RP2D or imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib showed antitumor activity regardless of ESR1 mutation status. Although efficacy was enriched in patients with an ESR1 mutation (mPFS 7.1 months imlunestrant RP2D; 16.8 months/10.7 months imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib, respectively), it was also evident in those without a detectable ESR1 mutation (mPFS 5.6 months in imlunestrant RP2D; 13.7 months/7.8 months in imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib, respectively). While these observations are limited by the exploratory nature of these analyses in small sample sizes, it has been consistently observed that SERD benefit is enriched in patients with ESR1 mutations.

### Imlunestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy in estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: phase Ia / Ib EMBER study [^a87c8982]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Notably, 74.2% of ESR1 mutations detected at baseline completely cleared or declined by ≥ 50% on C2D1 in response to imlunestrant and imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI. Overall, patients who achieved a molecular response had the longest PFS with imlunestrant, as monotherapy or in combination with targeted therapy. By contrast, ESR1 mutation reduction at C2D1 of imlunestrant was not associated with longer PFS, indicating that modulation of ESR1 mutation variants, independent of other variants, may simply serve as an indicator of imlunestrant target engagement.

Our study is limited by the short follow-up duration, preventing conclusions about treatment-naïve patients with ABC included in the abemaciclib cohorts, particularly in the small number of patients with de novo ABC. Although it is sufficient to establish the preliminary efficacy of imlunestrant monotherapy and combination therapy, longer follow-up is needed, particularly for a better understanding of safety with chronic dosing along with the overall impact on patient outcomes. In addition, because of the nature of phase I studies, the reported cohorts are limited by small sample sizes.

In conclusion, imlunestrant at the RP2D of 400 mg orally once daily had a manageable safety profile with mostly low-grade, reversible, GI symptoms, suggesting potential suitability for chronic administration. Also notable with imlunestrant was its favorable PK profile with sustained steady-state exposures above the fulvestrant C max and encouraging preliminary antitumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with other targeted therapies. Taken together, these results show promise for imlunestrant as an oral alternative to fulvestrant and support the ongoing development of imlunestrant in phase III studies as monotherapy or in combination with abemaciclib for ET-pretreated patients with ABC (EMBER-3; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) and as adjuvant monotherapy for early-stage BC (EMBER-4; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:).

METHODS

Study Design

EMBER (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) is a global, open-label, dose-escalation (phase Ia) trial of imlunestrant followed by multiple dose-expansion cohorts (phase Ib) exploring imlunestrant as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy. Eligible patients had ER+ (HER2– and HER2+) ABC or recurrent, persistent, or metastatic ER+ endometrial endometrioid cancer (EEC). Recruitment occurred in eight countries and 76 centers from December 2019 to March 2023.

Phase Ia followed an i3+3 design with five dose levels (200–1,200 mg once daily) evaluated. This design is ideal in trial safety with the ability to identify the true maximum tolerated dose (MTD) compared with the classical 3 + 3 design. Initially, 3–6 patients were sequentially evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle (C) 1 (28 days) at each dose level. Thereafter, approximately 20 patients were allowed to backfill each dose level cohort.

Phase Ib evaluated imlunestrant as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents (part A: ER+/HER2– ABC, imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI; part B: ER+/HER2– ABC, imlunestrant and imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib; part C: ER+/HER2+ ABC, imlunestrant + trastuzumab with or without abemaciclib; part D: ER+ EEC, imlunestrant and imlunestrant + abemaciclib; part E: ER+/HER2+ ABC, imlunestrant + trastuzumab + pertuzumab). Data from parts A and B (ER+/HER2– ABC cohorts) are presented in this study report. Part A randomly assigned patients to treatment cohorts using prespecified stratification factors, and Part B accrued cohorts by physician's choice (Data Supplement, Fig S1, online only).

INTRODUCTION

Endocrine therapy (ET), alone or in combination with targeted therapy, is the standard-of-care treatment of estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer (ABC). - ET acts on estrogen synthesis (aromatase inhibitors [AIs]: anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) or targets the ER directly through selective modulation (selective ER modulators: tamoxifen) or by antagonizing ER transcriptional activity and promoting its degradation via ER immobilization (selective estrogen receptor degraders [SERDs]: fulvestrant and elacestrant).

Since the introduction of tamoxifen in the late 1960s, optimization of ET has incrementally improved outcomes for patients with ER+ breast cancer. - Fulvestrant established efficacy compared with an AI in ET-naïve patients with ABC, and an optimal dose was established in ET-pretreated patients with ABC, with a hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.8. - However, fulvestrant has some pharmacologic disadvantages that negatively affect patient experience and efficacy. Specifically, fulvestrant is poorly soluble, is not orally absorbed, and requires intramuscular administration, that is often painful and burdensome to patients. Furthermore, efficacy is limited in patients with ET resistance from activating ESR1 mutations, the gene encoding ERα. The recently approved oral SERD elacestrant demonstrated clear superiority (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77]) compared with investigator's choice of ET (fulvestrant or AI) in patients with ABC harboring ESR1 mutations.

Combining ET with phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) pathway inhibitors (alpelisib or everolimus) or cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i: abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib) is effective in overcoming ET resistance. The use of CDK4/6i in combination with ET has had a dramatic impact on patient outcomes for both ET-sensitive and ET-resistant patients with ER+ ABC. Furthermore, in ET-pretreated patients with ABC, abemaciclib + fulvestrant was shown to be effective regardless of ESR1 mutation status, with numerically greater improvement in median progression-free survival (mPFS) in patients harboring ESR1 -mutant tumors compared with wild-type (20.7 v 15.3 months).

### Imlunestrant with or without abemaciclib in advanced breast cancer [^33284f70]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) was published by Komal L Jhaveri and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of imlunestrant/abemaciclib in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the population was: 544 patients (538 female, 6 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer that recurred or progressed during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The key exclusion criteria were prior treatment for advanced breast cancer; visceral crisis, lymphangitic spread within the lung, or any evidence of leptomeningeal disease; symptomatic or untreated brain metastasis; serious preexisting medical conditions that would preclude participation in the study; known allergic reaction against study treatment. In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the interventions were: n = 213 imlunestrant/abemaciclib (imlunestrant 400 mg once daily plus oral abemaciclib 150 mg BID) n = 331 imlunestrant (400 mg once daily). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median progression-free survival (9.4 months vs. 5.5 months; HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.27). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median progression-free survival, patients with previous CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment (9.1 months vs. 3.7 months; HR 1.96, 96% CI 1.47 to 2.63). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in diarrhea (86.1 vs. 21.4%), nausea (48.6% vs. 17.1%), neutropenia (48.1% vs. 5.2%), anemia (43.8% vs. 10.1%). In the EMBER-3 (imlunestrant/abemaciclib) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer that recurred or progressed during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor, imlunestrant/abemaciclib was superior to imlunestrant with respect to median progression-free survival.

Imlunestrant Monotherapy

Across five doses (200–1,200 mg once daily) evaluated during dose escalation, no DLTs were observed and an MTD was not reached. Dose optimization on the basis of PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and biologic factors was performed following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The RP2D was determined as 400 mg once daily on the basis of an optimal safety, efficacy, and PK/PD profile observed in the EMBER and EMBER-2 trials (a window-of-opportunity study that evaluated the biologic [PK/PD] effect of imlunestrant across dose levels).

At the RP2D, the most common treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were primarily grade 1–2 nausea (39.2%), fatigue (39.2%), and diarrhea (29.4%; Table 2; all imlunestrant dose levels are presented in the Data Supplement, Table S4). Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were observed in 19.6% of patients (Table 2), and 9.8% was treatment-related AEs (TRAEs; Data Supplement, Table S5). Dose reductions occurred in 3.9% of patients, and no patient discontinued treatment because of toxicity (Table 2; all dose levels are presented in the Data Supplement, Table S6).

For the 60 patients with an ESR1 mutation who received imlunestrant (n = 53) or imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI (n = 7), the two most frequent ESR1 mutations were Y537 (61.7% [n = 37 of 60]) and D538 (61.7% [n = 37 of 60]; Fig 4 E). In patients with an ESR1 mutation and serial ctDNA available (n = 45 imlunestrant, n = 5 imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI), multiple mutations per patient were observed. Of the ESR1 mutations detected at baseline, 74.2% (72 of 97) cleared completely or declined (≥ 50%) at C2D1 (Fig 4 F).

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Amcenestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) demonstrated promising safety and efficacy in earlier clinical studies for endocrine-resistant, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (aBC).

Patients and Methods

In AMEERA-3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04059484), an open-label, worldwide phase II trial, patients with ER+/HER2- aBC who progressed in the (neo)adjuvant or advanced settings after not more than two previous lines of endocrine therapy (ET) were randomly assigned 1:1 to amcenestrant or single-agent endocrine treatment of physician's choice (TPC), stratified by the presence/absence of visceral metastases, previous/no treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0/1). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review, compared using a stratified log-rank test (one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%).

Results

Between October 22, 2019, and February 15, 2021, 290 patients were randomly assigned to amcenestrant (n = 143) or TPC (n = 147). PFS was numerically similar between amcenestrant and TPC (median PFS [mPFS], 3.6 v 3.7 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR], 1.051 [95% CI, 0.789 to 1.4]; one-sided P = 0.643). Among patients with baseline mutated ESR1; (n = 120 of 280), amcenestrant numerically prolonged PFS versus TPC (mPFS, 3.7 v 2.0 months; stratified HR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.565 to 1.435]). Overall survival data were immature but numerically similar between groups (HR, 0.913; 95% CI, 0.595 to 1.403). In amcenestrant versus TPC groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade) occurred in 82.5% versus 76.2% of patients and grade ≥ 3 events occurred in 21.7% versus 15.6%.

Conclusion

AMEERA-3 did not meet its primary objective of improved PFS with amcenestrant versus TPC although a numerical improvement in PFS was observed in patients with baseline ESR1 mutation. Efficacy and safety with amcenestrant were consistent with the standard of care for second-/third-line ET for ER+/HER2- aBC.

Correlation of Circulating Tumor DNA Dynamics With Disease Response

In patients with serial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) available (imlunestrant, all dose levels, n = 89; imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI, n = 41), clinical benefit and objective response were associated with deep declines in ctDNA levels (all somatic mutations) at C2D1 (Figs 4 A and 4 B). Patients who achieved a molecular response (decline ≥ 50% ctDNA) had longer PFS than those who did not (Figs 4 C and 4 D). Similar observations were noted for the imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib cohorts (Data Supplement, Fig S5) although the number of evaluable patients was limited.

Additionally, it is important to measure the downstream impact of ER degradation. The observed decrease in the tumor Ki-67 index following imlunestrant treatment (−71%) is comparable with previous observations with fulvestrant (−75.4%), tamoxifen (−59.5%), and anastrozole (−76.0%; refs.). Similar trends were observed in WOO trials with the recently approved elacestrant, as well as other SERD in development.

Furthermore, in EMBER-2, CCCA was achieved in 24% of treated tumors across all imlunestrant dose levels studied, comparable with similar WOO trials, in which 27% (n = 6) were observed with elacestrant, 20% (n = 107) with giredestrant, and 12% observed with amcenestrant. Notably, there are important limitations to these cross-trial comparisons, including key differences in baseline Ki-67 eligibility and treatment durations across both the older WOO trials of approved ET and more recent studies of investigational ET.

Collectively, the data from EMBER and EMBER-2 determined the optimal dose of imlunestrant to be 400 mg daily. This dosing strategy demonstrated biological efficacy in EMBER-2 and clinical benefit in patients with heavily pretreated advanced breast cancer enrolled in the EMBER trial. This dose is currently being tested for efficacy and safety in two randomized phase III trials for the treatment of patients with ER +, HER2 − breast cancer in the metastatic (EMBER-3) and adjuvant settings (EMBER-4).

Discussion

ER is a key driver for most breast cancers, and ET is one of the most effective SOC treatment options for ER + disease. However, novel ER-directed treatments are still needed to prevent disease recurrence or progression and to reduce therapy-related side effects.

Modern drug development efforts to select the optimal biological dose now extend well beyond MTD identification in phase I trials. Rather, it is recognized that optimization of drug dosing early in development is the key to minimizing toxicity while maintaining efficacy, particularly for therapies intended for longer duration use in the adjuvant setting, where adherence to therapy is paramount.

WOO trials have played a key role in biologically validating on-target drug effects through measurement of downstream target effects, such as inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, several trials have shown that achieving a low proliferation state, that is, Ki-67 < 10% or inducing CCCA (Ki-67 < 2.7%), with 2 weeks of preoperative ET is associated with favorable long-term outcomes. WOO studies are also important in the selection of the most appropriate dose of drugs that do not reach an MTD in traditional phase I dose-escalation trials. Taken together, these observations have been leveraged to optimize drug dosing using short WOO trials evaluating the biological effects of ET at different doses. To this end, the PD results from the EMBER-2 study, combined with the safety, efficacy, and PK results from the first-in-human EMBER study, determined the optimal dose of imlunestrant to be 400 mg once daily orally. The 400- and 800-mg doses were previously deemed tolerable and showed preliminary efficacy in the phase Ia/b EMBER study. Slightly higher rates of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were reported with the 800-mg dose of imlunestrant. Imlunestrant is now being evaluated at this 400-mg daily dose versus SOC ET in the phase III EMBER-3 study in advanced breast cancer (NCT04975308) and as adjuvant therapy in the phase III EMBER-4 study in early breast cancer (NCT05514054).

End Points

The primary end points were PFS in all patients and in patients with detectable ESR1 mutation, each assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using standard RECIST v1.1 criteria. Key secondary end points were overall survival (OS) in all patients and in patients with ESR1 mutation. Other secondary end points included BICR-assessed PFS and OS in patients without detectable ESR1 mutation; PFS assessed by the investigator; objective response rate, duration of response, and clinical benefit rate ([CBR] the proportion of patients who experienced either a confirmed CR or partial response, or stable disease at ≥ 24 weeks from random assignment), assessed by BICR and the investigator; and safety and tolerability.

Trial Oversight

The trial was designed by a steering committee of independent investigators (Data Supplement) and the sponsor, Radius Health, Inc. The trial met regulatory requirements and was performed in accordance with ethical principles consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council of Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice. An external independent data monitoring committee regularly reviewed the safety and efficacy data, including an interim futility analysis.

### Co-clinical trial targeting ER, FGFR and CDK4 / 6 in resistant hormone-positive breast cancer with FGFR alterations [^63ce1dbd]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

As expected, the clinical trial included a diverse mix of patients based on the mutational status of PIK3CA and ESR1 (Fig. 4B). FGFR-amplified patients are known to have a poor prognosis even in the CDKi+AI first-line setting. In our screened population, patients with FGFR1/2 amplification or overexpression had a median PFS of only 14.9 months in the first line (Table 1). In the second-line setting, current standards of care for non-FGFR-amplified patients have historically failed to surpass the 6-month PFS threshold. The recent EMBER trial with imlunestrant achieved promising results, but no subset analysis has been provided for FGFR-amplified/overexpressed patients. Consequently, the median PFS for this subgroup in the second line, with or without imlunestrant, remains unknown but likely low, as reflected in our data (Fig. 4A). The 3.5-month median PFS observed in our trial cohort is far from remarkable. However, exploratory analysis of the cohort using PDO co-clinical data revealed an improved outcome in the PIK3CA-wild type, ESR1-wild type subgroup (Fig. 4C, D; 9.1 vs. 1.9 months; P = 0.005). Although these results are based on a limited sample size and should be interpreted with caution, they suggest a potentially actionable biomarker signature that may help refine patient selection in future trials in the post-CDK4/6 inhibitor setting. These results should not be interpreted as definitive evidence for the predictive role of PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations, but rather as a hypothesis-generating observation that warrants further prospective validation. Critics may argue that the PDO collection was limited, and we fully acknowledge this limitation. Nonetheless, the concordance between preclinical and clinical data, together with a statistically significant association in an internally consistent dataset, provides preliminary support for the biological relevance of these findings. Still, larger, independent cohorts will be required to confirm these results and formally establish the predictive value of these mutations. Finally, other mutations potentially impacting the therapeutic regimen include AKT (observed in two patients). However, the specific variants (R121W and R406C) were not among the well-characterized activating mutations (e.g. E17K), and their functional impact remains uncertain. These findings highlight the complexity of signaling cross-talk and underscore the need for further studies to delineate the role of less frequent mutations in modulating therapeutic response.

Abstract Purpose ESR1-mutant breast cancer. This phase Ia/b trial determined the recommended phase II dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of imlunestrant, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy, in ER-positive advanced breast cancer and endometrial endometrioid cancer.

While these observations are limited by the exploratory nature of these analyses in small sample sizes, it has been consistently observed that SERD benefit is enriched in patients with.

ESR1mutation reduction at C2D1 of imlunestrant was not associated with longer PFS, indicating that modulation of ESR1mutation variants, independent of other variants, may simply serve as an indicator of imlunestrant target engagement. C.

RESULTS

Patients and Treatment

As of March 2023, a total of 378 patients were treated in EMBER. In phase Ia, 81 patients were treated (ER+/HER2– ABC, n = 74; ER+ EEC, n = 7). In phase Ib, 297 patients were treated (ER+/HER2– ABC, n = 188; ER+/HER2+ ABC, n = 45; ER+ EEC, n = 64; Fig 1). This study report focuses on all patients with ER+/HER2– ABC (n = 262) treated across phase Ia (n = 74) and phase Ib (n = 188).

Among patients with ER+/HER2– ABC, 114 patients received imlunestrant (all dose levels), 51 received the selected RP2D of 400 mg once daily. Of 148 patients who received imlunestrant in combination with targeted therapy, 85 received imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without an AI, 42 received imlunestrant + everolimus, and 21 received imlunestrant + alpelisib.

In EMBER, pretreated patients received imlunestrant as a second- or later-line treatment. Patients treated with imlunestrant (all dose levels) had a median of two previous anticancer therapies for ABC (Data Supplement, Table S2); those treated at the RP2D had a median of one previous therapy including previous CDK4/6i (92.2%), fulvestrant (41.2%), and chemotherapy (29.4%; Table 1). Among patients who received imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI, most (69.4%) had not received previous ABC treatment, and all were CDK4/6i-naïve. Among patients who received imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib, all had received previous ABC treatment, including CDK4/6i (100%), fulvestrant (34.9%), and chemotherapy (17.5%; Data Supplement, Table S3).

INTRODUCTION

As of 2020, female breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer globally, with the majority (68%-73%) of women presenting with hormone receptor–positive (estrogen receptor–positive [ER+] and/or progesterone receptor [PgR]–positive), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2–) disease. For ER+/HER2– advanced breast cancer (aBC), endocrine therapy (ET) with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or the selective ER degrader (SERD) fulvestrant in combination with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) is the standard-of-care (SOC) treatment in the first-line setting; single-agent ET alone or in combination with targeted agents is recommended for treatment in the second line, depending on previous treatment regimens.

However, acquired resistance eventually occurs in 30%-40% of ER+ tumors over the course of treatment, often mediated by mutations in the ESR1 gene after AI therapy and genomic aberrations in non–ER-dependent genes. Tumors that develop resistance to first-line ETs but remain dependent on ER signaling frequently respond to an alternative ET alone or in combination with targeted therapy.

SERDs are competitive ER antagonists with potent dual activity that antagonizes and degrades the ER, resulting in inhibition of the ER signaling pathway. Fulvestranthas demonstrated antitumor activity as first-line monotherapy in endocrine-naïve patientsand in combination with targeted agents as second-line therapy in endocrine-resistant patients, - including in patients with ESR1 mutations. However, fulvestrant has pharmacokinetic limitations (poor oral bioavailability requiring large-volume intramuscular injections, with up to 1 month to reach the steady state,) and pharmacodynamic limitations (suboptimal ER occupancy with the maximum 500-mg once monthly dose), which have been associated with early disease progressionand acquired resistance to treatment, especially in the presence of the ESR1 -Y537S mutation. The development of novel oral SERDs with improved oral bioavailability, ER occupancy, and antitumor activity may address these limitations.

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^d5cccc9e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

EMERALD was an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III clinical trial comparing single-agent elacestrant with SOC. The methodology of this trial has been previously described. Eligible patients were postmenopausal women or men ages 18 years or older with ER +, HER2 − advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had received one or two prior lines of ET for advanced disease and mandatory prior treatment with a CDK4/6i in combination with fulvestrant or an AI. Patients were permitted to have received one prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive elacestrant 345 mg (equivalent to 400 mg elacestrant hydrochloride; ref.) once daily or investigator's choice of SOC endocrine monotherapy (fulvestrant, letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane). Investigators were advised to select fulvestrant for patients who had not previously received fulvestrant and select an AI for patients who had progressed on fulvestrant. Stratification factors were (i) the presence of ESR1 mutation detected in ctDNA (ESR1 mutation detected vs. ESR1 mutation not detected), (ii) prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs. no), and (iii) the presence of visceral metastases (yes vs. no).

Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks using CT or MRI. Adverse events (AE) were collected until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. Treatment was continued until objective disease progression based on standard RECIST 1.1. The primary study endpoints for EMERALD were blinded independent review committee–assessed PFS in patients with tumors harboring detectable ESR1 mutations and blinded independent review committee–assessed PFS in all patients, regardless of tumor ESR1 mutation status.

The EMERALD trial was conducted in accordance with ethical principles consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council of Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol and relevant supporting information were approved by the institutional review board at each participating site, and each participant provided written informed consent.

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^aafcbec4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 478 patients were randomized in EMERALD (elacestrant, n = 239; SOC, n = 239; Supplementary Fig. S1). Of these, 222 patients (elacestrant, n = 112; SOC, n = 110) had ESR1- mutated tumors, had received their ET+CDK4/6i treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting, and were analyzed for PFS according to ET+CDK4/6i duration. Among this population, 159 patients (71.6%) received prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months; these patients form the overall population of the clinical subgroup analysis. The baseline characteristics of this population (n = 159) are shown in Table 1. The representativeness of study participants is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Patient characteristics based on the duration of exposure to ET+CDK4/6i were generally well balanced between treatment arms within each subgroup (Supplementary Table S2).

### Vepdegestrant, a PROTAC estrogen receptor degrader, in advanced breast cancer [^7fd993cf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study VERITAC-2 was published by Mario Campone and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Advanced breast cancer. In the VERITAC-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of vepdegestrant in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the VERITAC-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the VERITAC-2 study, the population was: 624 patients (621 female, 3 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had received one previous line of CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy plus one line of endocrine therapy. The key exclusion criteria were advanced, symptomatic visceral spread at risk of life-threatening complications in short term; prior chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease; inadequate liver, kidney, or bone marrow function; active brain metastases; significant concomitant illness. In the VERITAC-2 study, the interventions were: n = 313 vepdegestrant (at a dose of 200 mg PO once every day of each 28-day cycle) n = 311 fulvestrant (at a dose of 500 mg IM on day 1 and day 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles). In the VERITAC-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median progression-free survival, population with ESR1 mutations (5 months vs. 2.1 months; HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.33). In the VERITAC-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in progression-free survival, overall population (3.8 months vs. 3.6 months; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.45) Significant increase in objective response, population with ESR1 mutations (18.6% vs. 4%; RR 4.64, 95% CI 1.63 to 13.22) No significant difference in clinical benefit rate, overall population (34.3% vs. 28.7%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.51). In the VERITAC-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, serious adverse events. In the VERITAC-2 study, the conclusion was: in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had received one previous line of CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy plus one line of endocrine therapy, vepdegestrant was superior to fulvestrant with respect to median progression-free survival, population with ESR1 mutations.

Study Design

The EMERALD trial enrolled 477 men and postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received 1–2 prior lines of endocrine therapy for advanced disease. Up to 1 prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced setting was also permitted. All patients progressed or relapsed on or after prior endocrine therapy given alone or in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with elacestrant or standard of care, defined as the investigator's choice of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor. The co-primary endpoints were PFS in all patients and PFS in patients with tumors harboring ESR1 mutations.

Baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment groups (Table 1). At enrollment, 115 patients in the elacestrant arm and 113 patients in the standard-of-care arm had tumors with mutated ESR1.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

EMBER also explored the combination of imlunestrant with targeted therapy. Overall, the combination safety profiles were consistent with previous reports of these targeted therapies with standard-of-care ET. - Incidences of GI toxicities, fatigue, and neutropenia with imlunestrant + abemaciclib with or without AI were comparable with those in MONARCH 2 (fulvestrant + abemaciclib)and MONARCH 3 (AI + abemaciclib), suggesting no additive toxicity effect. Side effects were predictable and manageable with concomitant medications and/or dose adjustments. Diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated hepatic transaminases were observed with imlunestrant + everolimus. Notably, the highest grade 3 toxicity rates occurred with imlunestrant + alpelisib, and similar to those in SOLAR-1 (fulvestrant + alpelisib), these were mainly hyperglycemia and rash, with a higher rate of grade 3 rash observed in EMBER. Prophylactic measures were recommended, but not mandatory. Dose modification rates were also generally consistent with those in previous reports of targeted therapies. -,-

Overall, robust preliminary efficacy was observed with imlunestrant combination regimens. In CDK4/6-naïve patients, the 18-month PFS rates were 60.7% and 73.4% with imlunestrant + abemaciclib and imlunestrant + abemaciclib + AI, respectively. While several ongoing trials are evaluating SERDS in combination with CDK4/6-/PI3K-/AKT-/mTOR inhibitors, to our knowledge, EMBER is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility and tolerability of an oral SERD + a CDK4/6i and AI triplet combination. Overall, the GI toxicity with imlunestrant + abemaciclib was not worse than previously reported with fulvestrant + abemaciclib. However, clinical trials combining imlunestrant with other CDK4/6i would be necessary to establish safe dosing, ensuring that there is no exacerbation of known toxicities, and evaluate the efficacy of these combinations.

Analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population. HR, hazard ratio; PFS, progression-free survival; SOC, standard of care.

The efficacy of elacestrant was maintained when compared with the fulvestrant subgroup in secondary analysis (Figs 1 C and 1 D). In analysis excluding the six patients who had received prior fulvestrant and received fulvestrant during the trial, results remained significant in favor of elacestrant, both in the overall population or ESR1 mutation cohort, in terms of statistical significance (P = 0.0019;.0006) estimates of median PFS (2.8 months v 1.9 months; 3.8 months v 1.9 months), 6-month PFS rate (34.3% v 20.6%; 40.8% v 19.3%), 12-month PFS rate (22.3% v 9.5%; 26.8% v 8.3%), or other efficacy outcomes (Data Supplement). The subgroup analysis of elacestrant versus AI also demonstrated a similar trend in the primary analyses (Data Supplement).

HRs for PFS numerically favored elacestrant across prespecified subgroups (Fig 2). In patients without ESR1 mutation detected, a similar pattern of curve separation was observed for PFS assessed by BICR (Data Supplement). PFS by local investigator and tumor response were consistent with these results (Data Supplement).

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^294d0645]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Elacestrant significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with manageable safety versus standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2- metastatic breast cancer and tumors harboring estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutation following ET plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (ET+CDK4/6i). In patients with ESR1-mutated tumors, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of elacestrant versus SOC based on prior ET+CDK4/6i duration and in clinical subgroups with prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months.

Patients and Methods

EMERALD, an open-label phase III trial, randomly assigned patients with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer who had received 1–2 prior lines of ET, mandatory CDK4/6i, and ≤ 1 chemotherapy to elacestrant (345 mg daily) or SOC (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant). PFS was assessed across subgroups in post hoc exploratory analyses without adjustment for multiple testing.

Results

In patients with ESR1-mutated tumors and prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months, the median PFS for elacestrant versus SOC was 8.6 versus 1.9 months (HR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.63). In this population, the median PFS (in months) for elacestrant versus SOC was 9.1 versus 1.9 (bone metastases), 7.3 versus 1.9 (liver and/or lung metastases), 9.0 versus 1.9 (< 3 metastatic sites), 10.8 versus 1.8 (≥ 3 metastatic sites), 5.5 versus 1.9 (PIK3 catalytic subunit α mutation), 8.6 versus 1.9 (tumor protein p53 gene mutation), 9.0 versus 1.9 (HER2-low), 9.0 versus 1.9 (ESR1D538G-mutated tumors), and 9.0 versus 1.9 (ESR1Y537S/N-mutated tumors). Subgroup safety was consistent with the overall population.

Conclusions

The duration of prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months in metastatic breast cancer was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for elacestrant compared with SOC and was consistent across all subgroups evaluated in patients with ER+, HER2-, ESR1-mutated tumors.

Translational Relevance

The phase III EMERALD trial demonstrated that single-agent elacestrant significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy in patients with estrogen receptor–positive, HER2 − metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ET+CDK4/6i) and had estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)–mutated tumors. Post hoc, exploratory subgroup analyses of EMERALD suggest that prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months in metastatic breast cancer was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS for elacestrant versus SOC. Among patients with prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months and ESR1 -mutated tumors, elacestrant was associated with prolonged PFS versus SOC across relevant subgroups, regardless of metastatic site location or number, coexisting PIK3 catalytic subunit α or tumor protein p53 gene mutations, HER2-low expression, or ESR1 mutation variant. Prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months may help identify patients with ESR1 -mutated tumors that remain endocrine-sensitive to elacestrant, enabling ET sequencing in the second line before other targeted therapies and drug combinations, and may delay chemotherapy-based regimens, including antibody–drug conjugates.

### US food and drug administration approval summary: elacestrant for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative,-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer [^ffc38ba0]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved elacestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women or adult men with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression after at least one line of endocrine therapy (ET).

Patients and Methods

Approval was based on EMERALD (Study RAD1901-308), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial in 478 patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including 228 patients with ESR1 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either elacestrant 345 mg orally once daily (n = 239) or investigator's choice of ET (n = 239).

Results

In the ESR1- mut subgroup, EMERALD demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review assessment (n = 228; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77]; P value = .0005). Although the overall survival (OS) end point was not met, there was no trend toward a potential OS detriment (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.30]) in the ESR1 -mut subgroup. PFS also reached statistical significance in the intention-to-treat population (ITT, N = 478; HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88]; P value = .0018). However, improvement in PFS in the ITT population was primarily attributed to results from patients in the ESR1 -mut subgroup. More patients who received elacestrant experienced nausea, vomiting, and dyslipidemia.

Conclusion

The approval of elacestrant in ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer was restricted to patients with ESR1 mutations. Benefit-risk assessment in the ESR1- mut subgroup was favorable on the basis of a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the context of an acceptable safety profile including no evidence of a potential detriment in OS. By contrast, the benefit-risk assessment in patients without ESR1 mutations was not favorable. Elacestrant is the first oral estrogen receptor antagonist to receive FDA approval for patients with ESR1 mutations.

### Fulvestrant versus anastrozole in endocrine therapy-Naïve women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer: final overall survival in the phase III FALCON trial [^9ad77b05]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent data from the SONIA trial suggest that an optimal treatment sequence has not been reached for hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative ABC, which may prompt increasing use of first-line endocrine monotherapy. The significantly longer PFS with fulvestrant versus anastrozole and the notably long median OS (65.2 months) in patients with nonvisceral disease support the possibility of long-term benefit for select patients who receive fulvestrant monotherapy. Fulvestrant monotherapy, therefore, continues to be a relevant first-line treatment option, particularly for patients with highly sensitive breast cancers, patients for whom CDK4/6 inhibitors are unsuitable, or for patients with limited life expectancy and/or a preference for better tolerability and HRQOL.

Although the final OS analysis was preplanned as a key secondary end point analysis using a multiple testing procedure, the study was not powered to demonstrate a significant OS difference. Other limitations include reduced data collection after the primary analysis, limited to survival follow-up, HRQOL, subsequent therapies, and SAEs. PFS to subsequent anticancer therapy was not a prespecified end point in FALCON, which started in 2012; data on subsequent therapies were collected from approximately half of the patients in each treatment arm.

There remains a high unmet need for a novel SERD that further improves convenience via oral dosing, addresses ET resistance, and provides broader efficacy across clinically relevant patient subgroups. Several candidates have entered late-stage development with mixed results. - Elacestrant is approved for postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor–positive/HER2-negative, ESR1 m ABC that has progressed following ≥ 1 line of ET. The safety and efficacy of giredestrant and imlunestrant treatment for estrogen receptor–positive/HER2-negative ABC are also under investigation. Significantly improved PFS with camizestrant versus fulvestrant was demonstrated in the phase II SERENA-2 trial, and the phase III SERENA-4 and SERENA-6 trials investigating camizestrant as an ET partner for CDK4/6 inhibitors versus AIs in the first-line setting are ongoing.

Recommendation 2.2 — ESR1 testing in HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer There are insufficient data at present to recommend routine testing for ESR1 mutations to guide therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC (type: informal consensus; evidence quality: insufficient; strength of recommendation: moderate), and the Expert Panel concluded that there is no evidence for the clinical utility of testing for ESR1 mutations. ESR1 mutations are uncommon in early-stage breast cancer and also appear to be uncommon in patients with HR-positive metastatic disease without prior exposure to AIs, or when that exposure was more than a year before diagnosis of metastatic disease; while trials have demonstrated improved response and PFS with fulvestrant compared with AIs when ESR1 mutations were found in tumor or plasma ctDNA, routine testing for ESR1 mutations is unlikely to affect either treatment decisions or patient outcomes. Preliminary results from the PARSIFAL trial that randomly assigned 486 patients with HR-positive MBC (de novo or relapsing at least 1 year from adjuvant ET) to receive either letrozole or fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib showed no difference in PFS between the two arms. Additional considerations include that ESR1 mutations may be acquired or lost during fulvestrant treatment, and retrospective studies suggest ESR1 mutations serve as a prognostic marker for survival benefit with use of fulvestrant treatment in ER+ ABC progressing on nonsteroidal AI therapy; in clinical practice it is most common to switch to fulvestrant from AI when patients have had tumor recurrence or progression on AI therapy.

### Second-line endocrine therapy with or without palbociclib rechallenge in patients with hormone receptor-positive / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: PALMIRA trial [^1a947291]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, different real-world data studies have also suggested a continued benefit from the CDK4/6i rechallenge strategy. However, they must be interpreted with caution due to potential biases, including small sample size, patient selection, timing since previous CDK4/6i-containing regimen, and the use of a different CDK4/6i, such as abemaciclib or ribociclib after disease progression on previous palbociclib-based populations. -

The results from the above-mentioned studies raise the possibility for a noncomplete cross resistance in CDK4/6 inhibition. In addition, the ongoing randomized phase III EMBER-3 study is exploring abemaciclib in combination with imlunestrant (a next-generation SERD) as second-line therapy beyond recurrence or progression during or after aromatase inhibitor therapy, administered alone or with a CDK4/6i-based regimen. Recent results indicate that the combination of abemaciclib with imlunestrant significantly improved PFS compared with imlunestrant, regardless of the ESR1 -mutation status.

The efficacy observed in PALMIRA and PACE studies in the control arm, mainly consisting of fulvestrant, was better than previous reports in other trials that included patients resistant to CDK4/6i therapy (median PFS approximately 2 months). These results may be caused by differences in previous treatments and clinicopathologic characteristics. PALMIRA included a pure second-line patient population with no resistant criteria to at least one of the two endocrine options, fulvestrant or letrozole. As well, previous treatment with chemotherapy or other ET-based therapies was not allowed in the advanced setting. In the PACE trial, 77.0% of the patients received protocol therapy as second line and 16.0% had been treated with one previous line of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Therefore, although there are slight differences in the patient population between PALMIRA and PACE, both trials included a less pretreated patient population than other studies.

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^187dd9e3]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of estrogen receptor–positive (ER +), HER2 − metastatic breast cancer involves endocrine therapy plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (ET+CDK4/6i) as the first-line standard-of-care (SOC) regimen.

The challenge of treating ER +, HER2 − metastatic breast cancer after first-line ET+CDK4/6i is to overcome endocrine resistance. Molecular resistance patterns include intrinsic alterations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, among others, and acquired resistance mechanisms. A common type of acquired resistance mechanism consists of alterations in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene. ESR1 mutations occur in up to 50% of patients and predominantly emerge in the metastatic setting during first-line ET, particularly with aromatase inhibitors (AI; refs.–).

Elacestrant is the first oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) to demonstrate increased efficacy compared with SOC endocrine monotherapy in the randomized phase III EMERALD trial, particularly in tumors harboring ESR1 mutations, leading to regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women or adult men with ER +, HER2 −, ESR1 -mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of ET. In EMERALD, single-agent elacestrant significantly prolonged the median PFS (mPFS; 3.8 vs. 1.9 months with SOC) and reduced the risk of progression or death by 45% versus SOC in patients with ER +, HER2 − metastatic breast cancer previously treated with ET+CDK4/6i and who had ESR1 -mutated tumors [HR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39–0.77; P = 0.0005; ref.]. The PFS Kaplan–Meier curves revealed an initial drop in both arms, highlighting possible endocrine resistance for some patients in the second- or third-line setting, but then clear separation of the curves in the endocrine-sensitive setting, suggesting a treatment benefit for elacestrant in patients who have ER-driven disease.

### Testing forMutations to guide therapy for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update [^56056537]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO rapid recommendation update — EMERALD trial evidence in hormone receptor–positive, HER2–negative metastatic breast cancer — reports that postmenopausal women or men with advanced breast cancer were randomized to elacestrant 345 mg orally once daily (n = 239) versus physician's choice standard-of-care endocrine therapy monotherapy (n = 238), with coprimary end points of progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients (N = 477) and in those with detectable ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA; n = 228). Eligible patients had cancer progression after first- or second-line endocrine therapy and had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with ET, and the control arm permitted reintroduction of previous therapy but not combination therapy with targeted agents such as alpelisib or everolimus. Compared with SOC, elacestrant improved PFS in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.002) and in patients with ESR1 mutations in ctDNA (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77; P = 0.0005); in ESR1-mutated cases, median PFS was 3.8 months with elacestrant versus 1.9 months with SOC, and 6-month PFS rates were 41% and 19%, respectively. Among patients without detectable ESR1 mutations, there was no significant PFS improvement with elacestrant versus SOC (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.19; P = 0.308). Objective response rates were 4% in each arm overall and were 7.1% versus 4.7% among those with detectable ESR1 mutations (P = 0.455), while elacestrant was associated with more toxicity than SOC endocrine therapy including nausea and vomiting; the GRADE appraisal found a high certainty of the evidence.

### Imlunestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader, as monotherapy and combined with abemaciclib, in recurrent / advanced ER-positive endometrioid endometrial cancer: results from the phase 1a / 1b EMBER study [^041da434]. Gynecologic Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Imlunestrant is a next-generation oral selective estrogen receptor degrader designed to deliver continuous estrogen receptor (ER) target inhibition. EMBER is a phase 1a/b trial of imlunestrant, as monotherapy and combined with targeted therapy, in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer or endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC). This report focuses on patients with ER+ EEC.

Methods

EMBER used an i3 + 3 dose-escalation design to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) followed by dose-expansion cohorts (1:1 randomization): imlunestrant monotherapy and imlunestrant plus abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily). Eligible patients had measurable disease and progression or recurrence after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Prior fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitor was not allowed. Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity.

Results

In total, 72 patients with a median of 2 prior anticancer therapies were treated. Among the 39 patients who received imlunestrant (400 mg [RP2D], n = 33; 800 mg, n = 6), the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were grade 1–2 nausea (35.9%), diarrhea (25.6%), urinary tract infection (25.6%), and abdominal pain (20.5%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 10.3%, clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 33.3%, and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 3.8 months (95% CI, 1.8–6.7). Among the 33 patients who received imlunestrant (400 mg [RP2D], n = 29; 800 mg, n = 4) plus abemaciclib, the most common TEAEs were diarrhea (87.9%), nausea (66.7%), fatigue (48.5%), and anemia (45.5%). ORR was 18.2%, CBR was 42.4%, and mPFS was 6.8 months (95% CI, 2.1–12).

Conclusion

Imlunestrant, as monotherapy and combined with abemaciclib, has a manageable safety profile with preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients with ER+ EEC.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

In this event-driven study, approximately 340 PFS events were required in the all-patient population to provide 92% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667 at the two-sided alpha level of.025. Approximately 160 PFS events were required in the ESR1- mutant population to provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.610 at the two-sided alpha level of.025. The planned sample sizes were 466 patients in total and 220 patients with ESR1 mutation. The prespecified interim OS analysis occurred at the time of the PFS analysis with an allocated two-sided alpha level of.0001 according to the Haybittle-Peto rule. The final OS analysis will occur when approximately 50% of patients have died.

PFS and OS analyses were performed using standard Kaplan-Meier methods on the basis of the intention-to-treat populations for all patients and patients with ESR1 mutation. HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between treatment groups in PFS and OS were estimated using the stratified Cox regression model, including treatment as a variable, and analyzed using the stratified log-rank test. To ensure that the family-wide error rate did not exceed 5%, multiplicity adjustments accounted for the analyses of two primary end points, two key secondary end points, and the key secondary end points at two time points. A truncated Hochberg procedure was used to test the primary end points. Given that both primary end points were met, an alpha of.05 was passed to OS. A Haybittle-Peto rule was used to adjust the alpha for analyses of OS at two time points. Other efficacy end points were analyzed without adjustment for P values at the two-sided alpha level of.05.

### Elacestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) versus standard endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III EMERALD trial [^473893d7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This randomized phase III clinical trial demonstrated that elacestrant was associated with a statistically significantly prolonged PFS compared with SOC endocrine therapy in patients with advanced/metastatic ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer who had progressed on prior endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. The benefit was observed in the full cohort and in patients with detectable ESR1 mutations. The interim OS analysis demonstrated HRs of 0.59 in the ESR1 mutation population and 0.75 in the overall population. The final OS results will be provided in the future when data are mature. Elacestrant exhibited manageable toxicity with most AEs of grade 1 or 2 severity. The most frequent AE was nausea and was of grade 3 severity in 2.5% of patients. No cardiac or ocular toxicity, reported with other SERDs, - was observed.

Elacestrant is the first oral SERD to demonstrate improved efficacy compared with SOC endocrine therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. Nearly two decades have passed since the last endocrine therapy, fulvestrant, was approved in 2002 for patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. In EMERALD, patients receiving elacestrant had superior PFS compared with those receiving fulvestrant. In addition to improved efficacy, elacestrant offers an oral option to intramuscular fulvestrant injection. Because of the initial drop in PFS in both arms, median PFS may not be a sufficient measure of efficacy in the overall population (2.8 months v 1.9 months) or ESR1 mutation cohort (3.8 months v 1.9 months). Rather, it is important to evaluate efficacy over longer periods of time using the HR and landmark analyses at 6 and 12 months in this population. The HRs reflect a 30% relative reduction in progression or death in the overall cohort and a 45% relative reduction in the ESR1 -mutant cohort. The landmark analyses at 6 and 12 months demonstrated substantial improvements in PFS at these later time points with elacestrant. We consider these differences to be clinically meaningful in patients with limited treatment options. The magnitude of PFS improvement was lower in patients without detectable ESR1 mutation, possibly reflecting a second- /third-line post-CDK 4/6 inhibitor setting in which tumors are likely more dependent on alternate growth factor pathways and less dependent on the ER pathway, thus limiting the benefit of endocrine monotherapy. Note, the PFS results in this subset should be interpreted with caution given that this analysis was not the primary end point.

### Efficacy of oral SERDs in the treatment of ER +, HER2-metastatic breast cancer, a stratified analysis of the ESR1 wild type and mutant subgroups [^8b019082]. Annals of Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral SERDs are a novel drug class that have been developed to counteract resistance due to ESR1 mutations. Several SERDs have emerged from phase 2 and 3 trials, with the FDA limiting approval for Elacestrant to patients with ESR1mt tumours despite PFS benefit in the overall population. However, questions remain on whether patients with ESR1wt tumours stand to benefit from oral SERDs.

Patients and Methods

Manuscripts and conference presentations of Randomised Controlled Trials were extracted after a systematic search of Embase, PubMed and Cochrane from inception until January 21,2023. RCTs investigating the efficacy of oral SERDs versus endocrine therapy for ER positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer, and which reported the Kaplan Meier (KM) curves of PFS in the overall and ESR1 mutant (ESR1mt) population were selected. A graphical reconstructive algorithm was applied to estimate time-to-event outcomes from reported KM curves in all overall and ESR1mt cohorts. A bipartite matching algorithm, KMSubtraction, was used to derive survival data for unreported (ESR1wt) subgroups. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was then pursued, pooling data by ESR1 mutation status in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane Guidelines for IPD.

Results

The randomized clinical trials ACELERA, AMEERA-3, EMERALD and SERENA-2 were included, totalling 1290 patients. In the pooled analysis of the overall cohort, PFS benefit was observed with oral SERDs when compared with treatment of physicians choice (TPC) (HR 0.783, 95%CI 0.681–0.900, p < 0.001). In the ESR1mt subgroup, oral SERDs demonstrated improved PFS (HR 0.557, 95%CI 0.440–0.705, p < 0.001) compared to TPC. In the ESR1wt subgroup, oral SERDs demonstrated no significant PFS benefit (HR 0.944, 95%CI 0.783–1.138, p = 0.543) when compared to TPC.

Conclusions

The results of this IPD meta-analysis suggests that PFS benefit in the overall population is mainly driven by the ESR1mt subgroup.

### Elacestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) versus standard endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III EMERALD trial [^fab311dd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

Patients with pretreated estrogen receptor (ER)–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative advanced breast cancer have poor prognosis. Elacestrant is a novel, oral selective ER degrader that demonstrated activity in early studies.

METHODS

This randomized, open-label, phase III trial enrolled patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had one-two lines of endocrine therapy, required pretreatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and ≤ 1 chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant 400 mg orally once daily or standard-of-care (SOC) endocrine monotherapy. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review in all patients and patients with detectable ESR1 mutations.

RESULTS

Patients were randomly assigned to elacestrant (n = 239) or SOC (n = 238). ESR1 mutation was detected in 47.8% of patients, and 43.4% received two prior endocrine therapies. PFS was prolonged in all patients (hazard ratio = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.002) and patients with ESR1 mutation (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77; P = 0.0005). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 7.2% receiving elacestrant and 3.1% receiving SOC. Treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations were 3.4% in the elacestrant arm versus 0.9% in SOC. Nausea of any grade occurred in 35.0% receiving elacestrant and 18.8% receiving SOC (grade 3/4, 2.5% and 0.9%, respectively).

CONCLUSION

Elacestrant is the first oral selective ER degrader demonstrating a significant PFS improvement versus SOC both in the overall population and in patients with ESR1 mutations with manageable safety in a phase III trial for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^0d3daf8b]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The effects of tumor metastasis sites and the coexistence of common genomic alterations or other molecular expressions on the efficacy of elacestrant are of continued interest to better define treatment selection. ESR1 mutations are associated with visceral metastases and endocrine resistance. Intrinsic alterations like PIK3 catalytic subunit α mutations (PIK3CA -mut) and tumor protein p53 gene mutations (TP53 -mut) occur in approximately 30% to 40% of ER + breast cancers and confer poor prognosis and treatment resistance. The coexistence of PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations can be found in approximately 15% to 30% of patients with ER +, HER2 − metastatic breast cancer. The coexistence of TP53 and ESR1 mutations has been reported in 8% to 15% of tumors in patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2 − metastatic breast cancer previously treated with ET. HER2-low expression (HER2 IHC score of 1+ or 2+ without amplification by ISH; ref.) is prevalent in up to 65% of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. The difference in prognostic value between HER2-low versus HER2-zero expression in metastatic breast cancer is limited, and evidence indicates that HER2-low disease biology is primarily driven by hormone receptor expression.

Evaluating subgroups of patients according to prior ET+CDK4/6i duration, metastatic site, and the presence of common coexisting mutations or molecular expressions with ESR1 may help identify tumors that remain endocrine-sensitive despite acquired resistance to previous ET and thus help support clinical treatment decisions. To accomplish these goals, as these analyses were not prespecified in the EMERALD protocol, we conducted two post hoc exploratory subgroup analyses.

### Elacestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) versus standard endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III EMERALD trial [^529654f4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The study EMERALD was published by Francois-Clement Bidard and colleagues in 2022 in the journal J Clin Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the EMERALD study, the trial question was: what is the role of elacestrant in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the EMERALD study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EMERALD study, the population was: 477 patients (470 female, 7 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had 1–2 lines of endocrine therapy pretreated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and ≤ 1 chemotherapy. The key exclusion criteria were symptomatic metastatic visceral disease; any of the following cardiovascular events within 6 months of enrolment: severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, prolonged corrected QT interval grade ≥ 2, uncontrolled AF, ongoing grade ≥ 2 cardiac dysrhythmias, ≥ class II NYHA HF, coagulopathy, or cerebrovascular accident. In the EMERALD study, the interventions were: n = 239 elacestrant (at an oral dose of 400 mg/day) n = 238 standard of care (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane monotherapy). In the EMERALD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival in overall population (39.7% vs. 34.5%; HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.82). In the EMERALD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in progression-free survival in estrogen receptor 1-mutated population (46.1% vs. 31%; HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.56) No significant difference in overall survival in overall population (70.7% vs. 66.8%; HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85) Significant increase in overall survival in estrogen receptor 1-mutated population (75.7% vs. 64.6%; HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.78). In the EMERALD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the EMERALD study, the conclusion was: in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had 1–2 lines of endocrine therapy pretreated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and ≤ 1 chemotherapy, elacestrant was superior to standard of care with respect to a progression-free survival in overall population.

### Elacestrant in ER +, HER2-Metastatic breast cancer with ESR1-mutated tumors: subgroup analyses from the phase III EMERALD trial by prior duration of endocrine therapy plus CDK4 / 6 inhibitor and in clinical subgroups [^77b3487b]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Study outcome measures

In the first subgroup analysis, PFS was assessed according to the prior duration of ET+CDK4/6i in the advanced or metastatic setting in patients receiving elacestrant versus SOC among those with tumors harboring detectable ESR1 mutations. Considering that longer exposure to ET during the treatment of the metastatic disease is related to an increased risk of developing an ESR1 mutation, patient subgroups were defined according to the duration of prior ET+CDK4/6i (≥ 6, ≥ 12, and ≥ 18 months).

In the second subgroup analysis, PFS was assessed in patients receiving elacestrant versus SOC with tumors harboring detectable ESR1 mutations who had received prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months in the advanced or metastatic setting and had at least one of the following covariates at screening: (i) the presence of bone metastasis; (ii) the presence of liver and/or lung metastasis; (iii) < 3 or ≥ 3 metastatic sites; (iv) PIK3CA -mut as detected by ctDNA; (v) TP53 -mut as detected by ctDNA; (vi) HER2-low tumor expression detected by IHC; or (vii) ESR1 mutation variants D538G and Y537S/N.

Safety was assessed in the overall population (patients with and without ESR1 -mutated tumors) according to the treatment arm and in patients with ESR1 -mutated tumors by the treatment arm according to ET+CDK4/6i duration and clinically relevant subgroups among patients who had received prior ET+CDK4/6i ≥ 12 months.

Statistical analysis

Post hoc, exploratory analyses were performed using Kaplan–Meier methods to estimate the survival distribution function of PFS, without adjustment for multiple testing. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population for patients with ESR1 -mutated tumors. HRs and 95% CIs for elacestrant versus SOC were calculated using the Cox regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors, including treatment as a variable and the subgroups listed above as covariates. A landmark analysis was also performed, estimating PFS rates at 6, 12, and 18 months. All analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute).

### Elacestrant (Orserdu) [^128825bf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ORSERDU was evaluated in EMERALD (NCT03778931), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial that enrolled 478 postmenopausal women and men with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer of which 228 patients had ESR1 mutations. Patients were required to have disease progression on one or two prior lines of endocrine therapy, including one line containing a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Eligible patients could have received up to one prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ORSERDU 345 mg orally once daily (n = 239), or investigator's choice of endocrine therapy (n = 239), which included fulvestrant (n = 166), or an aromatase inhibitor (n = 73; anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane). Randomization was stratified by ESR1 mutation status (detected vs not detected), prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no), and visceral metastasis (yes vs no). ESR1 mutational status was determined by blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) using the Guardant360 CDx assay and was limited to ESR1 missense mutations in the ligand binding domain (between codons 310 to 547). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

### Elacestrant for ER-positive HER2-Negative advanced breast cancer [^fe44b03d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This article aims to discuss elacestrant, an oral selective estrogen receptor downregulator approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2023 for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) were searched from inception to August 31, 2023.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials published in English were included and relevant information regarding methodology and results were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Phase 1 and 3 trials showed elacestrant was safe and improved progression-free survival in patients with endocrine receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations who failed cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK 4/6i) plus 1 prior endocrine therapy compared with standard of care (SOC) (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane monotherapy).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison To Existing Drugs

Elacestrant maintains a comparable adverse event profile with other endocrine therapies and offers an alternative to typical sequential therapy which can delay the use of or be used after traditional chemotherapy. Elacestrant is currently being studied in CDK 4/6 inhibitor naïve patients and as a component of combination therapy for first-line use which could lead to future indications.

Conclusions

Elacestrant gained FDA approval in January 2023 and can be considered in patients with HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer and ESR1 mutations who have progressed despite therapy with either CDK 4/6i plus aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant or chemotherapy.

### First-line camizestrant for emerging-mutated advanced breast cancer [^0f008455]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SERENA-6 was published by François-Clément Bidard and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Advanced breast cancer. In the SERENA-6 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of camizestrant in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation that emerged during treatment? In the SERENA-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SERENA-6 study, the population was: 315 patients (312 female, 3 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation that emerged during treatment. The key exclusion criteria were advanced, symptomatic, or visceral spread at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term; active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease; severe or uncontrolled systemic disease which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study; known or family history of severe heart disease; pregnancy or lactation. In the SERENA-6 study, the interventions were: n = 157 camizestrant (switch to camizestrant 75 mg once daily with a continued CDK 4/6 inhibitor plus placebo in place of an aromatase inhibitor) n = 158 aromatase inhibitor (continued receipt of an aromatase inhibitor plus a CDK 4/6 inhibitor plus placebo in place of camizestrant). In the SERENA-6 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median progression-free survival (16 months vs. 9.2 months; HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.23). In the SERENA-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time until a deterioration in the patient-reported global health status and QoL (23 months vs. 6.4 months; HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.03) Significant increase in second progression-free survival (75.8% vs. 70.3%; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.03). In the SERENA-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. In the SERENA-6 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation that emerged during treatment, camizestrant was superior to aromatase inhibitor with respect to median progression-free survival.

### Elacestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) versus standard endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III EMERALD trial [^67207cd8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Endocrine therapy, with either aromatase inhibitors (AI) or fulvestrant, plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor is the recommended first-line standard of care (SOC) for locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer. - Subsequent progression is associated with endocrine resistance, which includes development of acquired mutations in a variety of genes such as erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), neurofibromin 1 (NF1), and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). - Mutations in ESR1 result in estrogen-independent ER activation and, consequently, resistance to AIs but not ER inhibitors (eg, selective ER degraders [SERDs] and selective ER modulators). Current treatment guidelines recommend sequential endocrine therapy in the absence of visceral crisis or until all endocrine therapy options have been exhausted; tamoxifen with or without everolimus is another option as later-line therapy. -, However, the clinical activity of endocrine monotherapy in patients who have received prior CDK4/6 or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition is limited, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 2 months, highlighting a major unmet clinical need in the field. -

Elacestrant is a novel, nonsteroidal, oral SERD that degrades the ER alpha in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits estradiol-dependent ER-directed gene transcription and tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, including those harboring ESR1 mutations associated with endocrine resistance. - Elacestrant demonstrated antitumor activity and tolerability in a phase I trial of heavily pretreated patients with advanced ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, including patients with ESR1 -mutated tumors. On the basis of the results, a phase III global trial (EMERALD) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of elacestrant compared with SOC endocrine therapy in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had progression after first- or second-line treatment with the combination of endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor and to compare efficacy between arms in patients with detectable ESR1 mutation.

### Giredestrant for estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-Negative, previously treated advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized, phase II acelERA breast cancer study [^6dbf5a85]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare giredestrant and physician's choice of endocrine monotherapy (PCET) for estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (BC) in the phase II acelERA BC study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04576455).

Methods

Post-/pre-/perimenopausal women, or men, age 18 years or older with measurable disease/evaluable bone lesions, whose disease progressed after 1–2 lines of systemic therapy (≤ 1 targeted, ≤ 1 chemotherapy regimen, prior fulvestrant allowed) were randomly assigned 1:1 to giredestrant (30 mg oral once daily) or fulvestrant/aromatase inhibitor per local guidelines (+luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist in pre-/perimenopausal women, and men) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Stratification was by visceral versus nonvisceral disease, prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and prior fulvestrant. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (INV-PFS).

Results

At clinical cutoff (February 18, 2022; median follow-up: 7.9 months; N = 303), the INV-PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.10; P = 0.1757). In the prespecified secondary end point analysis of INV-PFS by ESR1 mutation (m) status in circulating tumor DNA-evaluable patients (n = 232), the HR in patients with a detectable ESR1 m (n = 90) was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.03) versus 0.88 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.42) in patients with no ESR1 m detected (n = 142). Related grade 3–4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs were balanced across arms.

Conclusion

Although the acelERA BC study did not reach statistical significance for its primary INV-PFS end point, there was a consistent treatment effect with giredestrant across most key subgroups and a trend toward favorable benefit among patients with ESR1 -mutated tumors. Giredestrant was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to PCET and consistent with known endocrine therapy risks. Overall, these data support the continued investigation of giredestrant in other studies.

### Elacestrant (oral selective estrogen receptor degrader) versus standard endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III EMERALD trial [^407e488e]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

When placed in context of modern later-line endocrine therapy in the post-CDK 4/6 inhibitor setting and patients with visceral metastasis, the SOC arm's performance was generally consistent with available results in clinical trials. In a recent phase II trial, fulvestrant was associated with a median PFS of 1.9 months and a CBR of 13.7%.SOC therapy also performed as expected from ESR1 mutation clinical data. In plasmaMATCH, high-dose fulvestrant was associated with a median PFS of 2.2 months and a CBR of 16% among patients with detectable ESR1 mutation.

EMERALD demonstrated that elacestrant as a single agent reduces the risk of progression or death, as compared with current SOC single-agent endocrine therapies. Therefore, when single-agent endocrine therapy is appropriate at a later line, our findings are applicable and demonstrate that elacestrant is a more effective option than fulvestrant or an AI. In this trial, tamoxifen was excluded from the SOC arm on the basis of current guidelines for endocrine therapy, which prioritize AIs and fulvestrant before tamoxifen, clinical trial results demonstrating superiority of AIs to tamoxifen, and a desire to limit heterogeneity in the SOC arm. There is no indication from the literature that tamoxifen would have led to prolonged PFS in the control arm because of its inferiority to AIs and fulvestrant.

ASCO rapid recommendations update — background and methods — states that two previous ASCO guidelines concluded that data were insufficient to recommend routine testing for estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations in hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative metastatic breast cancer, and a targeted electronic literature search found no additional phase III randomized controlled trials; the original guideline Expert Panels reconvened to review evidence from EMERALD and to review and approve the revised recommendations.

### Biomarkers for systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^030c8517]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer — ESR1 mutations: Existing data suggest reduced efficacy of aromatase inhibitors compared with fulvestrant in patients whose tumor or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) harbors ESR1 mutations (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate), and the Expert Panel concluded that there is no evidence for the clinical utility of testing for ESR1 mutations. Although ESR1 mutations are uncommon in primary breast cancer and are more commonly detected in tumor biopsies from patients with metastatic breast cancer after at least one line of endocrine therapy, retrospective analyses reported that, when ESR1 mutations are detected in baseline ctDNA, fulvestrant improved progression-free survival compared with exemestane in patients who had previously progressed on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor; however, data are insufficient to support using ESR1 mutation status to guide treatment recommendations. Ongoing trials, including PADA-1, are evaluating switching to fulvestrant from aromatase inhibitor therapy versus remaining on aromatase inhibitor therapy when ESR1 mutations are detected in blood, and although preliminary findings suggest a possible progression-free survival benefit from switching, data have not yet been published.

### Efficacy and safety of systemic therapies following progression on CDK4 / 6 inhibitors in patients with HR + / HER2-metastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b0afcb05]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondly, we performed subgroup analyses to evaluate the efficacy of available treatments in specific, and clinically relevant patient populations. Among patients with ESR1- mutated tumors, the oral SERD elacestrant (EMERALD) demonstrated the most pronounced clinical benefit when compared to conventional ET. These findings strengthen current international guideline recommendations, which favor elacestrant for patients with ESR1 -mutant HR+/HER2– mBC, and more broadly support the conclusion that PFS benefit associated with oral SERDs is primarily driven by tumors harboring ESR1 mutations. Notably, the AMEERA-3, SERENA-2, and acelERAtrials, which evaluated oral SERDs, did not report outcomes stratified by prior CDK4/6i exposure in patients with ESR1 mutations and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

In the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway-altered group, the combinations of ipatasertib plus fulvestrant (FINER), alpelisib plus fulvestrant (SOLAR-1 trial), and capivasertib plus fulvestrant (CAPItello-291 trial)were associated with the most favorable hazard ratios. Among these treatment combinations, ipatasertib plus fulvestrant achieved the highest P-score (0.789). Notably, the FINER studyincluded only patients previously treated with CDK4/6i, of whom one hundred and one (45%) had alterations in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway. On the contrary, the SOLAR-1 trial, included a negligible proportion of patients previously treated with CDK4/6i (n = 20) in the PIK3CA -mutant cohort, thus preventing any reliable conclusion in this setting. The multi-cohort phase II BYLieve trialconfirmed the efficacy of alpelisib plus fulvestrant in patients previously exposed to CDK4/6i, but it was excluded from this NMA due to its non-comparative design. The ongoing EPIK-B5 trial, which is evaluating alpelisib plus fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant alone in CDK4/6i-pretreated PIK3CA -mutant disease, is expected to provide more definitive evidence. In contrast, in the phase III CAPItello-291a clinically meaningful proportion of patients with altered PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway was previously exposed to CDK4/6i (72%, n = 208). Capivasertib plus fulvestrant combination has emerged as the current standard of care for HR+/HER2– mBC harboring alterations not only in PIK3CA, but also in AKT1 or PTEN genes. Interestingly, the combination of palbociclib plus fulvestrant showed a PFS benefit in PIK3CA -mutant mBC (HR 0,56; P score 0.715), as observed in the phase II PACE trial. However, the clinical relevance of these findings is low, especially in the light of the recent FDA approval of the palbociclib plus fulvestrant plus inavolisib regimen as a first-line treatment option for PIK3CA -mutant HR+/HER2– mBC. Combinations involving ribociclib (MAINTAIN)or abemaciclib (postMONARCH)upon tumor progression to prior ET plus CDK4/6i did not replicate this benefit, raising questions about the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibition beyond progression in PIK3CA -mutant disease. On the other hand, ribociclib plus fulvestrant (MAINTAIN)demonstrated the greatest benefit in patients with ≤ 12 months of prior CDK4/6i therapy (HR 0.36); however, the limited representation of this subgroup, together with the absence of key comparators such as ADCs and chemotherapy, both of which are effective strategies in endocrine-resistant disease, limit the clinical applicability of these findings. Conversely, elacestrant showed the most favorable outcome (HR 0.41) in patients who experienced a sustained benefit from CDK4/6i therapy (≥ 12 months). These results align with the emerging treatment paradigm, which identifies patients with ESR1 mutations and prolonged sensitivity to CDK4/6i as optimal candidates for elacestrant. However, drawing definitive conclusions regarding treatment sensitivity based on the duration of prior CDK4/6i exposure remains challenging, as these subgroups were not consistently pre-specified across trials and exhibited substantial heterogeneity in both their definition and reporting (Supplementary Table S4).

### Imlunestrant is an oral, brain-penetrant selective estrogen receptor degrader with potent antitumor activity in ESR1 wild-type and mutant breast cancer [^bfb3c8cc]. Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Identifying novel antihormone therapies that more efficiently suppress estrogen signaling, regardless of ESR1 mutational status, remains an important goal for ER + breast cancer therapeutic development. Fulvestrant, a potent and selective SERD, has significantly improved patient outcome; however, poor PK properties and acquired resistance, including through emergence of ESR1 mutations, limit the response to fulvestrant. Studies examining the spectrum of ESR1 mutations in patients with metastatic breast cancer identified D538G and Y537S as the most frequently occurring somatic mutations. These mutations, among others, were noted to reduce sensitivity to fulvestrant, characterized by ligand-independent tumor growth and increased ER-mediated gene and protein expression compared with WT ESR1. Development of SERD therapies that overcome these challenges is needed.

Here, we describe the activity and efficacy of imlunestrant, a next-generation orally bioavailable SERD. Imlunestrant has high affinity for ERα, resulting in complete antagonism and degradation of the ER, as well as robust inhibition of ER-mediated gene expression. Additionally, imlunestrant potently inhibited estradiol-induced breast cancer cell proliferation, regardless of ESR1 mutation status. We also observed binding of imlunestrant to ERβ; however, the exact role of ERβ in breast cancer, as well as targeting of the receptor, remains disputed. Additional studies are needed to examine the functional impact of imlunestrant binding to ERβ.

### New strategies in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^1d278641]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy has led to a significant improvement in outcomes for women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Current questions in the adjuvant setting include the optimal duration of endocrine therapy, and the accurate molecular prediction of endocrine responsiveness using gene array-based assays compared with ER expression itself. In advanced disease, novel selective estrogen receptor antagonists (SERM) have failed to make an impact, although the pure ER antagonist fulvestrant may have a role, albeit optimal dose and sequence remain unclear. Overcoming de novo or acquired endocrine resistance remains critical to enhancing further the benefit of existing endocrine therapies. Recent progress has been made in understanding the molecular biology associated with acquired endocrine resistance, including adaptive "cross-talk" between ER and peptide growth factor receptor pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Future strategies that are being evaluated include combining endocrine therapy with inhibitors of growth factor receptors or downstream signaling pathways, to treat or prevent critical resistance pathways that become operative in ER+ tumors. Preclinical experiments have provided great promise for this approach, although clinical data remain mixed. Enriching trial recruitment by molecular profiling of different ER+ subtypes will become increasingly important to maximize additional benefit that new agents may bring to current endocrine therapies for breast cancer.

### Elacestrant (Orserdu) [^0bf70cf1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by a blinded imaging review committee (BIRC). An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).

A statistically significant difference in PFS was observed in the intention to treat (ITT) population and in the subgroup of patients with ESR1 mutations. An exploratory analysis of PFS in the 250 (52%) patients without ESR1 mutations showed a HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.19) indicating that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results seen in the ESR1 mutated population.

Among the patients with ESR1 mutations (n = 228), the median age was 63 years (range: 28–89); 100% were female; 72% were White, 5.7% Asian, 3.5% Black, 0.4% Other, 18.4% unknown/not reported; 8.8% were Hispanic/Latino; and baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (57%) or 1 (43%). Most patients had visceral disease (71%); 62% had received 1 line of endocrine therapy and 39% had received 2 lines of endocrine therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting. All patients had received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, 24% had received prior fulvestrant, and 25% had received prior chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.

Efficacy results are presented in Table 7 and Figure 1 for patients with ESR1 mutations.

### Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer after progression on CDK4 / 6 inhibition: results from the phase III postMONARCH trial [^7d4a0ee6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) combined with endocrine therapy (ET) are the standard first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC); however, disease progression occurs in almost all patients and additional treatment options are needed. Herein, we report outcomes of the postMONARCH trial investigating a switch in ET with/without CDK4/6 inhibition with abemaciclib after disease progression on CDK4/6i.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized phase III study enrolled patients with disease progression on previous CDK4/6i plus aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy for advanced disease or recurrence on/after adjuvant CDK4/6i + ET. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to abemaciclib + fulvestrant or placebo + fulvestrant. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included PFS by blinded independent central review, objective response rate (ORR), and safety.

Results

This study randomly assigned 368 patients (abemaciclib + fulvestrant, n = 182 placebo + fulvestrant, n = 186). At the primary analysis (258 events), the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.95; nominal P = 0.017), with median PFS 6.0 (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.6) versus 5.3 (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.6) months and 6-month PFS rates of 50% and 37% in the abemaciclib + fulvestrant and placebo + fulvestrant arms, respectively. These results were supported by BICR-assessed PFS (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77]; nominal P < .001). A consistent treatment effect was seen across major clinical and genomic subgroups, including with/without ESR1 or PIK3CA mutations. Among patients with measurable disease, investigator-assessed ORR was improved with abemaciclib + fulvestrant versus placebo + fulvestrant (17% v 7%; nominal P = 0.015). No new safety signals were observed, with findings consistent with the known safety profile of abemaciclib.

Conclusion

Abemaciclib + fulvestrant significantly improved PFS after disease progression on previous CDK4/6i + ET in patients with HR+, HER2- ABC, offering an additional targeted therapy option for these patients.

### Elacestrant improves progression-free survival after endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer [^651e6e69]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Endocrine therapy in combination with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor has emerged as the standard of care for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. However, most patients will experience disease progression on first-line therapy related to the development of treatment resistance, including resistance secondary to the development of ESR1 mutations.

After progression on first-line therapy, options for patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer include sequential endocrine therapy, with the goal of exhausting available endocrine therapies before switching to chemotherapy. Standard single-agent endocrine therapies such as fulvestrant are associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS), averaging approximately 2 months in the second- and third-line settings.

Elacestrant is an investigational, oral, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that demonstrates antitumor activity in ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibition. Elacestrant also shows activity in tumors harboring ESR1 mutations. The phase III EMERALD trial was designed to evaluate elacestrant in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancers that progressed on prior treatment with endocrine and targeted therapies.

### Overall survival with palbociclib and fulvestrant in women with HR + / HER2-ABC: updated exploratory analyses of PALOMA-3, a double-blind, phase III randomized study [^3a80b986]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current analysis, regardless of mutation status, palbociclib plus fulvestrant prolonged OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant. Moreover, palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant regardless of ESR1, PIK3CA, or TP53 mutation status. Overall, findings were similar whether mutations were analyzed at day 1, at end of treatment, or at day 1 and end of treatment combined. These findings are consistent with results from a previous analysis that demonstrated that palbociclib plus fulvestrant prolonged median PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant both in patients with ESR1 mutations [9.4 vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25–0.74)] and without ESR1 mutations [9.5 vs. 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.35–0.70)]. Our findings are also consistent with results from the MONARCH 2 study in which abemaciclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients regardless of ESR1 or PIK3CA mutation status. In the current analysis, patients with ESR1 mutations gained a greater benefit from palbociclib plus fulvestrant measured by both PFS and OS. Future research is warranted to further characterize genomic features that may affect the efficacy of palbociclib plus fulvestrant.

Limitations of this study include that it is an exploratory analysis. This study is also limited by the small numbers of patients included in some of the subgroups analyzed. Nevertheless, with > 6 years of median follow-up in patients with HR + /HER2 − ABC, palbociclib plus fulvestrant demonstrated longer OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant, including in most of the subgroups assessed and regardless of ESR1, PIK3CA, or TP53 mutation status.

Conclusions

In patients with HR + /HER2 − ABC who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy, the clinically meaningful improvement in OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant was maintained with > 6 years of follow-up, regardless of genomic alterations, and no new safety signals were identified. These findings support palbociclib plus fulvestrant as a standard of care in patients with HR + /HER2 − ABC. Moreover, ESR1, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutational status can provide prognostic value in this clinical setting.

### Efficacy and safety of systemic therapies following progression on CDK4 / 6 inhibitors in patients with HR + / HER2-metastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8d80d761]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the absence of head-to-head trials, optimal treatment sequencing following disease progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) combined with endocrine therapy (ET) in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) remains challenging. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to provide evidence-based guidance for treatment selection in this setting.

Methods

We identified randomized phase II-III trials involving HR+/HER2- mBC patients whose tumors progressed on CDK4/6i-based therapy, published between January 1, 2014 and June 6, 2025 (PROSPERO n° CRD42024604417). Hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted from published data and analyzed using a frequentist random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the duration of CDK4/6i treatment and the presence of ESR1 or PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway alterations. Treatments were compared with conventional ET or chemotherapy and ranked using the P-score metric. Confidence in network estimates was evaluated using the CINeMA framework. Safety data, including grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuation, were descriptively analyzed.

Findings

Twenty-eight randomized trials (n = 6544) were included in the NMA. Sapanisertib plus fulvestrant provided the greatest PFS benefit (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14–0.82) but had a high discontinuation rate (> 15%). Among the approved therapies, ribociclib plus ET (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39–0.84), capivasertib plus fulvestrant (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51–0.75), and elacestrant (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89) demonstrated superior efficacy. Elacestrant was most effective in patients with ESR1 -mutant tumors and among patients with prolonged prior CDK4/6i exposure. Ipatasertib and alpelisib showed the greatest benefits in patients with PI3K/PTEN/AKT alterations. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab deruxtecan and sacituzumab govitecan, outperformed standard chemotherapy, albeit with higher toxicity.

Interpretation

Combinations of targeted agents with ET or novel endocrine agents such as oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety profiles in biomarker-selected populations, supporting a shift toward biomarker-driven treatment algorithms. In endocrine-resistant diseases that require chemotherapy, ADCs are the most effective therapeutic option.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to genetic testing (ESR1), ASCO 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain routine testing for the emergence of ESR1 mutations at recurrence or progression on endocrine therapy (given with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor) to aid in treatment selection in patients with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Obtain ESR1 mutation testing on blood or tissue samples obtained at the time of progression, as ESR1 mutations develop in response to selection pressure during treatment and are typically undetectable in the primary tumor.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our NMA demonstrated that the combination of CDK4/6i and ET exhibits superior efficacy in first-line treatment, albeit at the expense of increased adverse events. Notably, enhanced benefits were observed in patients under 65 and within the Asian demographic. The combination of CDK4/6i and SERD displayed remarkable efficacy in second/further-line treatment, and the addition of ICI might enhance this efficacy, notwithstanding discrepancies in the Cox-PH model results. Furthermore, while there are PFS benefits associated with drugs such as Sapanisertib and Buparlisib, their development is hindered by toxicity. Noteworthy PFS improvements were observed in PIK3CA and ESR1 mutation patients treated with Capivasertib, Alpelisib, Camizestrant, and Elacestrant. Further research is necessary to determine the most effective treatment strategies in the HR + /HER2 − advanced breast cancer, and sequencing of these therapies is crucial. Additionally, more trials comparing these novel treatments are warranted to reduce uncertainty in these results.

### Vepdegestrant, a PROTAC estrogen receptor degrader, in advanced breast cancer [^1efc259a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vepdegestrant is an oral proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) estrogen receptor (ER) degrader that directly harnesses the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Methods

In this phase 3, open-label, randomized trial, we enrolled patients with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer who had received one previous line of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor therapy plus one line of endocrine therapy (and up to one additional line of endocrine therapy). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vepdegestrant at a dose of 200 mg orally once every day of each 28-day cycle or fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg, administered intramuscularly, on day 1 and day 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles, with randomization stratified according to ESR1 -mutation status and presence or absence of visceral disease. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review among the patients with ESR1 mutations and among all the patients who underwent randomization. Progression-free survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods and hazard ratios with a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model.

Results

A total of 624 patients underwent randomization; 313 were assigned to receive vepdegestrant, and 311 to receive fulvestrant. Among the 270 patients with ESR1 mutations, the median progression-free survival was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7 to 7.4) with vepdegestrant and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.5) with fulvestrant (hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78]; P < 0.001). Among all the patients, the median progression-free survival was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.3) with vepdegestrant and 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.0) with fulvestrant (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.01]; P = 0.07). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 23.4% of the patients in the vepdegestrant group and in 17.6% of the patients in the fulvestrant group. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 2.9% and 0.7% of the patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Among patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, vepdegestrant was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival than fulvestrant in the subgroup with ESR1 mutations but not in the full patient population.

### FDA approves imlunestrant for ER-positive, HER2-negative, ESR1… [^42dc3d0e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

FDA also approved the Guardant360 CDx assay as a companion diagnostic device to identify patients with breast cancer with ESR1 mutations for treatment with imlunestrant. Full prescribing information for Inluriyo will be posted on Drugs@FDA. Efficacy and Safety Efficacy was evaluated in EMBER-3, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial that enrolled 874 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor either alone or in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Patients were excluded if they were eligible to receive a PARP inhibitor. Patients were randomized 1: 1: 1 to imlunestrant, an investigator's choice of endocrine therapy, or an additional investigational combination regimen. Randomization was stratified by previous treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, presence of visceral metastasis, and geographic region.

ESR1 mutational status was determined by blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid analysis using the Guardant360 CDx assay and was limited to specific ESR1 mutations in the ligand-binding domain. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival comparing imlunestrant to the investigator's choice of endocrine therapy in patients with. ESR1 mutated tumors. Other efficacy outcome measures included overall survival and objective response rate. In the ESR1 mutated population, a statistically significant difference in investigator-assessed PFS for imlunestrant compared to investigator's choice of endocrine therapy was observed. The ORR was 14. 3% in the imlunestrant arm and
7. 7% in the investigator's choice arm. At the time of the PFS analysis, OS data was immature with 31% of deaths in the ESR1 mutated population.

The most common adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities were decreased hemoglobin, musculoskeletal pain, decreased calcium, decreased neutrophils, increased AST, fatigue, diarrhea, increased ALT, increased triglycerides, nausea, decreased platelets, constipation, increased cholesterol, and abdominal pain.

### Clinical significance of PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA: analysis from the MONARCH 2 study of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant [^ad1b284e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations have been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC). Inhibition of CDK4 and 6 has been hypothesized as a therapeutic strategy to overcome endocrine resistance in patients with PIK3CA- or ESR1-mutant breast cancers. The objective of this exploratory analysis was to assess efficacy of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant in patients with or without PIK3CA or ESR1 mutations in MONARCH 2.

Patients and Methods

MONARCH 2 was a global, randomized, double-blind phase III trial of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant in 669 women with HR+, HER2- ABC, which had progressed on ET. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Exploratory analyses assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and other endpoints, in patients with or without PIK3CA or ESR1 mutations detectable in baseline ctDNA.

Results

From the MONARCH 2 population, 219 and 248 patient samples were successfully analyzed for either PIK3CA or ESR1 mutations, respectively. Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in both PIK3CA-wild-type (median 16.9 months vs. 12.3 months; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.78) and PIK3CA-mutant subgroups (median 17.1 months vs. 5.7 months; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33–0.84), as well as both ESR1-wild-type (median 15.3 months vs. 11.2 months; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27–0.71) and ESR1-mutant subgroups (median 20.7 months vs. 13.1 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37–0.79). Additional endpoints, including OS, were also improved following treatment with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant regardless of PIK3CA or ESR1 mutation status.

Conclusions

Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant was effective regardless of PIK3CA or ESR1 mutation status, with benefit in both PFS and OS, with a numerically greater improvement in median PFS relative to placebo plus fulvestrant for PIK3CA- or ESR1-mutant tumors compared with the respective wild-type subgroups, in women with HR+, HER2- ABC that had progressed on ET.

### Endocrine therapy considerations in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative advanced breast cancers [^b3b46335]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy alone

Tamoxifen has long been established as an effective first line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC. Phase III trials then compared AIs or fulvestrant to tamoxifen in such patients demonstrating equivalent or superior efficacy to tamoxifen, being equally well tolerated, and AIs have become the standard of care in first line. More recent data suggests that fulvestrant may be superior to AIs in this setting. The phase II randomized Fulvestrant fIRst-line STudy (FIRST) trial compared fulvestrant high dose (500 mg) to anastrozole for first line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ ABC. Clinical benefit rate, the primary study endpoint was similar for the two groups. However, at the time of a more mature follow-up, median time to progression (TTP) was significantly longer for the patients receiving fulvestrant (23.4 vs. 13.1 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.92; P = 0.01). Updated results, recently presented, showed that also median overall survival (OS) was significantly longer for fulvestrant (54.1 months) versus anastrozole (48.4 months; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50–0.98; P = 0.041). These results require confirmation in a phase III trial, which is currently underway.

Preferred regimens for second and subsequent lines — Fulvestrant in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor may be offered to patients who experienced disease progression during prior treatment with AIs with or without one line of prior chemotherapy (category 1), because PFS was improved compared with fulvestrant alone in a phase III trial (PALOMA-3), and treatment should be limited to those without prior exposure to CDK 4/6 inhibitors. The PALOMA-3 compared the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant to fulvestrant in pre- or postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, whose disease progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy.

### Fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg for the first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer: overall survival analysis from the phase II FIRST study [^52c90e33]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare overall survival (OS) for fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole as first-line endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer.

Patients and Methods

The Fulvestrant First-Line Study Comparing Endocrine Treatments (FIRST) was a phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial. Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer who had no previous therapy for advanced disease received either fulvestrant 500 mg (days 0, 14, 28, and every 28 days thereafter) or anastrozole 1 mg (daily). The primary end point (clinical benefit rate [72.5% and 67.0%]) and a follow-up analysis (median time to progression [23.4 months and 13.1 months]) have been reported previously for fulvestrant 500 mg and anastrozole, respectively. Subsequently, the protocol was amended to assess OS by unadjusted log-rank test after approximately 65% of patients had died. Treatment effect on OS across several subgroups was examined. Tolerability was evaluated by adverse event monitoring.

Results

In total, 205 patients were randomly assigned (fulvestrant 500 mg, n = 102; anastrozole, n = 103). At data cutoff, 61.8% (fulvestrant 500 mg, n = 63) and 71.8% (anastrozole, n = 74) had died. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for OS with fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole was 0.70 (0.50 to 0.98; P = 0.04; median OS, 54.1 months v 48.4 months). Treatment effects seemed generally consistent across the subgroups analyzed. No new safety issues were observed.

Conclusion

There are several limitations of this OS analysis, including that it was not planned in the original protocol but instead was added after time-to-progression results were analyzed, and that not all patients participated in additional OS follow-up. However, the present results suggest fulvestrant 500 mg extends OS versus anastrozole. This finding now awaits prospective confirmation in the larger phase III FALCON (Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Compared in Hormonal Therapy Naïve Advanced Breast Cancer) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01602380).

### Palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy versus capecitabine in hormonal receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative, aromatase inhibitor-resistant metastatic breast cancer: a phase III randomised controlled trial-PEARL [^200a32c0]. Annals of Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) is the standard treatment of hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, its efficacy has not been compared with that of chemotherapy in a phase III trial.

Patients and Methods

PEARL is a multicentre, phase III randomised study in which patients with aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant MBC were included in two consecutive cohorts. In cohort 1, patients were randomised 1: 1 to palbociclib plus exemestane or capecitabine. On discovering new evidence about estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) mutations inducing resistance to AIs, the trial was amended to include cohort 2, in which patients were randomised 1: 1 between palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine. The stratification criteria were disease site, prior sensitivity to ET, prior chemotherapy for MBC, and country of origin. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in cohort 2 and in wild-type ESR1 patients (cohort 1 + cohort 2). ESR1 hotspot mutations were analysed in baseline circulating tumour DNA.

Results

From March 2014 to July 2018, 296 and 305 patients were included in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively. Palbociclib plus ET was not superior to capecitabine in both cohort 2 [median PFS: 7.5 versus 10.0 months; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85–1.50] and wild-type ESR1 patients (median PFS: 8.0 versus 10.6 months; aHR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.87–1.41). The most frequent grade 3–4 toxicities with palbociclib plus exemestane, palbociclib plus fulvestrant and capecitabine, respectively, were neutropenia (57.4%, 55.7% and 5.5%), hand/foot syndrome (0%, 0% and 23.5%), and diarrhoea (1.3%, 1.3% and 7.6%). Palbociclib plus ET offered better quality of life (aHR for time to deterioration of global health status: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53–0.85).

Conclusions

There was no statistical superiority of palbociclib plus ET over capecitabine with respect to PFS in MBC patients resistant to AIs. Palbociclib plus ET showed a better safety profile and improved quality of life.

### Testing forMutations to guide therapy for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update [^1ea39105]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO rapid recommendation — ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) mutation testing and endocrine therapy sequencing: Testing with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified assay should be performed on blood or tissue obtained at the time of progression, and blood-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is preferred owing to greater sensitivity; if not performed earlier, testing for PIK3CA mutations should also be performed to guide further therapy. Patients whose tumor or ctDNA tests remain ESR1 wild-type may warrant retesting at subsequent progression(s) to determine if an ESR1 mutation has arisen (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong). For patients previously treated with endocrine therapy (ET) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor who continue endocrine-based approaches, ESR1 wild-type tumors have subsequent ET options including fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitor, or tamoxifen monotherapy, or ET in combination with targeted agents such as alpelisib (for PIK3CA-mutated tumors), or everolimus; for detectable ESR1 mutation, options include elacestrant, or other ET alone or with targeted agents such as alpelisib (for PIK3CA-mutated tumors) or everolimus, although there are at present no data to support the safety or clinical efficacy of elacestrant in combination with targeted agents.

### Fulvestrant versus anastrozole in endocrine therapy-Naïve women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer: final overall survival in the phase III FALCON trial [^23ac7cf5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approval of the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant for endocrine therapy (ET)–naïve postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) was based on the phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) FALCON (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). In 2016, FALCON met its primary end point, demonstrating significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with fulvestrant 500 mg versus the third-generation aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole 1 mg.PFS benefits with fulvestrant were largely consistent across predefined patient subgroups. Treatment was well tolerated, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was maintained in both arms.

At the time of the primary PFS analysis, interim analysis of overall survival (OS) in FALCON showed no significant difference between arms. Herein, we report the prespecified final OS analysis from FALCON and updated safety information.
