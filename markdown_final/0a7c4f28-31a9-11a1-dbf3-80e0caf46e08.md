Hepatic adjustment tylenol

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acetaminophen (Tylenol) dose adjustments in hepatic impairment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and hepatotoxicity mechanism to anchor risk. Then, I should verify how hepatic impairment alters acetaminophen disposition. Next, I will stratify recommendations by Child-Pugh class and reconcile any conflicting guidance. After that, I should consider special populations and practical dosing strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation and note monitoring and safety counseling points, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against labels and guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and toxicity framework. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction oxidized by CYP2E1 to NAPQI, a reactive intermediate that can cause hepatocellular injury when glutathione is depleted; this is dose-dependent and typically manifests when total daily intake exceeds 4,000 mg or when repeated supratherapeutic dosing occurs, especially in susceptible hosts [^113bQRHE] [^115Y2yEc] [^114sk8CU].

> Wait, let me verify how hepatic impairment changes exposure. In cirrhosis, portal shunting reduces first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance, and glutathione stores may be diminished, which together can increase NAPQI exposure and susceptibility to injury even at therapeutic doses; this is why labels advise caution and often recommend lower total daily doses in liver disease, even though acetaminophen is not extensively protein-bound and does not accumulate in a classic sense [^113QTqJB] [^113bQRHE] [^1127GhsU].

> I will now examine the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling states acetaminophen is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease, and should be used with caution in hepatic impairment or active liver disease, with a reduced total daily dose considered; this applies across oral, rectal, and IV formulations, and the maximum daily dose of 4,000 mg must never be exceeded when combining all sources [^114A11bm] [^113bQRHE] [^1159vpjH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose caps in mild disease. I initially thought to cap at 2,000–3,000 mg/day for Child-Pugh A, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. The 2,000–3,000 mg/day figure is a conservative, commonly cited range in reviews and practice guidance for patients with liver disease, including those with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, and is echoed in pain guidelines for patients with liver disease; however, this is not a label-specified cap, so I need to frame it as a prudent, risk-mitigating approach rather than a regulatory mandate [^116tuJdq] [^111Wzope].

> Next, I should review Child-Pugh stratification. For Child-Pugh A (mild), use with caution and consider a reduced total daily dose, often 2,000–3,000 mg/day in practice. For Child-Pugh B (moderate), use with caution and generally keep total daily dose at or below 2,000 mg/day. For Child-Pugh C (severe), acetaminophen is contraindicated and should be avoided. I need to ensure I align this with both FDA labeling and hepatology guidance that emphasizes individualized risk–benefit assessment in cirrhosis [^114A11bm] [^116tuJdq] [^116urmcs].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In older adults, many clinicians further lower the daily maximum toward 2,000–3,000 mg even without overt liver disease due to reduced hepatic reserve and polypharmacy; in patients with alcohol use disorder, short-term therapeutic dosing has been studied without clear signal for harm, yet chronic heavy use lowers glutathione and increases risk, so conservative dosing and avoidance of repeated supratherapeutic exposure is prudent; in acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis, acetaminophen is generally avoided outside of carefully managed contexts [^111Wzope] [^113whBEv] [^114sk8CU] [^114A11bm].

> I should confirm practical dosing tactics. Use the lowest effective dose, space doses at least 4–6 hours apart, and rigorously count all acetaminophen sources, including prescription combination products and OTC cold medications. In cirrhosis, some clinicians prefer scheduled lower doses rather than PRN to avoid inadvertent stacking, and they monitor liver enzymes periodically when therapy is prolonged or doses approach the upper end of the reduced range [^1159vpjH] [^116urmcs].

> Let me reconsider the overall recommendation to ensure internal consistency. For patients with hepatic impairment, acetaminophen should be used cautiously with dose reduction and close monitoring. Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication. In mild to moderate impairment, a pragmatic approach is to limit total daily acetaminophen to 2,000–3,000 mg, avoid exceeding 3,000 mg/day in most cases, and never exceed 4,000 mg/day from all sources. This balances analgesic benefit against hepatotoxic risk while acknowledging that the strongest evidence base supports avoidance in severe disease and cautious, individualized use in mild to moderate disease [^114A11bm] [^116tuJdq] [^111Wzope].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety counseling is explicit. Educate patients to read labels for hidden acetaminophen, avoid alcohol, and report jaundice, dark urine, or right upper quadrant pain promptly. In patients with chronic liver disease starting a new potentially hepatotoxic agent, it is reasonable to check liver biochemistries at 4–6 week intervals initially, and to stop the drug if enzymes rise rapidly or dysfunction emerges, consistent with DILI guidance in chronic liver disease [^116urmcs] [^114KiCUz].

In hepatic impairment, **acetaminophen is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment** (Child-Pugh C) [^114A11bm] and should be used with caution in mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B) [^1127GhsU] with a reduced total daily dose of 2,000–3,000 mg [^111Wzope] and close monitoring of liver function. The standard 4,000 mg/day maximum is not appropriate in hepatic impairment due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity [^1127GhsU]. Avoid alcohol and other hepatotoxic drugs, and monitor ALT, AST, and INR if therapy is continued beyond a few days.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and metabolism in hepatic impairment

Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction converted by CYP450 to NAPQI, a hepatotoxic intermediate [^11796m7N]. In hepatic impairment, **reduced hepatic clearance** increases exposure and hepatotoxic risk, especially with repeated dosing or high doses [^113QTqJB].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)**: Contraindicated due to high risk of hepatotoxicity and acute liver failure [^114A11bm] [^116ozWAs].
- **Mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B)**: Use with caution and reduce total daily dose to 2,000–3,000 mg [^111Wzope]; monitor liver function tests if therapy continues beyond a few days [^116urmcs].
- **General recommendation**: Avoid exceeding 3,000 mg/day in hepatic impairment and never exceed 4,000 mg/day from all sources [^notfound].

---

## Dose adjustment recommendations

| **Degree of hepatic impairment** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Mild (Child-Pugh A) | 2,000–3,000 mg/day with caution [^notfound] |
| Moderate (Child-Pugh B) | 2,000–3,000 mg/day with close monitoring [^notfound] |
| Severe (Child-Pugh C) | Contraindicated [^114A11bm] |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Liver function tests**: Monitor ALT, AST, and INR if therapy continues beyond a few days [^116urmcs].
- **Alcohol use**: Avoid alcohol to reduce hepatotoxic risk [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid other hepatotoxic drugs and CYP inducers/inhibitors that alter acetaminophen metabolism [^notfound].

---

## Alternative analgesic strategies

When acetaminophen is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider **non-pharmacologic measures** and use the lowest effective doses of alternative agents with caution. NSAIDs are generally avoided in cirrhosis due to bleeding and renal risks; if needed, use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely. Opioids may be used cautiously in selected patients, with dose adjustments and close monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression [^115211Cb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Contraindicated [^114A11bm].
- **Mild to moderate hepatic impairment**: 2,000–3,000 mg/day with caution and monitoring [^notfound].
- **General principle**: Use the lowest effective dose, avoid alcohol, and monitor liver function with continued use [^113bQRHE].

---

Acetaminophen requires **careful dose adjustment in hepatic impairment** [^1127GhsU]: avoid use in severe disease and limit to 2,000–3,000 mg/day with monitoring in mild to moderate impairment [^notfound].

Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause for calls to Poison Control Centers (> 100,000/year) and accounts for more than 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and an estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure each year. Data from the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry of more than 700 patients with acute liver failure across the United States implicates acetaminophen poisoning in nearly 50% of all acute liver failure in this country. Available in many single or combination products, acetaminophen produces more than 1 billion US dollars in annual sales for Tylenol products alone. It is heavily marketed for its safety compared to nonsteroidal analgesics. By enabling self-diagnosis and treatment of minor aches and pains, its benefits are said by the Food and Drug Administration to outweigh its risks. It still must be asked: Is this amount of injury and death really acceptable for an over-the-counter pain reliever?

Liver failure

Deciding analgesic therapy for patients with hepatic impairment can be a challenge, since most analgesics undergo hepatic metabolism. Cirrhosis is the most prevalent manifestation of liver disease, and it may be caused due to excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis infection or drug-induced toxicity. Since liver is the main site of metabolism for paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids such as morphine, its dysfunction may lead to increased blood levels of these drugs, particularly those that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. On the contrary, changes in CYP enzymes may result in decreased efficacy of codeine and tramadol, which undergo biotransformation to active metabolites. Thus, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile of analgesics may help in deciding the appropriate pharmacotherapy for patients with liver dysfunction. For instance, although paracetamol undergoes metabolic conversion to a hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, clinically significant toxicity is observed only at large doses, and small doses of this drug may appear to be safe in such patients. Dose adjustment should be considered while administering NSAIDs and opioids to patients with hepatic impairment.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations are presented in the Supplementary materials section.

### Developing consumer-centered, nonprescription drug labeling a study in acetaminophen [^111uj7P6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the U.S., acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute liver failure, and misuse contributes to more than 30,000 hospitalizations annually. Half to two thirds of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional, suggesting the root cause is likely poor understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dosage.

Purpose

Elicit subject feedback about active ingredient and dosing information on over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and elicit feedback on proposed plain-language text and icons.

Methods

Six focus groups, preceded by individual interviews, were conducted in April 2010 among 45 adults in two cities from two clinics and an adult basic education center. The individual interviews evaluated knowledge of OTC pain relievers, attention to product label information and literacy level while the group discussion elicited preference for label messages and icons. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2010.

Results

Forty-four percent read at or below the 6th-grade level. Individual interviews revealed that < 50% of participants routinely examine product label information. Only 31% know acetaminophen is in Tylenol®. The groups achieved consensus on a preferred icon for acetaminophen, desired explicit statement of potential liver damage in the warning against simultaneous use of acetaminophen products, and indicated preference for an icon and wording for maximum dose.

Conclusions

With the high prevalence of OTC use, a consumer-centered approach to developing icons and messages to promote awareness and safe use of acetaminophen could benefit consumers.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) [^113AG3zx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

In patients with pre-existing mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), ubrogepant exposure was increased by 7%, 50%, and 115%, respectively. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment for UBRELVY is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [s ee Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The renal route of elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of ubrogepant [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15–29 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid use of UBRELVY in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 15 mL/min).

### Acetaminophen [^113bQRHE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;
the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;
infusion pumps are properly programmed; and
the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue acetaminophen immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use acetaminophen in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

### Acetaminophen [^1159vpjH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 1,000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 1,000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4,000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Oxycodone and acetaminophen) [^116Zrixy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.

Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Renal Impairment

In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

Because oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, its clearance may decrease in patients with renal impairment. Initiate therapy with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Recommended methods of drug dosing adjustment for patients with renal impairment [^114Axnzd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Since 2020, there have been changes in Food and Drug Administration guidance and in recommendations by national organizations with a focus on kidney diseases pertaining to the choice of equations used to estimate creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. This includes a recommendation by the National Kidney Foundation to avoid the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment. This commentary provides an overview of recent recommendations concerning kidney function assessment that have important implications for drug dosing in patients with renal impairment and provides suggestions for implementing these recommendations.

Medication and immunosuppression management in pediatric HCV — In children with HCV-related advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, medications known to accelerate hepatic fibrosis (e.g., methotrexate) should be avoided, if possible. Although corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants may enhance HCV replication, they are not contraindicated in children with HCV infection, and chronic HCV infection should not delay bone marrow transplantation despite underlying liver disease being a risk factor for hepatic veno-occlusive disease. No dosage adjustments are necessary for commonly prescribed medications such as antimicrobial, antiepileptic, and cardiovascular agents. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin should be avoided, if possible, for patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices due to gastrointestinal bleeding and nephrotoxicity risks, and acetaminophen is a safe and effective analgesic for children and adolescents with chronic HCV infection when dosed per packaging recommendations.

### What is the most appropriate dose of-acetylcysteine after massive acetaminophen overdose? [^111D2esu]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

While the traditional intravenous N -acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing regimen works well for the vast majority of acetaminophen overdoses, there may be cases of massive overdose where additional NAC may be necessary. Recent evidence suggests that patients with acetaminophen concentrations above the "300-line" develop hepatotoxicity at a higher rate than those below the 300-line, suggesting that an increase of dose may be beneficial at this cut-off. Additional clinical data suggest a further increase in doses at the 450-line and 600-lines. I propose a strategy for step-wise increases in NAC dosing in response to high acetaminophen concentrations at the 300-, 450-, and 600-lines after acute massive acetaminophen overdoses.

Postvaginal delivery pain — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen should be administered on a set schedule for analgesia after vaginal delivery with OUD (Class I, Level A). Evidence notes no studies dedicated to NSAIDs or acetaminophen after vaginal delivery with OUD, but scheduled acetaminophen administration in hospital is warranted for patients with OUD, treated or untreated, and NSAIDs are recommended on a set schedule to minimize additional opioid needs; dose adjustments or caution may be required in patients with comorbid liver disease and impaired hepatic function (Class IIa, Level C-EO), and the utility of acetaminophen-opioid combination medications is uncertain with potential for toxic acetaminophen levels if a mono product is also consumed or if large doses are used (Class IIa, Level C-EO).

### Use of opioids in patients with cancer with hepatic impairment-a systematic review [^112eMXUT]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Purpose

Opioids are recommended for moderate-to-severe cancer pain; however, in patients with cancer, impaired hepatic function can affect opioid metabolism. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the use of opioids in patients with cancer with hepatic impairment.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted and the following databases searched: AMED (-2021), MEDLINE (-2021), EMBASECLASSIC + EMBASE (-2021) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (-2021). Eligible studies met the following criteria: patients with cancer-related pain, taking an opioid (as defined by the WHO Guidelines for the pharmacological and radiotherapeutic management of cancer pain in adults and adolescents); > 18 years of age; patients with hepatic impairment defined using recognised or study-defined definitions; clinical outcome hepatic impairment related; and primary studies. All eligible studies were appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.

Results

Three studies (n = 95) were eligible but heterogeneity meant meta-analysis was not possible. Each individual study focused on only one each of oxycodone ± hydrocotarnine, oxycodone/naloxone and morphine. No recommendations could be formulated on the preferred opioid in patients with hepatic impairment.

Conclusions

Morphine is the preferred opioid in hepatic impairment owing to clinical experience and pharmacokinetics. This review, however, found little clinical evidence to support this. Dose adjustments of morphine and the oxycodone formulations reviewed remain necessary in the absence of quality evidence. Overall, the quality of existing evidence on opioid treatments in cancer pain and hepatic impairment is low and there remains a need for high-quality clinical studies examining this.

### Ofirmev (acetaminophen) [^114mx156]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

2.1 General Dosing Information

OFIRMEV may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and OFIRMEV dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1–3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 1000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.

Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen oral solution and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

### Dose recommendations for anticancer drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [^113AUtBd]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Renal or hepatic impairment is a common comorbidity for patients with cancer either because of the disease itself, toxicity of previous anticancer treatments, or because of other factors affecting organ function, such as increased age. Because renal and hepatic function are among the main determinants of drug exposure, the pharmacokinetic profile might be altered for patients with cancer who have renal or hepatic impairment, necessitating dose adjustments. Most anticancer drugs are dosed near their maximum tolerated dose and are characterised by a narrow therapeutic index. Consequently, selecting an adequate dose for patients who have either hepatic or renal impairment, or both, is challenging and definitive recommendations on dose adjustments are scarce. In this Review, we discuss the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs. To guide clinicians in selecting appropriate dose adjustments, information from available drug labels and from the published literature were combined to provide a practical set of recommendations for dose adjustments of 160 anticancer drugs for patients with hepatic and renal impairment.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^115211Cb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid use in renal or hepatic impairment advises that for patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid, clinicians may rotate to methadone, if not contraindicated, as this agent is excreted fecally. Opioids primarily eliminated in urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, should be carefully titrated and frequently monitored for risk or accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol should be avoided in this population, unless there are no alternatives; Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Strong. For patients with renal or hepatic impairment who receive opioids, clinicians should perform more frequent clinical observation and opioid dose adjustment; Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Strong.

### Tramadol acetaminophen [^112WLZwy]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Special Populations

Renal

The pharmacokinetics of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol alone, excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. Adjustment of dosing regimen in this patient population is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone.

Hepatic

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Since tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Geriatric

A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from a clinical trial in patients with chronic pain treated with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, which included 55 patients between 65 and 75 years of age and 19 patients over 75 years of age, showed no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and acetaminophen in elderly patients with normal renal and hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Gender

Tramadol clearance was 20% higher in female subjects compared to males on four phase I studies of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in 50 male and 34 female healthy subjects. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown.

Pediatric

The pharmacokinetics of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 16 years of age.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^1174Ri8s]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

Methods

A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

Results

1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66–90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

### Treatment of pain in cirrhosis: advice to caregivers of those with rock livers [^113QTqJB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Ultracet) [^11796m7N]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Elimination

Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and M1 are approximately 5–6 and 7 hours, respectively, after administration of ULTRACET®. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased to 7–9 hours upon multiple dosing of ULTRACET®.

The half-life of acetaminophen is about 2 to 3 hours in adults. It is somewhat shorter in children and somewhat longer in neonates and in cirrhotic patients. Acetaminophen is eliminated from the body primarily by formation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in a dose-dependent manner. Less than 9% of acetaminophen is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Special Populations

Renal

The pharmacokinetics of ULTRACET®in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol alone, excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. Adjustment of dosing regimen in this patient population is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Gender

Tramadol clearance was 20% higher in female subjects compared to males on four phase I studies of ULTRACET®in 50 male and 34 female healthy subjects. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown.

Pediatric

The pharmacokinetics of ULTRACET®tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients below 16 years of age.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Acute Pain

The safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen for the treatment of acute pain in pediatric patients ages 2 years and older is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of acetaminophen in adults and safety and pharmacokinetic data from adult and 483 pediatric patients across all age groups [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

The effectiveness of acetaminophen for the treatment of acute pain in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age has not been established.

In patients younger than 2 years, efficacy was not demonstrated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 198 pediatric patients younger than 2 years. Pediatric patients less than 2 years of age, including neonates from 28 to 40 weeks gestational age at birth, were randomized to receive opioid plus acetaminophen or opioid plus placebo. No difference in analgesic effect of intravenous acetaminophen, measured by assessment of reduced need for additional opioid treatment for pain control was observed.

 Treatment of Fever

The safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen for the treatment of fever in pediatric patients, including premature neonates born at ≥ 32 weeks gestational age is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies of acetaminophen in adults, clinical studies in 244 pediatric patients 2 years and older, and safety and pharmacokinetic data from 239 patients younger than 2 years including neonates ≥ 32 weeks gestational age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of acetaminophen, 15% were age 65 and over, while 5% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Acetaminophen is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. A reduced total daily dose of acetaminophen may be warranted.

8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^115KAVB8]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatic and renal impairment

Additional considerations for opioid rotation include the effects of hepatic and renal impairment on opioid dosing recommendations (Table 2). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends assessment of hepatic function based on Child-Pugh ratings (mild, moderate, severe)and defines moderate and severe renal impairment as a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/minute and < 30 mL/minute, respectively. Many opioid drugs undergo hepatic phase I metabolism mediated by the CYP mono-oxygenases (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2D6), enzymes that produce both active and inactive metabolites that vary among commonly used opioid agents (Table 3). Moreover, metabolism of opioids by CYP3A4 produces major metabolites of certain opioids that exhibit > 30-fold higher (eg, hydrocodone produces norhydrocodone) and lower (eg, buprenorphine produces norbuprenorphine) affinity for the μ-opioid receptor. Thus, for patients with hepatic or renal impairment undergoing pain management with opioid A, clinicians may consider the following guidance: 1) dose adjustments are required or recommended with a number of opioids, including morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone in patients with renal impairment;,2) patients with renal impairment may be rotated to fentanyl or buprenorphine, which are less affected by renal impairment;,3) tapentadol, tramadol, and methadone should be administered with great caution in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment;, and 4) consider rotation to fentanyl in patients with hepatic impairment, which appear not to alter levels of this opioid.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hepatic Injury

Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products.

Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.3 Risk of Medication Errors

Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering OFIRMEV (acetaminophen) Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that:

the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused;

the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg;

infusion pumps are properly programmed; and

the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue OFIRMEV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use OFIRMEV in patients with acetaminophen allergy.

### Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine dose and duration: past, present and future [^113pTZsz]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Acetylcysteine has been utilized successfully in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose since the 1970s. Although prospective trials as to efficacy and safety of acetylcysteine were conducted, there were no randomized controlled trials. This commentary addresses the reasons for this, and the background to choice of dose of acetylcysteine utilized in the oral and IV dosing regimens. Nomograms to predict possible hepatotoxicity based upon time of ingestion of acetaminophen were developed from a relatively arbitrary definition of toxicity as an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (ALT/AST) greater than 1000 IU/L. While these have proved generally useful, patients still continue to develop hepatic damage after acetaminophen overdose, particularly if they present late after ingestion. The optimum management of these patients remains unclear, and one area of uncertainty is the dose and duration of acetylcysteine in various circumstances. This article discusses the issues that need to be elucidated to better target changes in acetylcysteine dose. The potential for measurements of other markers to improve treatment selection is the subject of further research.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.

### Unexpected paracetamol (acetaminophen) hepatotoxicity at standard dosage in two older patients: time to rethink 1 g four times daily? [^113qDf6h]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

We present two cases of acute hepatotoxicity associated with elevated paracetamol (acetaminophen) levels in older patients. Both patients were receiving a standard European dose of oral paracetamol (2 × 500 mg QDS) with no risk factors for slowed metabolism (weight < 50 kg, interacting medications, hepatic enzyme inducers, history of liver disease). Significantly, both patients had recently had a dose escalation from 'as needed' dosing to 4 g daily, and the medication was being administered by nursing staff. Our experience shows that even when prescribed appropriately at the usual therapeutic dosage, paracetamol can be hepatotoxic.

### Somapacitan-beco (Sogroya) [^116gk5RJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Adult patients: No dose adjustment of SOGROYA is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Higher somapacitan-beco exposure was observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, initiate SOGROYA with a dose of 1 mg once weekly and use smaller increments when increasing the dose. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg once weekly. Somapacitan-beco was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, use of SOGROYA is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pediatric patients: Based on the hepatic impairment study in adults, no dose adjustment of SOGROYA is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Higher systemic exposure of SOGROYA is expected in pediatric patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment; therefore, SOGROYA is not recommended in these pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.

Figure 2
HI study design by PK linearity. Study design refers to PK evaluation portion of the study. A total of 80 compounds were included (two studies were conducted for each of gefitinib and sorafenib). HI, hepatic impairment; PK, pharmacokinetic.

A total of 71 dedicated HI studies with available information on sample size were identified. The median number of participants included in these dedicated HI studies was 9 (range: 4–25), 8 (range 4–39), 8 (3–20), and 7 (1–32) for normal, mild, moderate, and severe HI subgroups, respectively (Table 2). The relationship between observed exposure changes from the dedicated studies and magnitude of the proposed dose reduction is presented in Figure 3. The line of unity in Figure 3 depicted the dose adjustment required to produce equivalent exposures in patients with different HI degrees to those with normal hepatic function. For example, a twofold area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) increase for a drug in patients with moderate HI may necessitate a 50% dose reduction from the standard dose in this population. Dose adjustments were in general inversely proportional to observed changes in PK around the line of unity. Most deviations may be attributed to the specific therapeutic window for each compound (e.g. exposure–safety and efficacy relationships) and/or limitations or restrictions in dosage form (Figure 3). However, there were cases where dose adjustment deviates significantly from the line of unity (i.e. large underadjustment or overadjustment).

The dashed line depicts the recommended dose adjustment required to produce equivalent exposures in patients with normal hepatic function. For example, a twofold increase in PK exposure would lead to 50% dose reduction. The vertical dotted line marks the AUC ratio of 1 which indicates similar exposure between participants with HI and participants with normal hepatic function. Gefitinib and brentuximab were removed from the data presentation. Brentuximab combined HI categories into one category of impaired hepatic function. Two studies were conducted for gefitinib (one in HI due to cirrhosis and one in HI due to liver metastases), and clear guidance on dose adjustment was not provided. Dose normalized exposure differences from dose‐escalation studies were not included. AUC, area under the concentration‐time curve; HI, hepatic impairment; PK, pharmacokinetic.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^113Y7MNH]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen — dosing, patient selection, and safety: Usual dosing is 2–4 grams [g] per day and its use may still be preferred by providers for patients with more mild disease or mild-to-moderate symptoms of OA and for those at risk for NSAID-induced adverse events, including renal disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk for CVD, a history of gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers, those receiving oral anticoagulants or corticosteroids, and the elderly aged > 65 years. Although considered relatively safe at usual doses up to 4,000 mg daily, the risk for acute liver injury and liver failure is increased at doses > 4,000 mg daily. In an SR, adverse events did not differ versus placebo (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.92–1.11), but liver function test abnormalities were higher with acetaminophen (RR: 3.79, 95% CI: 1.94–7.39), with unclear clinical significance. An observational SR not included in the CPG's evidence review reported a dose-dependent statistical increase in mortality (n = 1 study), cardiovascular (CV) events (n = 4 studies), gastrointestinal (GI) events (n = 1 study), and renal events (n = 3 studies) with acetaminophen use versus no use.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — strength and quality definitions: Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and cost. Strong recommendations are those where the benefits clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action. Conditional recommendations are made when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm, for example, there may be variability in preferences and values, uncertainty about the study outcomes or quality of evidence, and higher cost or resource consumption. Quality of evidence categories are defined as follows — High: Further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Moderate: Further research may change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Low: Further research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in clinical effect and would likely change the estimate. Very low: There is very little confidence in effect estimate, and the true clinical effect is likely to be substantially different.

### Limiting acetaminophen in prescription combination opioid products… [^1162kP8D]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Each year, more than 60 000 people in the US are hospitalized with acetaminophen toxicity, with many cases due to intentional overdose. However, 40% to 58% of acute liver failure cases due to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity are unintentional, with many involving combination acetaminophen and opioid products taken over several days with therapeutic intent. 3–5 A 2005 study reported that 43% of acetaminophen-induced ALF cases involved combination acetaminophen and opioid medications.
3. Each acetaminophen overdose case was assessed for intentionality; cases without clear etiology were reviewed by the Causality Adjudication Committee's 9 liver experts. 3, 15. NIS secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and proportion of hospitalizations resulting in liver transplant.

ALFSG secondary outcomes included peak Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and MELD-sodium scores, 17, 18 21-day spontaneous survival, proportion receiving transplant within 21 days, and peak laboratory values of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, INR, and creatinine. In the NIS and across all 3 analyses, there were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality prior to and after the mandate. In the ALFSG, prior to and after the FDA mandate announcement and implementation, there were no significant differences in peak bilirubin levels, creatinine levels, INR, MELD/MELD-Na scores, or 21-day survival across all 3 analyses, and no significant differences in peak AST and ALT levels, except in analysis 1.

Liver transplant during hospitalizations with acetaminophen and opioid toxicity did not differ significantly prior to and after the mandate; however, there was a statistically significant increase in transplants for acetaminophen toxicity alone after the mandate in all 3 NIS analyses. Analyses that limited hospitalizations to cases in which acetaminophen toxicity appeared in the top 5 diagnosis codes, adjusted for seasonality, excluded hepatitis C and alcohol misuse, and analyzed pediatric cases yielded results similar to the main findings.

Tapentadol — short-acting opioid dosing and timing for adults are specified as follows: Initial oral dose is 50 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) the starting dose is 50 mg every 12 hrs; subsequent dose is 50, 75, or 100 mg every 4 to 6 hr adjusted to analgesia and tolerability; a second dose may be given 1 hr after the first dose if necessary; the max recommended dose is 700 mg on first day, 600 mg on subsequent days. Pharmacologic timing parameters are Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 4 to 6, and t½ (hr): ~4. In hepatic dysfunction, mild hepatic impairment requires no dosage adjustment, moderate hepatic impairment: start at 50 mg and give subsequent doses at least 8 hr apart (max. 3 doses in 24 hr), and severe hepatic impairment: use is not recommended. In renal dysfunction, no dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate renal impairment; tapentadol is not recommended in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min).

Tapentadol extended-release (ER) tablets — formulations, initiation, titration, and precautions include the following: Available as tablets containing 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg tapentadol for twice daily dosing. In opioid-naïve and non-tolerant patients: Initiate therapy with 50 mg twice daily; use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioid to tapentadol ER; convert current opioid to an estimated equianalgesic daily dose of tapentadol; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose. Dose change increments: May increase dose by no more than 50 mg twice daily every 3 days. Maximum daily dose: 500 mg daily. Tapentadol ER tablets must be taken whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tapentadol and can lead to overdose. Steady state is attained after the third dose (24 hr after the first twice daily multiple dose administration). Special populations: Elderly — No dosing adjustment needed, consider starting at lowest recommended dosage; patients with renal dysfunction — No dosage adjustment for mild or moderate renal impairment; not recommended in severe renal impairment; patients with hepatic dysfunction — Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Other considerations: Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol which can increase serum tapentadol concentration and cause fatal overdose, and use with or within 14 days of MAOIs is contraindicated.

### Tramadol hcl and acetaminophen [^1179hZ3L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^114sk8CU]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a safe and effective over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic and antipyretic that has been used clinically for over 50 years. It is widely considered an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with fever, as well as for a variety of conditions causing mild to moderate pain.

Acetaminophen is used by over 50 million adults in the United States each week. Reports of hepatic failure and death following the intended therapeutic use of acetaminophen by patients who consume alcohol have been published. Some practitioners recommend that the maximum dose of acetaminophen be lowered from the current dose of 4 g/day or that acetaminophen be avoided completely in alcoholic patients. As acetaminophen is used without injury by a large number of people with a history of alcohol ingestion, the apparent overall risk appears low. A systematic review of acetaminophen use in alcoholic subjects concluded that there was little credible evidence implicating therapeutic doses of acetaminophen as a cause for fulminant hepatotoxicity in alcoholics. Nevertheless, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that the labels of non-prescription analgesic drugs, including acetaminophen products, warn patients who consume more than three alcoholic drinks daily to discuss the use of acetaminophen with their doctor.

The principal determinant of acetaminophen-induced liver injury is believed to be the reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), produced primarily by CYP2E1-mediated oxidation of acetaminophen. The primary defense against the toxic actions of this metabolite is the hepatic store of reduced glutathione (GSH). Plasma GSH concentrations are thought to provide a reasonable surrogate assessment of hepatic GSH stores. Published data suggest that that the plasma GSH concentration is decreased in alcoholic subjects, particularly in those ingesting acetaminophen.

Previous research has shown that a 2-day course of acetaminophen in subjects with chronic alcoholism did not cause changes in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin or international normalized ratio (INR). It has been proposed that the 2-day course of treatment was of insufficient duration to induce hepatic injury. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine if a 3-day course of acetaminophen dose (4.0 g/day) affects the serum ALT, AST or INR, and (2) to determine if the plasma concentration of reduced glutathione is affected by this acetaminophen dosing regimen.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^116tuJdq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonopioid pharmacologic treatments — musculoskeletal pain recommendation and key evidence are as follows: "Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain (strong, high)". The remark specifies that "Studies typically used 4 g/day dosing of acetaminophen; lower dosing is recommended for patients with liver disease", and that versus traditional NSAIDs, "COX-2 NSAIDs are associated with decreased risk of gastrointestinal side effects but increased cardiovascular risk". Supporting data include a review of "more than 11 000 patients enrolled in 65 trials of NSAIDs", with "Data from this review (42% of trials considered high quality) [showing] that, compared to placebo, NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief… but at the risk of significantly more gastrointestinal and renovascular side effects", and "It is important to note that effect sizes were small". For osteoarthritis, "one medication was not superior to others", and "the chronic administration of NSAIDs is linked to gastrointestinal (eg, bleeding), renal, and other systemic side effects… and so require continual monitoring", while "Coprescribing of proton pump inhibitors or H2-antagonists reduced the risk of endoscopically detected gastroduodenal ulcers compared to placebo". For acetaminophen, "Studies with acetaminophen typically used 4 g/day", yet in the Veterans Aging Cohort "31% of 14885 patients with HIV disease received at least 1 prescription for acetaminophen of more than 2 g/day", with use common in "HIV (31%) and HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfected (32%)" patients; "Current recommendations limit the dose of acetaminophen to no more than 2 g/day in patients with liver disease".

Pre-anesthetic medication

Pre-anesthetic medication has traditionally been given to allay anxiety, but long-acting agents impair psychomotor recovery after general anesthesia. A Cochrane review on anxiolytic premedication for outpatient surgery showed that patients who received oral anxiolytics had psychomotor function impairment 4 h after surgery, reducing their ability to ambulate, eat, and drink. In selected cases, short-acting anxiolytics (such as 1–2 mg midazolam) can be given to ease regional anesthesia before general anesthesia induction. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older patient populations (aged 65 years and older) strongly advise against using benzodiazepines as they may cause cognitive impairment and increase the risk of delirium and falls in the elderly.

More recently, preoperative medication was more commonly used as perioperative multimodal analgesic adjuncts. In liver surgery, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) preoperatively is not recommended because of the risk of acute kidney injury. A meta-analysis of 281 trials (n = 24,682 participants) examining the use of gabapentinoids in major surgery showed that although there was a mild analgesic effect, there were significant problems with blurred vision and dizziness. These appeared to be dose-related but could occur with normal dosing in the elderly, so their use in liver surgery was not recommended. Acetaminophen has to be dose-adjusted if significant liver parenchyma is removed. Scopolamine patches are effective in patients with high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) but should be avoided in the elderly due to central effects.

Summary and recommendation: Long-acting anxiolytic drugs should be avoided, particularly in the elderly. Preoperative gabapentinoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended. Preoperative acetaminophen should be dose-adjusted according to extent of resection. Preoperative hyoscine patches can be used in patients with high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting but should be avoided in the elderly.

Evidence level: Moderate.

Grade of recommendation: Strong.

American College of Gastroenterology guideline methods and recommendation grading: Recommendations are evidence-based whenever possible, with consensus used when evidence is not available, and the ACG Practice Parameters Committee adopted the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system with the GRADE process conducted by 2 formally trained GRADE methodologists. The quality of evidence is graded from high to very low, with high quality indicating that further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect and that the true effect lies close to this estimate; moderate quality is associated with moderate confidence although further research could impact the estimate; low quality indicates further study is likely to have an important impact on confidence and would likely change the estimate; and very low quality indicates very little confidence and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different than the estimate. Recommendation strength is defined as strong when the benefits of therapy clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action, and conditional when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm.

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^112vjiaF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

Cautions

Pregnancy

The use of Oliceridine has not been studied in pregnant women or during lactation, hence data on birth defects, miscarriage, and breast milk transfer are lacking. Pending such data, the FDA cautions that Oliceridine crosses the placenta and may result in respiratory depression or neonatal withdrawal syndrome with prolonged intrapartum use. Thus, Oliceridine should be administered in pregnant women only if the benefits outweigh potential risks, and its use is not recommended during labor.

Renal Impairment

A Phase I study investigated the safety of a single Oliceridine 0.5mg dose in patients with end-stage renal disease versus healthy controls. Commensurate with the minimal renal clearance of Oliceridine, patients with end-stage renal disease were found to have similar pharmacokinetics and drug clearance compared to age- and sex-matched normal individuals, hence no dose adjustment is required in this patient population.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment exhibit similar peak concentrations and drug clearance compared to normal individuals, although volume of distribution and half-time are increased. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction, but reduced initial dose and titration of subsequent doses to clinical endpoints are recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15).

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^111MhsX3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Prothrombin time and international normalized ratio activity should be measured in patients with an elevated transaminase activity or clinical suspicion of liver injury. Acetylcysteine should be administered while awaiting acetaminophen concentrations if samples are drawn more than 24 hours after ingestion and the patient has signs and symptoms of toxicity. A pregnancy test result should be documented for all females of childbearing age. ALT indicates alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CMP, complete metabolic panel; ED, emergency department; and PI, post ingestion. line. 9 A line beginning at 300 μg/mL at 4 hours was derived as 50% greater than the original nomogram line to denote patients and increased risk of developing liver injury. 10 Acetylcysteine should be initiated if a serum or plasma acetaminophen blood concentration drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion falls on or above the treatment line.

If the concentration falls on or above the high-risk line, many clinicians would provide an increased dose of acetylcysteine. However, the medical literature is insufficient to allow recommendation of a specific acetylcysteine dose in this circumstance. If indicated, acetylcysteine should be initiated and the route or rate of administration adjusted if the patient develops adverse events, such as vomiting or an anaphylactoid reaction. When a 150-mg/kg loading dose is used, it should be infused over at least 1 hour. ALT indicates alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; IV, intravenous; INR, international normalized ratio; NAC, acetylcysteine; PT, prothrombin time. Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. Acetaminophen poisoning may occur as a self-harm attempt or the inadvertent consumption of repeated doses in the treatment of pain or fever.

Toxic effects of acetaminophen are characterized by hepatocellular damage, which may lead to acute liver injury, acute liver failure, or death. Consultation with a liver transplant team for possible liver transplant should be considered in patients with progressive increases in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase and coagulation abnormalities. Liver transplant team consultation should also be considered in patients with encephalopathy or multisystem failure despite acetylcysteine treatment.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — burden and dose relationship: In North America, APAP overdose is believed to result in 100,000 calls to poison control centers, 500,000 emergency room visits, and at least 500 deaths annually, and the annual number of ALF cases from APAP dwarfs that from all idiosyncratic reactions combined. APAP is a dose-related hepatotoxin with susceptibility to liver injury in doses only 2 to 3 times therapeutic dosing.
