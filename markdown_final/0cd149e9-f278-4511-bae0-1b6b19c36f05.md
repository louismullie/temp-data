## Question

Right upper quadrant pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step approach to evaluating right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the core elements of history that distinguish biliary, hepatic, and other causes. Next, I will examine the focused physical findings, especially Murphy's sign and its limitations. After that, I need to check the first-line laboratory tests and when to add extra studies. Then, I should confirm the imaging strategy and the evidence behind ultrasound-first, including conditional CT/MRI pathways. Finally, I will consider special populations and a prioritized differential with key mimics and "can't miss" diagnoses, and close with management touchpoints and disposition decisions, ensuring I continually double-check assumptions against the literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm priorities in the initial assessment: I need to ensure hemodynamic stability, screen for red flags, and define the pain chronology and character before anchoring on a single diagnosis. Hold on, I should verify that no single clinical or laboratory feature reliably rules in or out acute cholecystitis, which means I must avoid premature closure and keep a broad differential while escalating diagnostics as needed [^111pmgwj] [^112BidjC].

> Next, I should review the history systematically: onset and duration (hours vs days vs weeks), location with radiation to back or right shoulder, quality (colicky biliary-type pain vs constant), relation to meals and fatty foods, associated fever, jaundice, pruritus, nausea/vomiting, and any recent trauma or procedures. Wait, let me verify biliary colic descriptors; typical attacks last at least 15–30 minutes, can be severe, and may radiate to the back or shoulder, often responding to analgesics, which supports gallstone-related disease when present [^112ZUeFZ] [^115fGGQP].

> I need to check for systemic and extra-biliary clues: weight loss or night sweats suggest malignancy or chronic infection. Rash or arthralgias point to autoimmune or vasculitic processes. Pregnancy status alters imaging choices. Travel and exposure risks matter for parasitic disease and atypical infections. But wait, what if there is RUQ pain with fever and a positive Murphy's sign in a young person with tonsillar exudates? That could be Epstein-Barr virus with acalculous gallbladder wall edema rather than bacterial cholecystitis, so I should verify serologies before committing to antibiotics and surgery [^116ymMFA].

> Now, I will examine the physical findings with attention to Murphy's sign, RUQ tenderness, jaundice, and peritoneal signs. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said Murphy's sign has a high positive likelihood ratio and thus can confirm cholecystitis; hold on, I should verify that. The JAMA Rational Clinical Examination review notes that no single sign reliably rules in or out acute cholecystitis, with Murphy's sign having only a modest positive LR and RUQ tenderness a modest negative LR, so clinical gestalt plus imaging remains essential rather than relying on a single maneuver [^111pmgwj].

> I will now order core laboratory tests and selectively add extras based on pretest probability: CBC, CRP, liver panel with AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and total/direct bilirubin. Urinalysis. Consider lipase if pancreatitis is a concern. In women of reproductive age, obtain a pregnancy test. If jaundice is present or cholangitis suspected, add INR and consider blood cultures. If hepatitis is suspected, include viral hepatitis serologies. If autoimmune liver disease is on the table, add ANA and related antibodies. Let me reconsider the yield: cholestatic patterns and direct hyperbilirubinemia steer me toward biliary obstruction or cholangitis, while marked transaminase elevations push me toward hepatitis or ischemia, and I should not anchor on LFTs alone without correlating clinically [^112BidjC].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy, and I need to ensure I state this correctly: ultrasound is the first-line modality for RUQ pain because it is fast, widely available, lacks ionizing radiation, and can detect stones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy's sign, ductal dilation, and many alternative diagnoses. Wait, I should double-check the strength of evidence: ACR Appropriateness Criteria and multiple studies support ultrasound first, with conditional CT or MRI based on findings and patient factors, including special handling in pregnancy [^111s74rW] [^111dW4BF] [^111aRGpj].

> I will now examine the imaging cascade: if ultrasound is positive for acute cholecystitis, I should proceed to surgical consultation. If it is indeterminate, contrast-enhanced CT can identify complications and alternative etiologies. If ultrasound is negative but suspicion remains high, HIDA cholescintigraphy can increase diagnostic certainty for acalculous cholecystitis. In pregnancy, MRI or MRCP is preferred over CT when ultrasound is non-diagnostic. Hold on, I should verify diagnostic yield tradeoffs: a conditional strategy of ultrasound followed by CT in negative/inconclusive cases achieves high sensitivity for urgent conditions while minimizing unnecessary CT use, balancing radiation and cost considerations [^111s74rW] [^112Yc9Ju] [^111dW4BF].

> Let me consider key differentials and mimics I must not miss. Biliary etiologies predominate but are not exclusive: gallstone disease, acute and acalculous cholecystitis, cholangitis, and Mirizzi syndrome remain high-yield considerations, but hepatitis, hepatic abscess, portal vein thrombosis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, adrenal or renal pathology, and even thoracic causes like pneumonia or pleural effusion can present as RUQ pain. I should confirm that ultrasound can often identify non-biliary causes during the same study, reducing missed diagnoses and unnecessary CTs [^111s74rW] [^112jNZ25].

> Special populations require tailored pathways. In pregnancy, I should avoid ionizing radiation when possible and favor ultrasound followed by MRI/MRCP if needed, while still prioritizing maternal stabilization and surgical consultation if acalculous cholecystitis or hepatic complications like HELLP-associated rupture are suspected. In older adults, I need a lower threshold for CT given atypical presentations and higher prevalence of vascular or malignant disease. In post-cholecystectomy patients, I should remember postcholecystectomy syndrome, retained stones, biliary dyskinesia, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Let me verify each of these pivots against guideline-based recommendations before committing to a pathway [^111dW4BF] [^112BidjC] [^115nbJYv].

> Management touchpoints depend on the working diagnosis. If acute cholecystitis is diagnosed, early cholecystectomy is preferred when feasible. If the patient is unstable or high risk, temporizing measures such as antibiotics and cholecystostomy are appropriate. For cholangitis, I should ensure early IV antibiotics and biliary decompression, typically via ERCP. For viral hepatitis or EBV-related cholecystitis mimics, I should stop unnecessary antibiotics and provide supportive care. I need to ensure disposition aligns with severity, likelihood of decompensation, and need for intervention, integrating surgery and GI consultation early when indicated [^116ymMFA].

> In summary, I should double-check that my algorithm remains anchored to ultrasound-first imaging after a focused history and exam, with conditional CT/MRI or HIDA based on results and patient context, and with explicit attention to mimics and special populations. The absence of a single pathognomonic sign or test for cholecystitis means I must maintain diagnostic humility, verify discordant features, and escalate appropriately while avoiding unnecessary radiation and delays in definitive care [^111s74rW] [^111pmgwj] [^112BidjC].

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is most often due to **biliary disease** (gallstones, cholecystitis, cholangitis) [^111s74rW] or **hepatic disease** (hepatitis, abscess, neoplasm) [^114TCGGR], but it can also reflect peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or renal colic [^111s74rW] [^112jNZ25]. Begin with a focused history (onset, character, radiation, associated symptoms) and exam (Murphy's sign, jaundice, hepatomegaly) [^111pmgwj], then order **CBC, LFTs, lipase, and urinalysis** [^112BidjC]. Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** for suspected biliary disease [^111s74rW]; if inconclusive or complications are suspected, obtain contrast-enhanced CT or MRI/MRCP [^111dW4BF] [^112jNZ25]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics and urgent cholecystectomy for cholecystitis, ERCP for cholangitis, and supportive care for hepatitis [^1112KYqH]. Always reassess for red flags (fever, jaundice, hypotension, severe pain) and escalate care promptly [^114LvVvZ] [^113T9h7b].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for RUQ pain is broad, spanning gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, renal, and thoracic causes [^112jNZ25]:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Less common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Hepatobiliary | - Gallstones <br/> - Acute cholecystitis <br/> - Cholangitis <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Liver abscess <br/> - Hepatic neoplasm | - Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome <br/> - Hydatid cyst <br/> - Hemangioma <br/> - Adenoma <br/> - Focal nodular hyperplasia |
| Gastrointestinal | - Peptic ulcer disease <br/> - Pancreatitis <br/> - Duodenal ulcer <br/> - Gastritis | - Duodenal ulcer perforation <br/> - Small bowel obstruction <br/> - Colon cancer <br/> - Intussusception |
| Renal | - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Renal colic | - Renal abscess <br/> - Polycystic kidney disease |
| Thoracic | - Pneumonia <br/> - Pleurisy <br/> - Pulmonary embolism | - Empyema <br/> - Lung cancer |
| Musculoskeletal | - Rib fracture <br/> - Intercostal neuralgia <br/> - Muscle strain | - Myofascial pain syndrome <br/> - Costochondritis |

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Obtain a **focused history** to characterize the pain and identify risk factors:

- **Onset and duration**: Sudden onset suggests biliary colic or renal colic; gradual onset suggests hepatitis or malignancy [^notfound].
- **Character**: Colicky pain suggests biliary or renal colic; constant pain suggests hepatitis or pancreatitis [^notfound].
- **Radiation**: Radiation to the back or shoulder suggests biliary disease [^115fGGQP].
- **Associated symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, fever, jaundice, dark urine, clay-colored stools, weight loss, dyspnea, cough [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Alcohol use, recent travel, pregnancy, medication use, sexual history, trauma, prior surgeries [^notfound].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **targeted examination**:

- **Vital signs**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension [^114LvVvZ].
- **Abdominal examination**: Murphy's sign (suggests cholecystitis), tenderness, guarding, rebound, hepatomegaly, jaundice [^111pmgwj].
- **Extra-abdominal findings**: Pleural rub, respiratory distress, costovertebral angle tenderness [^114TeDKQ].

---

## Diagnostic testing

### Laboratory tests

Order the following **initial laboratory tests**:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Leukocytosis suggests infection or inflammation [^1111Jzaz].
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Elevated AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin suggest hepatobiliary disease [^115nbJYv].
- **Lipase/amylase**: Elevated in pancreatitis [^116rPNVs].
- **Urinalysis**: Hematuria suggests renal colic; proteinuria suggests renal disease [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy test**: Rule out pregnancy-related complications [^112BidjC].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^117DxLpY]:

- **Ultrasound**: First-line for suspected biliary disease (gallstones, cholecystitis, cholangitis) [^113NwiwF].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Indicated for suspected complications, malignancy, or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^111dW4BF].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful for detailed biliary and hepatic evaluation, especially in pregnancy [^111dW4BF].
- **Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Diagnostic and therapeutic for choledocholithiasis and cholangitis [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Gallstones/cholecystitis**: Antibiotics, analgesia, and cholecystectomy [^116ymMFA].
- **Cholangitis**: Urgent biliary drainage (ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography) and antibiotics [^notfound].
- **Hepatitis**: Supportive care, antiviral therapy if indicated [^1112KYqH].
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Proton pump inhibitors, Helicobacter pylori eradication [^notfound].
- **Pancreatitis**: Supportive care, analgesia, fluid resuscitation [^notfound].
- **Renal colic**: Analgesia, hydration, urology referral [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms and signs

Recognize **red flags** that require immediate escalation:

- **Severe pain with hemodynamic instability**: Suspect ruptured viscus, massive hemorrhage, or sepsis [^notfound].
- **Fever with jaundice**: Suspect cholangitis or severe hepatitis [^1174xBBo].
- **Severe pain with peritoneal signs**: Suspect perforated ulcer or ruptured abscess [^notfound].
- **Sudden severe pain in pregnancy**: Suspect HELLP syndrome, hepatic rupture, or placental abruption [^115i7bvN].

---

Right upper quadrant pain has a broad differential, but a **structured approach** — history, exam, targeted labs, and imaging — enables accurate diagnosis and timely management. Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** for suspected biliary disease, with CT or MRI reserved for complex or inconclusive cases [^111dW4BF]. Always reassess for red flags and escalate care promptly when indicated [^116AnYmS].

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^111dW4BF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in patients with acute cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Colicky epigastric and right upper quadrant pain… [^1173d1E8]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

A woman in her 50s presented to our emergency department with a 3-hour history of sudden epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. She did not report any previous abdominal surgery. The colicky pain did not migrate during that period and occurred in paroxysms at 9- to 10-minute intervals. The patient was afebrile and had no nausea or vomiting. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia and moderate abdominal distension without signs of peritonism; the bowel sounds were hyperactive. Careful examination ruled out incarcerated hernias in the groin, femoral triangle, and obturator foramen. Blood analysis results showed mild leukocytosis without elevation of the C-reactive protein level. Serum electrolyte levels were within the normal range. Computed tomography of the abdomen was conducted.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Multi-detector computed tomography of acute abdomen [^116w2ht4]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common causes for referrals to the emergency department. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain characterising the "acute abdomen" requires rapid and accurate identification of a potentially life-threatening abdominal pathology to provide a timely referral to the appropriate physician. While the physical examination and laboratory investigations are often non-specific, computed tomography (CT) has evolved as the first-line imaging modality in patients with an acute abdomen. Because the new multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner generations provide increased speed, greater volume coverage and thinner slices, the acceptance of CT for abdominal imaging has increased rapidly. The goal of this article is to discuss the role of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of acute abdominal pain.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^116Fkn8k]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Repeat computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) frequency and radiation exposure show heterogeneity. Studies examined very short intervals "0–72 h" "within 7 days" or "within 1 month of the index CTAP". Longer-duration cohorts spanned "up to 1 year" and "up to 6 years" and reported "three or more CTAPs within 1 year in 6.3% of patients" and "an average of 2.7 CTAPs per patient (range 2–10)". Radiation findings include a cohort "aged 18 to 45 years" where "20% underwent more than one CTAP over a 6-year period", with "The mean cumulative effective radiation dose was 70.1 mSv (range 14–437 mSv)" and "A total of 41% of patients with repeat CTAP had a cumulative dose > 50 mSv", while "the median radiation exposure from a CTAP with IV contrast was 16 mSv". Diagnostic yield varied, as "Diagnostic yield of repeat CTAP was heterogeneous".

Context

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources.

Objective

To determine if aspects of the history and physical examination or basic laboratory testing clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

Data Sources

Electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 indexed in MEDLINE. We also hand-searched Index Medicus for 1950–1965, and scanned references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks of physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology. To identify relevant articles appearing since the comprehensive search, we repeated the MEDLINE search in July 2002.

Study Selection

Included studies evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group found not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound, or clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis and no evidence for an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were included. Seventeen of 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

No clinical or laboratory finding had a sufficiently high positive likelihood ratio (LR) or low negative LR to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Possible exceptions were the Murphy sign (positive LR, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1), though the 95% CIs for both included 1.0. Available data on diagnostic confirmation rates at laparotomy and test characteristics of relevant radiological investigations suggest that the diagnostic impression of acute cholecystitis has a positive LR of 25 to 30. Unfortunately, the available literature does not identify the specific combinations of clinical and laboratory findings that presumably account for this diagnostic success.

Conclusions

No single clinical finding or laboratory test carries sufficient weight to establish or exclude cholecystitis without further testing (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound). Combinations of certain symptoms, signs, and laboratory results likely have more useful LRs, and presumably inform the diagnostic impressions of experienced clinicians. Pending further research characterizing the pretest probabilities associated with different clinical presentations, the evaluation of patients with abdominal pain suggestive of cholecystitis will continue to rely heavily on the clinical gestalt and diagnostic imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute left upper quadrant pain [^115qtMc8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department and outpatient setting. Across all sites, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the least common location for abdominal pain with reportedly the lowest physical examination interrater agreement. The limited sensitivity of physical examination, combined with an uncommon and nonspecific clinical presentation, make assessment of LUQ pain challenging. Acute LUQ pain may arise directly from the spleen or infections in the LUQ, or represent referred pain from other organs such as stomach, bowels, pancreas, or kidney. This document aims to address acute pain with suspected splenomegaly, with fever, and not otherwise specified. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is usually appropriate for detection of a broad range of pathologies. In patients with suspected splenomegaly, ultrasound abdomen is also usually an appropriate alternate for initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Computerized tomography of the acute left upper quadrant pain [^11767pVE]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen in the emergent setting of left upper quadrant pain. One hundred patients (average age: 45, range: 19–93 years, female: 57%, male: 43%) who presented to the emergency department (ED) and underwent CT scanning of abdomen with the given indication of left upper quadrant pain were included in this study. The results from CT examinations were compared to final diagnoses determined by either ED physician or clinician on a follow-up visit. Sensitivity of CT was 69% (95%CI: 52–83%) for 39 patients who eventually were diagnosed with an acute abdominal abnormality. Twenty-seven patients had an acute abnormal finding on abdominal CT that represented the cause of the patient's pain (positive predictive value of 100%, 95%CI: 87–100%). Of the remaining 73 patients with negative CT report, 12 were diagnosed clinically (either in the ED or on follow-up visit to specialist) with a pathology that was undetectable on the CT imaging (negative predictive value of 83%, 95%CI: 73–91%). None of the remaining 61 patients with negative CT were found to have pathology by clinical evaluation (specificity of 100%, 95%CI: 94–100%). CT is a useful examination for patients with acute left upper quadrant pain in the emergency department setting with moderate sensitivity and excellent specificity.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### A 26-year-old woman with postpartum abdominal pain [^112UQWYi]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 26-year-old woman who developed acute hepatocellular liver injury following a cesarean delivery for fetal distress. Using targeted questions, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is iteratively refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Other vascular diseases

Acute torsion of the FL resulting in focal fat infarction is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain. Torsion of the FL has a similar pathological process to other well-known focal fat infarctions in the abdomen, such as omental infarction or epiploic appendagitis. Patients usually present with right upper quadrant pain. Blood tests can show mild elevation of inflammatory markers. As the differential diagnosis of right upper quadrant pain is broad, imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis. In the US, the increased fat echogenicity in the right upper quadrant or non-compressible heterogeneous hyperechoic mass may be seen, but it is non-specific, as many other inflammatory processes may cause it. On the next step, CT is preferable owing to the fast acquisition time in emergency patients. CT can show a well-circumscribed mass-like area in the fissure of the FL with fat attenuation and associated inflammatory changes in the adjacent fat planes (Fig. 12).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain – suspected appendicitis [^113454rA]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnostic imaging of patients presenting with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis may be organized according to age and gender and to the presence or absence of "classic" signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis. Among adult patients presenting with clinical signs of acute appendicitis, the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of ultrasound, with improved performance when CT is performed with intravenous contrast. The use of rectal contrast has been associated with decreased time in the emergency department. Computed tomography has also been shown to reduce cost and negative appendectomy rates. Both CT and ultrasound are also effective in the identification of causes of right lower quadrant pain unrelated to appendicitis. Among pediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression ultrasound can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation. Performing MRI after inconclusive ultrasound in pregnant patients has been associated with sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 86% and 97% to 99%, respectively. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The colon cutoff sign: an unusual indicator of urologic disease [^1118MDuc]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old obese, alcoholic woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of gradual abdominal pain. An abdominal radiograph showed termination of colonic gas at the splenic flexure. Initial laboratory examinations are unremarkable. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed left ureteral calculi with rupture and extravasation of contrast media over the upper-third ureter. To our knowledge, the colon cutoff sign is rarely been related to ureteral rupture. Recognition of the cause of colon cutoff sign on the computed tomographic scan is important because conventional radiography is often the first imaging modality requested for patients with abdominal complaints, but cannot give a confident correct diagnosis.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114meRwH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. There were no gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation. Chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted for presumed cholecystitis and treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Marked thrombocytopenia may arise from acute infection or medication toxicity, but autoimmunity, hypersplenism or an infiltrative process of the bone marrow must also be considered. The urinalysis results are compatible with pyelonephritis, but there is no history of dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Other explanations for the urinary findings include glomerulonephritis or urolithiasis. Endocarditis, via immune complex deposition, could cause this active urine sediment and involve the liver.

The laboratory tests point to a combined cholestatic and hepatocellular process. The AST to ALT ratio is compatible with alcoholic hepatitis, which can present with systemic toxicity and abdominal pain; therefore, revisiting the alcohol history would be logical here. Acetaminophen levels should be checked. The sonogram results, particularly the absence of gallstones, substantially lower the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, and the left-sided abdominal pain never really supported that diagnosis. Given the biochemical evidence of direct liver involvement and unexplained left upper quadrant pain, an abdominal CT is indicated.

She has a subacute illness associated with weight loss, night sweats, SIRS, prolonged fever, LUQ pain, hepatopathy and thrombocytopenia. Leading considerations include alcoholic hepatitis, SLE with autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma or an indolent infection. Her travel to Mexico and potential involvement of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow) renders tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), endocarditis (especially if she has undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease) and brucellosis distinct possibilities. HIV testing is also indicated.

The clinician has explicitly articulated the revised problem representation in the first sentence of the paragraph above. The new data have triggered new hypotheses (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis) and eliminated earlier hypotheses (e.g. cholecystitis). The next diagnostic test (abdominal CT) is chosen to identify features that discriminate among the competing diagnoses.

### US of right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department: diagnosing beyond gallbladder and biliary disease [^112jNZ25]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common diagnosable cause for right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain in patients who present to the emergency department (ED). However, over one-third of patients initially thought to have acute cholecystitis actually have RUQ pain attributable to other causes. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality of choice for initial imaging assessment and serves as a fast, cost-effective, and dynamic modality to provide a definitive diagnosis or a considerably narrowed list of differential possibilities. Multiple organ systems are included at standard RUQ US, and a variety of ultrasonographically diagnosable disease processes can be identified, including conditions of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and thoracic origin, all of which may result in RUQ pain. In certain cases, subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography, or cholescintigraphy may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and US findings. Familiarity with the spectrum of disease processes outside of the gallbladder and biliary tree that may manifest with RUQ pain and recognition at US of these alternative conditions is pivotal for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Diagnosis at the time of initial US can reduce unnecessary imaging and its consequences, including excess cost, radiation exposure, nephrotoxic contrast medium use, and time to diagnosis, thereby translating into improved patient care and outcome. This article (a) reviews the causes of RUQ pain identifiable at US using an organ-system approach, (b) illustrates the US appearance of select conditions from each organ system with multimodality imaging correlates, and (c) discusses the relevant pathophysiology and treatment of these entities to aid in efficient direction of management.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1135o27Q]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope — recurrent abdominal pain populations and prior workup applicability: The guideline is not intended to apply to patients who have not yet undergone evaluation of potential causes, and instead addresses patients who, despite prior medical evaluation for the cause of pain, have not had a cause identified, noting that ongoing or repeated medical evaluations may have risks and benefits that should be balanced such as cost, radiation exposure, and identification of incidental findings prompting further workup with uncertain benefit. The writing group also considered but ultimately did not include patients for whom the cause of recurrent abdominal pain has been identified or is very likely (e.g., pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, nephrolithiasis), even though these populations may suffer consequences of repeated radiation exposure from imaging and other negative effects of recurrent ED presentations.

### Sonography of acute cholecystitis and its mimics [^112EnirK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain is a common complaint. Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the primary diagnostic consideration in most adults presenting with acute onset RUQ abdominal pain; however, a variety of other conditions can mimic AC. Abdominal ultrasound (US) receives the highest score for imaging appropriateness for these patients. This article reviews the sonographic findings of uncomplicated and complicated AC and provides practical technical tips. The radiologist should be familiar with conditions that can mimic AC, be able to suggest these alternative diagnoses when findings are present on US, and recommend additional tests or procedures, if needed.

### The elusive diagnosis and emergent management of a late-presenting ruptured interstitial pregnancy: a case report [^112akxUL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old G3P2002 with two prior uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and no significant medical history presented at 15 3/7 weeks gestation by last menstrual period. She was brought in by emergency medical services due to a syncopal episode at home. Her history was notable for one-month of progressive abdominal pain and associated nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. She reported having regular follow-up with her obstetrician and multiple recent emergency department visits. She had no prior surgeries. Her vitals showed a heart rate in the 130s and her blood pressure was 76/43. On physical exam her abdomen was diffusely tender with peritoneal signs. Her labs were significant for a leukocytosis to 28,700, hemoglobin of 7.6, creatinine of 1.07 mg/dL and lactate of 5.7 mmol/L. Ultrasonography showed free fluid in the abdomen. Both the obstetrics and trauma surgery teams were immediately consulted as the source of her hemorrhagic shock was unknown. The patient became hemodynamically stable with resuscitation; so, the decision was made to proceed with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.

Concurrently, outside hospital records were made available and reviewed by both teams. They revealed that the patient had ultrasounds performed at 8 5/7, 12 4/7, and 13 0/7. Her ultrasound at 12 4/7 noted a possible arcuate uterus with the pregnancy located more on the patient's right. An additional scan at 13 0/7 reported suboptimal visualization of the pregnancy on both transabdominal scan and transvaginal scan. These records also showed that one week prior to presentation at our facility, the patient had gone to an outside emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. There she had an elevated white blood cell count to 18,000, a transabdominal ultrasound and abdominal MRI. Neither the ultrasound nor the MRI were interpreted as showing any acute abnormalities. Both specifically commented on there being an intrauterine pregnancy. The patient was discharged home from the outside emergency department with a presumed viral illness. A timeline of events is presented in Fig. 1.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic strategies

The fully paired study design, with all imaging tests in all patients and with the panel based final diagnosis as the reference standard, allowed a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. We compared the following single imaging strategies: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. In addition, we investigated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients and CT in those with a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography and (6) ultrasonography in all patients and CT only in patients with inconclusive ultrasonography.

We also investigated imaging strategies driven by patients' characteristics, in which only selected patients would have initial ultrasonography, with CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, whereas all others would have initial CT. For initial ultrasonography in these strategies, we selected (7) younger patients (< 45 years), for whom exposure to ionising radiation is most hazardous, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m²), in whom ultrasonography is more likely to be diagnostic. In another strategy (9) both younger and non-obese patients would have initial ultrasonography.

A common clinical view is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be guided by the location of pain. Therefore, we investigated strategies in which the selection of ultrasonography or CT was driven by the abdominal quadrant in which the pain was predominantly located. In strategy (10) the choice of investigation was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which recommend ultrasonography for pain in the right upper quadrant and computed tomography for pain in the other quadrants and for diffuse abdominal pain. In an alternative pain location driven strategy (11) patients with pain in the right upper quadrant or right lower quadrant would have initial ultrasonography and all others would have initial CT. The box summarises the strategies investigated.

### Subacute haemorrhagic acalculous cholecystitis after blunt trauma in a patient on anticoagulant therapy [^112VQQ9M]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemorrhagic cholecystitis is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly identified and treated. Known risk factors include trauma, anticoagulation use and cholelithiasis. In a patient with right upper quadrant pain after blunt trauma on anticoagulation without cholelithiasis, haemorrhagic acalculous cholecystitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, as appeared to be the case in the patient we present here. Fortunately, she recovered after temporisation with a cholecystostomy tube until she underwent more elective interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Avoid other imaging tests apart from ultrasound for the… [^111aRGpj]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic workup of acute right upper quadrant pain is informed by risk factors for cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound based on availability, examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. When the clinical features, examination, laboratory and ultrasound findings are congruent, no further imaging is required.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

GRACE-2 recurrent abdominal pain — definition for emergency department (ED) patients: Recurrent is defined as two or more prior similar episodes within a period of 12 months, with the time elapsed from the first episode to the current episode being greater than or equal to 30 days. For comparison, the criteria for recurrent abdominal pain established by Rome IV for irritable bowel syndrome require abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week in the past 3 months, with symptoms beginning at least 6 months prior to diagnosis, and recurrence was not intended to address repeated short-term presentations with an acute and evolving new abdominal syndrome.

### Jacuzzi jet-induced pneumoperitoneum [^116XGZQg]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum outside the setting of recent surgical intervention usually indicates perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. Following radiologic evidence of pneumoperitoneum, surgical exploration of the abdomen may be indicated depending on the nature of the patient's presentation. We present the radiological findings of a healthy young woman who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain and was found to have extensive pneumoperitoneum. No visceral disruption was evident by multidetector CT or by single-contrast barium fluoroscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Knowledge of benign causes of pneumoperitoneum by the radiologist may avert an unnecessary laparotomy.

### Fever and right upper quadrant pain in a pregnant woman at 30 weeks' gestation [^111UQtPp]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

A 34-year-old gravid woman with a history of ileal Crohn's disease presented at 30 weeks' gestation with a 2-week history of fever and right upper quadrant pain. An intra-abdominal abscess was suspected. Ultrasound and MRI failed to demonstrate the suspected abscess. Owing to ongoing pain and fever, the risk to the fetus of a CT scan were discussed with the patient, obstetricians and radiologists, with considerable debate about the possibility of other explanations for her symptoms. Ultimately, a CT scan revealed marked thickening of the distal ileum and confirmed diagnosis of an abscess in continuity with the inflamed bowel.

Investigations

Ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, urinalysis, urine culture and liver function tests.

Diagnosis

Crohn's disease flare complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess.

Management

Antibiotics (ceftizoxime, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium), parenteral nutrition and ileocecectomy.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm³ (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm³, platelet count 88,000/mm³, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### Abdominal pain in a postpartum patient [^111gf8Bi]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a very common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Making the correct diagnosis may be very complicated and difficult. It is even more difficult and complicated in the postpartum period, because other less common but important diagnoses must be considered. One of these potentially life-threatening diagnoses for which patients should be evaluated is uterine rupture.

Objectives

To discuss uncommon, but important, causes of abdominal pain that may occur in the postpartum period. To learn the clinical presentation, risk factors, evaluation, and management of uterine rupture in the postpartum patient.

Case Report

We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the ED with 2 days of abdominal pain and fever. The patient had had a caesarian section (C-section) 2 weeks before this admission. This was her fourth C-section. On examination, she had right lower quadrant tenderness. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained and it revealed uterine perforation with an adjacent abscess. The patient received intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A laparotomy was performed that confirmed the diagnosis of uterine perforation. The patient subsequently did very well.

Conclusions

Uterine perforation should be considered in any postpartum patient that presents with acute abdominal pain, especially if there are risk factors, such as previous C-sections. Appropriate evaluation, consultations, and management should be done expeditiously to avoid increased morbidity and mortality.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar pain in the abdomen. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

Investigations

History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

Diagnosis

Choledocholithiasis.

Management

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### An unusual diagnosis of splenic rupture [^112CNZ5x]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 22-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of worsening epigastric pain, non-productive cough and vomiting. On examination she was pale and had abdominal tenderness predominant in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal ultrasound excluded the presence of gall stones, but was unable to rule out free fluid in the abdomen. CT demonstrated extensive high-density ascites; however, no source of bleeding could be demonstrated. Clinically the patient's condition deteriorated, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed. In theatre the splenic capsule was found to have detached from the splenic body and emergency splenectomy was performed. Virology serology later demonstrated acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, although tissue microscopy and CMV staining were negative. No other cause of rupture was found. The interesting aspects of this case include the poor correlation between initial presenting symptoms and subsequent diagnosis, the difficulty encountered in making a firm diagnosis and the atypical cause of rupture.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Subcapsular liver hematoma after colonoscopy diagnosed by emergency department bedside ultrasonography [^112qJu3a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic subcapsular hematoma is an uncommon cause of right upper quadrant pain in the Emergency Department. It must be recognized early, as large volumes of acute blood loss and rupture into the peritoneum carry significant morbidity and mortality. In the absence of gallbladder disease, the differential diagnosis should include liver pathology. Bedside ultrasonography can be used to identify such lesions.

Objectives

To discuss the presentation, evaluation, and management options of hepatic subcapsular hematoma.

Case Report

We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with the chief complaint of right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right scapula 6 h after a screening colonoscopy for intestinal polyps. Emergency physician-performed bedside ultrasound revealed a large hyperechoic mass in the right lobe of the liver. Radiology-performed comprehensive ultrasound and subsequent computed tomography scan of her abdomen and pelvis revealed a subcapsular hematoma without intestinal perforation.

Conclusion

In a patient with undifferentiated right upper quadrant abdominal pain, bedside ultrasonography is a rapid and effective modality in the diagnosis of liver masses, including subcapsular hematoma.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^112rN9eN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^111k5AbT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Benefits and harms of repeating CTAP in low-risk recurrent abdominal pain — Evidence could not determine benefit in low-risk adults with recurrent and undifferentiated abdominal pain, although potential benefits might include improved diagnosis, diagnostic certainty, targeted therapy, reduced mortality, and fewer return emergency department visits. Availability is high, with CT in most U.S. emergency departments often 24 h/day. Per-patient radiation risk is described as small: each single CTAP increases attributable lifetime excess cancer risk by around 0.1% (20-year-old female), with a rate likely one in 1320 (60-year-old female), and a relative risk in exposed populations of around 1.0; these risks are small compared with repeat CTAP abnormality rates around 5%. The U.S. FDA notes some outliers may undergo enough repeat CTs for individual risk to meaningfully increase and that no threshold for safe or unsafe exposure exists; studies often report exposures within 1 year and cumulative doses such as 50 mSv, and risk is believed to follow a linear relationship with no threshold. Cost burden is noted, with a price range for CTAP of $1750-$9500, and repeated CTAP may add time burdens in already overcrowded emergency departments.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Evaluating patients with left upper quadrant pain [^117QVgn4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role in the evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department with acute left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain. Multidetector computed tomography is currently the primary modality used for imaging these patients. The peritoneal reflections, subperitoneal compartment, and peritoneal spaces of the LUQ are key anatomic features in understanding the imaging appearance of acute diseases in this area. Diseases of the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and splenic flexure are encountered in patients with acute LUQ pain. Optimization of the imaging protocol is vital for accurate diagnosis and characterization of these diseases in the acute setting.

### Epigastric pain… it's not always alcohol! an unusual presentation of caecal intussusception [^115H9rf9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Our patient is a 19-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after consuming 50–60 units of alcohol over a weekend. He presented with a 2-day history of right-upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain radiating to the back. On examination he was haemodynamically stable. His abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness in the RUQ, epigastric and right-iliac fossa areas. Laboratory results showed a slightly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Amylase and white cell count were normal. Ultrasound was performed raising the suspicion of intussusception. A CT scan was recommended and confirmed the presence of an intussusception. Once diagnosis was established, the patient had an emergency laparotomy and right hemicoloectomy, with per-operative findings consistent with the CT findings. This case illustrates the importance of keeping an open approach to all differentials while considering a diagnosis along with the importance of recognising intussusception when it occurs as complications can each represent a cause of mortality on their own.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight lower quadrant pain-suspected appendicitis [^1114v2Y1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain presenting to emergency departments in the United States, where the incidence continues to increase. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of experts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder: the "good omen" comet [^117YVx9w]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As emergency physicians perform bedside ultrasound with greater frequency, greater numbers of incidental and potentially unfamiliar sonographic findings will be encountered.

Objectives

Illustrate, discuss, and briefly review literature regarding one such finding and diagnosis in right upper quadrant sonography.

Case Report

A middle-aged woman was evaluated in the Emergency Department for abdominal pain. Limited bedside sonography of the gallbladder revealed mural thickening and comet-tailing. A diagnosis of adenomyomatosis was made.

Conclusion

Gallbladder adenomyomatosis can produce ultrasound findings similar to those of more serious and emergent gallbladder diseases. Cognizance of the sonographic details and typical clinical characteristics will allow the emergency physician to appropriately assess and disposition patients with this condition.

### Ring down artefacts on abdominal sonography to predict pulmonary abnormalities in the emergency department [^116ZSpKP]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Ring down artefacts are sometimes found when emergency physicians perform abdominal ultrasound to differentiate between various abdominal problems. We describe a patient who presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and whose ultrasound examination showed ring down artefacts posterior to the right hemidiaphragm, which led to the eventual diagnosis of pneumonia. Ring down artefacts on ultrasound may be used to predict pulmonary abnormalities. Awareness of this sonographic finding may assist in accurate diagnosis and administration of appropriate treatment without delay.

### Spontaneous superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection: an unusual cause of abdominal pain [^115XNARL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a 4-day history of severe, sharp left upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She had been seen 3 days prior at another Emergency Department, and had a negative work-up including a normal non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis for possible kidney stone. Vital signs were: temperature 36.3°C (97.3°F), pulse 100 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure 141/80 mm Hg. Physical examination was remarkable for marked tenderness in the left upper and middle quadrants and voluntary guarding. Bowel sounds were normal. Although laboratory studies were normal, a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast suggested a superior mesenteric artery dissection. This was confirmed with arteriography. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of superior mesenteric artery dissection are reviewed.

### A rare case of acute right-sided colonic diverticulitis presenting as pancreatitis [^116rPNVs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This case report highlights the clinical presentation, radiologic findings, and medical management of a case of right colonic diverticulitis (RCD) with concomitant pancreatitis, a rare and easily missed entity in the emergency department (ED) of Western hemisphere countries. In our report, we present and discuss a case of RCD that led to pancreatitis in a female Asian patient. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this disorder, and also discuss some complications associated with RCD. The importance of considering this pathologic entity within the ED differential even in those patients presumed to be at low risk for this condition is also explained, as this can prevent inappropriate surgical intervention for this presentation.

Case Report

We describe a 40-year-old Asian woman presenting for evaluation of epigastric pain and vomiting. She was initially thought to have cholecystitis or food poisoning, but had a normal ultrasound evaluation and ultimately had co-presenting RCD and pancreatitis diagnosed after computed tomography scanning. The patient was admitted and made a full recovery after receiving medical therapy and maintaining bowel rest. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of RCD and concomitant pancreatitis found in the modern literature. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe epigastric pain in young Asian patients with minimal risk factors may be RCD. This condition presents much like appendicitis, cholecystitis, or food poisoning, but must be considered among early differential diagnoses and evaluated appropriately in order to prevent unnecessary interventions.

### Right upper quadrant abdominal pain as the initial presentation of polyarteritis nodosa [^113ygPut]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotising vasculitis that involves medium and small vessels. PAN generally presents with constitutional, cutaneous, neurological, renal and gastrointestinal manifestations. However, PAN initially involving a single organ/system is uncommon. Here, we present a 42-year-old man who was hospitalised because of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain that started 2months before. Physical examination was remarkable for right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Abdominopelvic CT showed lymphadenopathy but no hepatic, gallbladder, pancreatic, intestinal or renal abnormalities. Abdominal angiography showed multiple small aneurysms located in the jejunal and hepatic arteries characteristic of PAN. He had a prompt and remarkable response to high-dose corticosteroids and oral cyclophosphamide. Our case, together with other reports, suggests that PAN should be considered in patients presenting with right upper abdominal pain. Timely diagnosis and treatment reduce the overall morbidity and mortality of the disease.

### Lithium-induced ECG modifications: navigating from acute coronary syndrome to Brugada syndrome [^11224Zmc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 52-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder, who had been treated for more than 10 years with lithium (1650 mg/day) and risperidone (2.5 mg/day). One week before admission, she presented to her general practitioner with a 2-day history of dry cough, sweats and feeling feverish. She was diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and was treated symptomatically. However, as symptoms persisted, she was addressed to our emergency department.

On admission, the patient was in delirium and complained of pain in the upper right abdominal quadrant. Clinical examination revealed fever (39°C), tachycardia with an irregular heart rhythm, a blood pressure of 149/87 mm Hg and tenderness of the upper right abdominal quadrant.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^112Yc9Ju]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Application of CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result (strategy 5) had a higher sensitivity than the clinical diagnosis without imaging: 94% versus 88% (P < 0.001). This conditional strategy would result in a significantly lower number of missed urgent conditions compared with CT only: 6% versus 11%, with a higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) but a lower specificity (P < 0.001). An alternative conditional strategy with CT only after inconclusive ultrasonography (strategy 6) would further reduce use of CT (27% of patients) but would increase the proportion of missed urgent conditions from 6% to 15%.

Five hundred and twelve (50%) patients were older than 45, and 157 (15%) patients had a body mass index exceeding 30. Nine per cent of urgent conditions would be missed with a strategy in which imaging is based on body mass index (strategy 8) compared with 10% for the strategies based on age (strategy 7) or on both age and body mass index (strategy 9). The diagnostic accuracy of the strategy reflecting the American College of Radiology guidelines (10) was comparable to that of the CT only strategy. The use of ultrasonography for both pain in the right upper quadrant and pain in the right lower quadrant (strategy 11) would lead to 16% missed urgent conditions.

Exposure to radiation

Table 2shows use of ultrasonography and CT for each strategy. CT related exposure to radiation would vary between 56% and 81% for the strategies driven by patients' characteristics and between 65% and 95% for the strategies driven by location of pain. The second lowest use of CT (49%) would be achieved with the conditional CT strategy, the strategy that also had the highest sensitivity in detecting urgent diagnoses.

### Spontaneous hepatic rupture caused by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome [^115i7bvN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The causes of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome or hepatic hemorrhage as a serious complication of HELLP are not known. Although spontaneous hepatic rupture associated with HELLP syndrome is a rare complication of pregnancy, hepatic rupture results in life-threatening complications. The cornerstone of prognosis is early diagnosis. Hepatic rupture in HELLP syndrome should be considered a differential diagnosis in pregnant patients with sudden onset of abdominal pain or hypotension. We report a case of 30-year-old primigravida female with spontaneous hepatic rupture caused by HELLP syndrome as a presenting symptom of right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

### Symptomatic cholelithiasis of a remnant gallbladder after open cholecystectomy [^115td62r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy, known as postcholecystectomy syndrome, requires a broad differential diagnosis. Pathology of a retained gallbladder remnant is an exceedingly rare etiology of this pain.

Case Report

A 49-year-old woman who had previously undergone an open cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with several hours of postprandial RUQ pain and emesis. Liver function tests and lipase were not significantly elevated. RUQ ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure containing a stone with mild prominence of the common bile duct at 7 mm, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed the presence of a remnant gallbladder without common bile duct obstruction. Her pain subsided, she tolerated a diet, and was discharged with a referral for an elective cholecystectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department in the United States, and emergency physicians routinely encounter patients with postcholecystectomy syndrome. Emergency physicians should not exclude the possibility of remnant gallbladder pathology, such as symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, in patients presenting with symptoms concerning for biliary colic, even if the patient has undergone previous cholecystectomy.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### A surprising cause of acute right upper quadrant pain [^116uf6Ki]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 42 year-old African-American woman was admitted for severe acute right upper quadrant pain. Her liver function tests showed a cholestatic pattern of hepatitis. She had no known history of liver disease or sarcoidosis. Imaging of her liver and biliary tree did not reveal any apparent cause for her right upper quadrant pain. A liver biopsy was performed which showed granulomatous disease. This prompted a CT chest that showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the mediastinal lymphnode revealed non-caseating granulomas. Despite having no pulmonary symptoms or history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, she was diagnosed with systemic pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was treated with corticosteroids and had complete resolution of symptoms over the next several weeks.

### Nontraumatic abdominal emergencies: acute abdominal pain: diagnostic strategies [^113V1JGd]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Common causes of acute abdominal pain include appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, urinary colic, perforated peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, and nonspecific, nonsurgical abdominal pain. The topographic classification of acute abdominal pain (pain in one of the four abdominal quadrants, diffuse abdominal pain, flank or epigastric pain) facilitates the choice of the imaging technique. The initial radiological evaluation often consists of plain abdominal radiography, despite significant diagnostic limitations. The traditional indications for plain films — bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, and the search of ureteral calculi — are questioned by helical computed tomography (CT). Although ultrasonography (US) is in many centers the modality of choice for imaging the gallbladder and the pelvis in children and women of reproductive age, CT is considered to be one of the most valued tools for triaging patients with acute abdominal pain. CT is particularly beneficial in patients with marked obesity, unclear US findings, bowel obstruction, and multiple lesions. The introduction of multidetector row CT (MDCT) has further enhanced the utility of CT in imaging patients with acute abdominal pain.

### Isolated adrenal hematoma presenting as acute right upper quadrant pain [^113VorgW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Adrenal hematoma is an infrequent occurrence in the setting of adult trauma care. It is typically associated with diffuse abdominal injury, and its presence is commonly correlated with high injury severity and mortality.

Objectives

To discuss the recognition of adrenal hematoma as a cause of right upper quadrant pain.

Case Report

We present the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute right upper quadrant pain after blunt trauma to the area; he was initially diagnosed with an abdominal contusion with an incidental adrenal adenoma. After experiencing continued pain for 2 days, the patient returned to the ED for re-evaluation. Subsequent imaging revealed that the adrenal mass had enlarged, and it was determined that this patient had suffered an acute adrenal hematoma. The lesion was determined to be self-limited and the patient was treated with supportive care. Follow-up images 8 weeks later revealed resolution of the hematoma and the patient reported complete resolution of symptoms. We also discuss adrenal hematoma in the trauma setting and explain that in our patient, given the clinical scenario and statistical evidence, an initial diagnosis of adrenal hematoma should be favored over abdominal contusion with incidental adenoma.

Conclusion

We describe a case of a traumatic isolated adrenal hematoma that presents acutely as right upper quadrant pain. This unusual presentation highlights the need for recognition of the adrenal gland as a potential cause of right upper quadrant pain in the trauma setting.

### Right upper quadrant pain: ultrasound first! [^114TCGGR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments and outpatient medical practices, and is most commonly attributable to biliary and hepatic pathology. Ultrasound should be used as a first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and cholecystitis, as it allows the differentiation of medical and surgical causes of upper abdominal pathology, and in many circumstances is sufficient to guide patient management. Knowledge of strengths and limitations of ultrasound in the evaluation of RUQ is paramount in correct diagnosis. A spectrum of RUQ pathology for which a RUQ ultrasound examination should reasonably be considered as the initial imaging modality of choice will be reviewed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right upper quadrant pain: 2022 update [^111s74rW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in hospital emergency departments, as well as outpatient settings. Although gallstone-related acute cholecystitis is a leading consideration in diagnosis, a myriad of extrabiliary sources including hepatic, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, and musculoskeletal should also be considered. This document focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies performed specifically to evaluate acute right upper quadrant pain, with biliary etiologies including acute cholecystitis and its complications being the most common. An additional consideration of extrabiliary sources such as acute pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, hepatitis, and painful liver neoplasms remain a diagnostic consideration in the right clinical setting. The use of radiographs, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI for these indications are discussed. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^1174xBBo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1166LKz4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### Amebic liver abscess [^114Wqmu6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

A 45 year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of constant right upper quadrant abdominal pain, 20-lb weight loss, and worsening fevers. The patient had immigrated to the United States from Mexico 7 years earlier. She was febrile, experienced pain with light palpation of the right upper quadrant, and had normal serum transaminases, normal alkaline phosphatase, and mildly elevated total bilirubin of 1.1 mg/dL. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed contiguous peripherally enhancing, thick-walled, hypodense hepatic dome abscesses measuring 9.5 × 6.1 cm (Figures 1 and 2) Entamoeba histolytica serology was positive, and the size of the lesions halved after 4 days of metronidazole and symptoms rapidly resolved. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan that can cause asymptomatic colonization, amebic colitis, or extraintestinal abscesses.–Transmission of infective cysts is fecal-oral, and patients usually have a history of exposure from an endemic area. Symptoms include a history of fever and right upper quadrant pain. Diagnosis can be aided with imaging studies and confirmed with serological studies and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Invasive disease should be treated with metronidazole for 10 days and paromomycin to eliminate colonization for 7 days. In rare cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity.

### Fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome: CT findings of three cases [^1156uQ4y]. Emergency Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations and computed tomography (CT) findings of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) are relatively well stabilized as right upper quadrant abdominal pain and hepatic capsular enhancement because of perihepatitis associated with pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. We encountered three patients with serial FHCS associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, who visited the emergency room with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed hepatic capsular or pericapsular enhancement along the anterior surface of the liver on the arterial phase. Recently, multi-detector CT has evolved as the first-line imaging modality of acute abdomen at the emergency room; we reemphasized the importance of the CT findings of this syndrome for differential diagnosis of right upper quadrant abdominal pain in sexually active young women. Physicians at the emergency room acknowledge the syndrome and should perform dynamic abdominopelvic CT including the arterial phase.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AnYmS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our review also found that nearly half of individuals with EOCRC reported abdominal pain, based on evidence from 73 studies, and a 1.3- to 6-fold positive association with EOCRC risk across 4 studies. Given its association with a myriad of gastrointestinal conditions, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends computed tomography for evaluating patients with acute right or left lower quadrant abdominal pain and ultrasonography for right upper quadrant pain, though the guidelines also recommend identifying associated symptoms to better focus a differential diagnosis. It may be inefficient and unrealistic to perform colonoscopy for all adults younger than 45 years with isolated abdominal pain, given the low diagnostic yieldand insufficient capacity across the US to accommodate this group. Nevertheless, the fact that 40% of patients with EOCRC presented with abdominal pain and 27% presented with altered bowel habits reinforces that any new symptom should be comprehensively evaluated by a clinician. Our findings suggest that EOCRC should be part of the initial differential diagnosis, and that a plan for follow-up should be in place, such as a 30- to 60-day follow-up visit to confirm whether the original working diagnosis was correct, the red flag sign or symptom has resolved, or to refer for colonoscopy to exclude EOCRC if these criteria are not met. We postulate that all benign causes of red flag signs or symptoms either can be diagnostically confirmed or should resolve with initial treatment. When an alternative diagnosis is not confirmed or signs or symptoms fail to resolve, a colonoscopy to rule out EOCRC should be pursued. Abdominal pain could serve as a marker to prompt further patient-clinician discussion about additional medical history, which could help determine whether further diagnostic work-up is warranted.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Emergent right upper quadrant sonography [^113NwiwF]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this presentation is to review the sonographic spectrum of disease entities evaluated by right upper quadrant (RUQ) sonography on an emergent basis.

Methods

Right upper quadrant sonography was performed on an emergent basis in patients who came to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suspicious for or simulating acute cholecystitis or diseases of the liver and biliary tree.

Results

A wide gamut of acute and chronic cholecystitis and diseases of the liver and biliary tree were visualized on RUQ sonography. Several other entities in addition to hepatic and biliary disease were also suspected on sonography and further evaluated by computed tomography.

Conclusions

Right upper quadrant sonography is the first line of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic, gallbladder, or biliary disease as well as RUQ pain. Patient triage or additional imaging may be obtained on the basis of emergent RUQ sonographic findings.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® left lower quadrant pain: 2023 update [^1147mvFJ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for left lower quadrant pain is wide and conditions range from the benign and self-limited to life-threatening surgical emergencies. Along with patient history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, imaging is often critical to limit the differential diagnosis and identify life-threatening abnormalities. This document will discuss the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the initial workup for patients who present with left lower quadrant pain, patients with suspected diverticulitis, and patients with suspected complications from diverticulitis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^111wABHK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### Epiploic appendagitis: a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen [^113WG96r]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Two patients, a 53-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, presented at the Emergency Department of our hospital with symptoms of acute abdomen without concomitant fever. They both complained of severe acute abdominal pain localized at the right and left lower quadrants respectively, worsening during the last couple of hours, accompanied by moderate nausea. Rebound tenderness was present in the right and left lower abdominal quadrants respectively, with absence of other pathological findings on physical examination. In this setting our diagnostic thought was guided to the possibility of acute appendicitis in the first patient and acute diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or ruptured ovarian cyst in the second one. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. Both patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 1A - D), which established the diagnosis of primary epiploic appendagitis (EA). Patients were administered a single dose of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug intramuscularly with significant clinical improvement and were discharged from the Emergency Department with a short course of ibuprofen and advice to seek medical attention if symptoms worsened. Their clinical response was excellent and symptoms totally resolved three days later.

### Severe upper abdominal pain in a 43-year-old woman [^114ZhkJo]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 43-year-old healthy woman was transferred to our hospital due to severe upper abdominal pain during lunch. On arrival to the hospital she lost consciousness, had no pulse and no blood pressure; hence, the cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and the patient was intubated. Echocardiography performed during the resuscitation revealed ejection fraction of 5% with global hypokinesia. The patient was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was transferred to the catheterisation laboratory. The initial angiography and the post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) images are shown in figure 1.heartjnl;103/20/1650/F1F1F1Figure 1Images of (A) initial angiography and (B) post percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Right lower quadrant pain in a young female: ultrasound diagnosis of rectus abdominis tear [^113sqmdW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right lower quadrant pain in young females presents a frequent diagnostic challenge for emergency physicians, with a broad differential and several important diagnoses. Using an "ultrasound first" imaging strategy can help decrease the use of computed tomography scans, with associated savings in radiation exposure, cost, and other resource use.

Case Report

We report a case of right lower quadrant pain in a young woman. After her initial history and physical examination, appendicitis was the leading differential. A bedside ultrasound was performed, leading to the uncommon diagnosis of rectus abdominis muscle tear. The sonographic findings of a muscle tear include increase in size, loss of linear, homogeneous architecture, and decreased echogenicity. Making this diagnosis at the bedside using ultrasound obviated the need for further imaging, avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, and decreasing emergency department length of stay and overall cost, while leading to a tailored treatment plan. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Rectus abdominis tear is a cause of right lower quadrant pain that may mimic appendicitis and should be considered in patients with this complaint. The ability to make this diagnosis with bedside ultrasound may assist in several important patient-oriented outcomes.

### A 52-year-old man with abdominal pain and jaundice [^115Sj1p7]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with subacute abdominal pain and jaundice. Fever, worsening liver function tests, and multi-organ failure developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Epiploic appendagitis with acute appendicitis [^114PLEa4]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented to accident and emergency department with a 1-day history of right-sided abdominal pain. She was afebrile, and haemodynamically stable, and the initial diagnosis was acute appendicitis. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed and was suggestive of appendicitis. The patient failed to improve with conservative management, and a laparosocopic appendicectomy was performed the next day to remove an inflamed, non-perforated appendix. Pelvic laparoscopy was performed, which noted normal ovaries and uterus, as well as a hard, swollen, discoloured epiploic appendage of the sigmoid colon. A decision was made not to remove the inflamed epiploic appendage. Postoperatively the patient complained of persisting pain, which settled over 2 days with analgesia and antibiotics. This case is an extremely unusual case of epiploic appendagitis and acute appendicitis. It demonstrates the importance of pelvic laparoscopy in all females with presumed appendicitis, even in the presence of an initial pathology.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Right upper quadrant pain after previous blunt abdominal trauma: undiagnosed traumatic diaphragmatic hernia with strangulated right colon [^115Yqo1q]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s self-presented to an emergency department in a major trauma centre with severe right-sided abdominal pain, a tender right upper quadrant mass and chest pain. Diagnostic imaging showed a previously undiagnosed diaphragmatic hernia containing strangulated right colon. The patient had been the victim of a high-energy road traffic accident 18 months earlier, but at that time had not presented to hospital or undergone any outpatient investigation. This emergency presentation necessitated an emergency laparotomy, right colectomy, suture repair of diaphragmatic hernia and formation of ileo-colostomy. While a small number of similar cases have been documented, right-sided traumatic diaphragmatic herniae (TDH), where abdominal viscera bypass the liver and subsequently strangulate, are exceedingly rare. The evidence on delayed diagnosis of TDH is discussed and a system of follow-up for patients who suffer blunt abdominal trauma which is managed non-operatively is suggested.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1155jpvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical case presentation

An 81-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and a laparotomic appendectomy when she was 12 years old presents to the emergency department with intermittent acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The last defecation was 2 days ago, and the bowel is closed to gas. Current medications only include valsartan 80 mg daily. The body temperature is 37.5 °C, and all vital parameters are normal. The remainder of the examination demonstrates pain and localized peritonism in the lower right quadrant. Laboratory tests are normal except white blood cells at 14,000 per microliter.

Questions include the following: How should this patient be evaluated and treated? What is the working diagnosis? Options include stump appendicitis, right colon diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, right renal colic, right colon cancer, bowel ischemia, or inflammatory bowel disease (Fig. 1).
