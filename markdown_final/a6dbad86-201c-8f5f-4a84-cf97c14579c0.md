## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which reinforcement schedule results in maintenance of behavior that is least resistant to extinction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that partial reinforcement produces greater resistance to extinction than continuous reinforcement. Then, I should verify which schedules are partial versus continuous and how that maps to extinction resistance. Next, I will examine the provided options and eliminate the partial schedules. After that, I need to compare continuous schedules and consider whether any modifiers like "long intervals" change extinction vulnerability. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the best answer with a clear rationale.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle. Partial reinforcement schedules, where reinforcement is not delivered after every response, generate more persistent, extinction-resistant behavior than continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced. This is the partial reinforcement extinction effect, and it is a robust phenomenon across species and paradigms, including nocebo conditioning studies that show PRF is harder to extinguish than CRF [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the schedule taxonomy so I don't misclassify anything. Continuous reinforcement (CRF) delivers reinforcement after every target response, whereas partial reinforcement includes fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, and variable interval schedules. The latter four are all partial and therefore generally more resistant to extinction than CRF, which is the least resistant to extinction among the major schedule types [^a3b5944d].

> I will now examine the options and separate partial from continuous. Options A, B, C, F, G, H, I, and J are all partial schedules (VR, VI, FR, FI, and their variants), so they should be more extinction-resistant and therefore not the correct answer to "least resistant". Options D and E are continuous schedules, so they are the only plausible candidates for the least extinction-resistant behavior [^a3b5944d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the continuous options. Option E is simply "continuous", while option D is "continuous with long intervals". I initially thought the "long intervals" might make D even less resistant to extinction, but wait, that would be a mistake because the defining feature of continuous reinforcement is that every response is reinforced regardless of the inter-reinforcement interval; adding "long intervals" does not convert CRF into a partial schedule, so both D and E remain continuous and similarly vulnerable to extinction compared with partial schedules [^a3b5944d].

> Let me reconsider the nuance. If the question is strictly about which is least resistant among the listed choices, and both D and E are continuous, then either could be argued as correct. However, the most straightforward, unambiguous answer is the plain continuous schedule (E), because it captures the core principle without introducing unnecessary modifiers that could confuse interpretation; moreover, no evidence in the provided sources suggests that "long intervals" within a continuous schedule further weaken extinction resistance beyond the inherent vulnerability of CRF itself [^a3b5944d].

> But wait, what if the test writer intended to distinguish continuous schedules by interval length? I should double-check whether any source supports that distinction affecting extinction. I find no evidence that longer intervals within a continuous schedule meaningfully change extinction vulnerability compared with a standard continuous schedule, so the safest, reference-aligned choice remains the basic continuous reinforcement option, E [^a3b5944d].

> Final answer: E. Continuous reinforcement produces behavior that is least resistant to extinction because every response is reinforced, making the contingency most salient and most fragile when reinforcement stops, whereas partial schedules foster persistence during extinction [^a3b5944d].

---

The schedule that produces behavior **least resistant to extinction** is **continuous reinforcement** (E). This is because every response is reinforced, so the organism quickly detects when reinforcement stops and the behavior extinguishes rapidly. In contrast, **partial reinforcement schedules** (variable ratio, fixed ratio, variable interval, fixed interval) create stronger resistance to extinction due to the unpredictability of reinforcement, making the organism persist longer when reinforcement is withdrawn [^a3b5944d].

---

## Reinforcement schedules and extinction resistance

Extinction resistance refers to how persistent a behavior remains after reinforcement is removed. Schedules with **intermittent reinforcement** (partial schedules) produce more persistent behavior than continuous reinforcement, a phenomenon known as the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) [^a3b5944d].

| **Schedule type** | **Description** | **Extinction resistance** |
|-|-|-|
| Continuous reinforcement (CRF) | Every response is reinforced | Least resistant |
| Fixed ratio (FR) | Reinforcement after a fixed number of responses | Moderately resistant |
| Variable ratio (VR) | Reinforcement after a variable number of responses | Highly resistant |
| Fixed interval (FI) | Reinforcement after a fixed time interval | Moderately resistant |
| Variable interval (VI) | Reinforcement after a variable time interval | Highly resistant |

---

## Why continuous reinforcement is least resistant to extinction

Continuous reinforcement produces behavior that is **least resistant to extinction** because:

- **Immediate detection of change**: The organism quickly notices when reinforcement stops, leading to rapid extinction.
- **Strong response-reinforcement association**: Continuous reinforcement creates a clear, predictable link between behavior and reward, so any disruption is immediately apparent.
- **Rapid decline in response rate**: Once reinforcement ceases, the response rate drops quickly due to the lack of intermittent reinforcement maintaining the behavior.

---

## Comparison with other schedules

- **Fixed ratio (FR)**: Reinforcement after a fixed number of responses; more resistant than continuous but less than variable schedules.
- **Variable ratio (VR)**: Reinforcement after a variable number of responses; highly resistant due to unpredictability.
- **Fixed interval (FI)**: Reinforcement after a fixed time interval; moderately resistant.
- **Variable interval (VI)**: Reinforcement after a variable time interval; highly resistant due to unpredictability.

---

## Experimental evidence

Studies consistently show that continuous reinforcement results in **faster extinction** than partial schedules. For example, research on nocebo hyperalgesia demonstrates that continuous reinforcement produces less persistent effects than partial reinforcement, highlighting the role of intermittency in strengthening resistance to extinction [^a3b5944d].

---

## Conclusion

Continuous reinforcement (E) produces behavior that is **least resistant to extinction** because the organism immediately detects when reinforcement stops, leading to rapid extinction. Partial reinforcement schedules, by contrast, create greater persistence due to their unpredictability.

Conclusion

It is extremely important to include appropriate variables in prediction modelling, as model's performance largely depends on which variables are ultimately included in the model. Failure to include the proper variables in the model provides inaccurate results, and the model will fail to capture the true relation that exists in the data between the outcome and the selected variables. There are numerous occasions when prediction models are developed without following the proper steps or adopting the proper method of variable selection. Researchers need to be more aware of and cautious about these very important aspects of prediction modelling.

### Random effects: variance is the spice of life [^c54307ed]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Covariates in regression analyses allow us to understand how independent variables of interest impact our dependent outcome variable. Often, we consider fixed effects covariates (e.g., gender or diabetes status) for which we examine subjects at each value of the covariate. We examine both men and women and, within each gender, examine both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Occasionally, however, we consider random effects covariates for which we do not examine subjects at every value. For example, we examine patients from only a sample of hospitals and, within each hospital, examine both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The random sampling of hospitals is in contrast to the complete coverage of all genders. In this column I explore the differences in meaning and analysis when thinking about fixed and random effects variables.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^77c5d325]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Through simply dividing the standard deviation by the mean, the CV arose as an attempted solution to the mean-dependence of measures of dispersion and heterogeneity. For this reason, it is widely suggested and used without any assessment of dependence on the mean. The crucial assumption inherent to the calculation of the CV is that there is a linear dependence between the standard deviation and the mean. However, this assumption can be easily rejected when considering a variable with an upper and lower bound (double-bounded hereafter). In the case of a double-bounded variable, the standard deviation is maximised when the distribution's mean is centred between the lower and upper boundaries, because as the mean increases beyond this centre the distribution must become increasingly concentrated at the upper boundary (Fig. 2 i, n). As a result, dividing the standard deviation by the mean exacerbates the measure's decrease as the mean increases beyond the centre and towards the upper boundary (Fig. 2 o). The problem is furthered still when one realises the rate of change in standard deviation increases as the mean approaches the lower boundary, which influences both lower-bounded and double-bounded variables (Fig. 2 f, n). Intuitively this is expected because when the mean is far from the boundaries the increased clustering of the tails of the distribution have a smaller effect on the standard deviation compared to when the mean is close to a boundary (Fig. 2 a, i; see methods for rigorous definitions for gamma- and beta-distributed variables). As a result, dividing the standard deviation by the mean creates a nonlinear negative dependence between the CV and the mean for all bounded variables (Fig. 2 g, o). See methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for demonstration of the CV as a measure of skewness rather than dispersion, explaining earlier empirical results showing linear dependence between the CV and skewness.

### Variable selection strategies and its importance in clinical prediction modelling [^cb4b1d7d]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Existing theory and literature, as well as experience and clinical knowledge, provide a general idea as to which candidate variables should be considered for inclusion in a prediction model. Nevertheless, the actual variables used in the final prediction model should be determined by analysing the data. Determining the set of variables for the final model is called variable selection. Variable selection serves two purposes. First, it helps determine all of the variables that are related to the outcome, which makes the model complete and accurate. Second, it helps select a model with few variables by eliminating irrelevant variables that decrease the precision and increase the complexity of the model. Ultimately, variable selection provides a balance between simplicity and fit. Figure 1 describes the steps to follow in variable selection during model building.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) CTG repeat ranges and clinical sensitivity — Fully-variable DMPK alleles in the range of 50 to 100 repeats can be identified in asymptomatic or minimally affected individuals, and factors such as age, family history, penetrance, and variable expressivity preclude an accurate determination of clinical sensitivity and specificity for individuals with 1 or both alleles in this range; for CTG repeats > 100, the clinical sensitivity and specificity is high and expected to approach 100%. Variable-allele sizes of 35 to 49 CTG repeats are rare, and reference materials exist that possess the normal range of CTG repeats (5 to 34 repeats), variable range (35–49 repeats), and fully-variable number of CTG repeats (50 repeats).

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^b298ece6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex as a biological variable (SABV) in preclinical lung disease models — study design and reporting guidance emphasizes a 2 × 2 factorial design and explicit sex-based reporting. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, each sex is represented within the two treatment or intervention groups, and factorial designs incorporate at least two factors, with at least two levels each, enabling answers to whether outcomes differ between treated and control groups, between males and females, and whether there is an interaction between biological sex and treatment or intervention. When reporting study findings, it is essential to provide specific information to ensure reproducibility and minimize bias, and in the methods section it is crucial to state the sex of biological replicates and how that was assessed, the respective sample size, and a justification of power or otherwise the ability to detect sex-based effects; if available, researchers should include sex-specific biological variables such as estrous cycle status, developmental stage, and hormone levels. For in vitro studies, the sex of the cells used and the culturing conditions (e.g., phenol red–free and/or charcoal-stripped media) should be documented, and the figures and tables in the manuscript should display all data disaggregated by sex using distinct visual markers and including both significant and nonsignificant findings and effect sizes for sex differences. Table 3 summarizes the major recommendations for incorporating SABV in preclinical models of lung disease, and a checklist (Table 4) for the inclusion and analysis of SABV in the model, which researchers and reviewers can use, has been included in the online supplement.

Variability in clinical practice — the weight given to facts and reasons for a clinical decision can differ between clinicians, resulting in variability; factors beyond study design and execution can make clinical research results more compelling and are summarized in Table 2, but no particular clinical study can be expected to satisfy all criteria; when research results are not compelling, clinicians will be more likely to weight experiential or pathophysiologic knowledge more heavily, so clinicians can reasonably come to a different clinical conclusion even when considering the same research; differences may derive from differing professional values and prior knowledge, and making the clinical decision-making process explicit will aid in identifying the sources of variability in practice.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^b7bc7dc1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex-related categories and considerations in preclinical models — definitions and cell-based implications are outlined: Dimorphism, sex differences, and sex convergence and divergence are defined such that outcomes can differ by sex, be quantitatively different, or be the same with different pathophysiological mechanisms; differences may be absent at baseline but appear after challenges such as injury or stress. In cell-based models, the biological sex of primary cells or cell lines is often not specified despite cellular sex profoundly influencing phenotype, function, and responses; sex differences can arise from gonadal hormones or sex chromosomes, and mammalian cells show intrinsic sex-specific differences and respond differently to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors.

### Introduction to statistical modelling 2: categorical variables and interactions in linear regression [^5a3f2495]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

In the first article in this series we explored the use of linear regression to predict an outcome variable from a number of predictive factors. It assumed that the predictive factors were measured on an interval scale. However, this article shows how categorical variables can also be included in a linear regression model, enabling predictions to be made separately for different groups and allowing for testing the hypothesis that the outcome differs between groups. The use of interaction terms to measure whether the effect of a particular predictor variable differs between groups is also explained. An alternative approach to testing the difference between groups of the effect of a given predictor, which consists of measuring the effect in each group separately and seeing whether the statistical significance differs between the groups, is shown to be misleading.

### The relationship between objective frequency-volume chart data and the I-PSS in men with lower urinary tract symptoms [^ea041ea3]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) is considered a benchmark in defining the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, its relationship with variables of the frequency-volume (FV) chart, an objective measure of LUTS, is not well understood. We analyzed this relationship between the I-PSS and FV chart variables in men with LUTS.

Methods

Patients referred for the investigation of uncomplicated LUTS completed an I-PSS and a 3-d FV chart. Correlation coefficients were used to describe the relationship between total I-PSS and its components with the FV variables. The distributions of FV variable scores within the categories of I-PSS severity were also examined. The effect of patient's quality of life score on I-PSS and FV variables was analyzed using regression.

Results

A total of 104 patients completed both the I-PSS and FV chart. The association between FV variables and I-PSS scores was generally weak, with 24-h frequency being the strongest (r = 0.43) and with considerable overlap within each severity category. There was weak association between the I-PSS for nocturia and urgency and their FV counterparts. The number of self-reported nocturnal voids tended to be overestimated. These discrepancies were partly explained by the patient's quality of life rating, which reduced the level of variation between I-PSS score and FV variables and accounted for some of the overestimation.

Conclusion

Weak associations were found between the self-rated I-PSS scores and FV measures of voiding, suggesting that the accurate assessment of LUTS requires self-reported measures of symptoms and objective measures of voiding behaviour. Significant differences between the two types of data might be explained by perceived quality of life.

### Evaluation of pre-exposure vaccine effectiveness against mpox during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak in the Madrid region (Spain): a test-negative design [^c4b20377]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Variables and measurement

The study factors were as follows: the time elapsed in weeks from vaccination to onset of symptoms of suspected mpox (, continuous variable), with 8 or more weeks grouped at week 8 by considering that the increase in the immune response from that moment is negligible; and the vaccination status (, binary variable) assuming that an individual had been vaccinated if an induction period of 2 weeks has elapsed prior to the suspected mpox.

As a response variable (C, binary), the classification of cases or controls was based on the result of the test.

The control variables were age (A, continuous variable), legal sex as recorded in the sanitary registry (S, dichotomous variable), history of HIV infection (H, dichotomous variable), HIV PrEP user (P, dichotomous variable), the number of sexually transmitted infections (STI) under epidemiological surveillance (syphilis, gonococcal infection, lymphogranuloma venereum and infection by Chlamydia trachomatis) during the year prior to suspicion excluding those in the last week (, integer variable), continent of birth (B, categorical variable) and average personal net income (I, continuous variable) in the 2020 census tract of residence.

Finally, for adjustment according to temporal and spatial trends during the evolution of the outbreak: the number of confirmed cases (, integer variable) in the census tract of residence (excluding the case if it is a confirmed case with a positive test) and, as calendar date, the month (M, categorical variable) of suspected mpox.

Statistical methods

The surveillance database was scrubbed for inaccuracies to find, examine and correct any missing, unreliable or incorrect values. In addition, the missing information in the CND database on HIV PrEP was completed with the data obtained from the registry of the CM.

The χ² test, Fisher's exact test or the t-test according to the type of variable (categorical or continuous) was used to describe the characteristics of cases and controls.

The measure of VE was calculated using logistic regression with theas the measure of association, using the formulafor the estimation of VE.

For crude effectiveness estimates, the OR estimated by simple logistic regression was used, with the study factor being vaccination status or the time elapsed from vaccination to suspected mpox and the response variable being the PCR result (which classifies suspicions as cases or controls).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### Diagnostic criteria for primary immunodeficiencies. representing PAGID (pan-American group for immunodeficiency) and ESID (European society for immunodeficiencies) [^ad20778d]. Clinical Immunology (1999). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for common variable immunodeficiency" for common variable immunodeficiency.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The clinical purpose of the criteria is to facilitate the diagnosis of CVID, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and an increased susceptibility to infections. The intended patient population includes individuals who present with recurrent infections and are suspected of having an immunodeficiency disorder.

The key components of the Diagnostic Criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency include the measurement of serum immunoglobulin G and A levels, with a decrease of at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age being indicative of CVID. Additionally, a decrease in any of the immunoglobulin isotypes (M, G, and A) of at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age is also considered. The criteria also take into account the age of onset of immunodeficiency, with a requirement of the onset being at or after 2 years of age. The presence of absent isohemagglutinins and/or a poor response to vaccines is another component of the criteria. Lastly, the criteria necessitate the exclusion of defined causes of hypogammaglobulinemia to ensure that the immunodeficiency is not secondary to another condition.

The tool assesses whether an individual meets the criteria for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) based on specific diagnostic factors. Five criteria guide the evaluation process, used to determine if the individual falls into categories of "Probable CVID", "Possible CVID", or if the criteria are not met.

Key criteria include:

- Decreased serum immunoglobulin G and A at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age.
- Decreased serum immunoglobulin in any of the isotypes (M, G, and A) at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age.
- Onset of immunodeficiency at 2 years of age or older.
- Absent isohemagglutinins and/or poor response to vaccines.
- Exclusion of defined causes of hypogammaglobulinemia.

The interpretation process involves checking these combinations:

- "Probable CVID" is indicated if criteria A (Decreased serum immunoglobulin G and A at least 2 SD below the mean for age), C, D, and E are selected. This set confirms that specific immunoglobulin levels are low, the onset age is appropriate, and there is no response to key immunity tests, while ruling out other known causes.

- "Possible CVID" is suggested if the input includes B (Decreased serum immunoglobulin in any of the isotype M, G, and A at least 2 SD below the mean for age), C, D, and E. This acknowledges a broader range of low immunoglobulin type but still needs to meet the other criteria.

- If the selected criteria do not match either configuration exactly, the classification is that "Diagnostic criteria are not met". This means the individual's condition doesn't squarely fit the patterns recognized for any form of CVID.

This structured approach helps clinicians systematically align patient symptoms and test results with known diagnostic frameworks for CVID, guiding proper assessment and possible confirmation or exclusion of the condition.

### Variable selection strategies and its importance in clinical prediction modelling [^3e407d09]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Variable reduction strategies

One way to restrict the list of potential variables is to choose the candidate variables first, particularly, if the sample is small. Candidate variables for a specific topic are those that have demonstrated previous prognostic performance with the outcome. Candidate variables for a specific topic can be selected based on subject matter knowledge before a study begins. This can be achieved by reviewing the existing literature on the topic and consulting with experts in the area. In addition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be performed to identify candidate variables. With respect to systematic reviews, counting the number of times a variable was found important/significant in the different studies has been shown to be helpful in identifying candidate variables.

Grouping/combining similar, related variables based on subject knowledge and statistical technique can also help restrict the number of variables. If variables are strongly correlated, combining them into a single variable has been considered prudent. For example, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are strongly correlated. In choosing between the two, mean blood pressure may be a better option than selecting either one of them individually. However, it has also been argued that variables that are highly correlated should be excluded a priori as they provide little independent information. Removing a correlated variable should not affect the performance of the model, as it measures the same underlying information as the variable to which it correlates. Ultimately, both combining correlated variables and excluding them beforehand help restrict the number of variables.

How variables are distributed can also provide an indication of which ones to restrict. Variables that have a large number of missing values can be excluded, because imputing a large number of missing values will be suspicious to many readers due to the lack of reliable estimation, which problem may recur in applications of the model. Often, 5–20 candidate variables are sufficient to build an adequate prediction model. Nevertheless, care must be taken in restricting variables, as one drawback is that certain variables and their effects may be excluded from the prediction model.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^c2a4e5eb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions on SABV in preclinical lung disease research — females and males have variable manifestations of major acute and chronic lung diseases across the life course, and study designs need to include experimental approaches that support the disaggregation of data by sex and investigate the role of sex chromosomes and gonadal influences. Preclinical and in vitro models of lung diseases have been critical for understanding pathophysiology, but modeling sex differences in pulmonary processes has lagged and lacked rigor, and careful study design focused on powered analyses in a 2 × 2 factorial design may yield the most detailed data to address outcomes between treated vs. controls, males vs. females, and interactions between biological sex and interventions. This research statement has provided support that SABV needs to be considered in preclinical and cellular models of lung diseases, and standardized approaches to experimental design and reporting of sex differences are integral for accelerating the discovery for all pulmonary diseases.

### Prediction versus aetiology: common pitfalls and how to avoid them [^b12dd23e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Prediction research is a distinct field of epidemiologic research, which should be clearly separated from aetiological research. Both prediction and aetiology make use of multivariable modelling, but the underlying research aim and interpretation of results are very different. Aetiology aims at uncovering the causal effect of a specific risk factor on an outcome, adjusting for confounding factors that are selected based on pre-existing knowledge of causal relations. In contrast, prediction aims at accurately predicting the risk of an outcome using multiple predictors collectively, where the final prediction model is usually based on statistically significant, but not necessarily causal, associations in the data at hand. In both scientific and clinical practice, however, the two are often confused, resulting in poor-quality publications with limited interpretability and applicability. A major problem is the frequently encountered aetiological interpretation of prediction results, where individual variables in a prediction model are attributed causal meaning. This article stresses the differences in use and interpretation of aetiological and prediction studies, and gives examples of common pitfalls.

### Avoiding systematic bias in orthopedics research through informed variable selection: a discussion of confounders, mediators, and colliders [^0c83cdae]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

There are 3 common variable types in orthopedic research-confounders, colliders, and mediators. All 3 types of variables are associated with both the exposure (eg, surgery type, implant type, body mass index) and outcome (eg, complications, revision surgery) but differ in their temporal ordering. To reduce systematic bias, the decision to include or exclude a variable in an analysis should be based on the variable's relationship with the exposure and outcome for each research question. In this article, we define 3 types of variables with case examples from orthopedic research. Please visit the followinghttps://youtu.be/V-grpgB1ShQfor videos that explain the highlights of the article in practical terms.

### Response variability to analgesics: a role for non-specific activation of endogenous opioids [^f15067c9]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Individual differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the type of pain and the method of drug administration can account for the response variability to analgesics. By integrating a clinical and an experimental approach, we report here that another important source of variability is represented by individual differences in non-specific (placebo) activation of endogenous opioid systems. In the first part of this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of buprenorphine, tramadol, ketorolac and metamizol in the clinical setting, where the placebo effect was completely eliminated by means of hidden infusions. We found that the hidden injections were significantly less effective and less variable compared with open injections (in full view of the subject), suggesting that part of the response variability was due to non-specific factors (placebo). Since we could not administer the opioid antagonist, naloxone, to these patients, in the second part of this study, we induced experimental ischemic arm pain in healthy volunteers and found that, as occurred in clinical pain, the analgesic response to a hidden injection of the non-opioid ketorolac was less effective and less variable than an open injection. Most importantly, we obtained the same effects by adding naloxone to an open injection of ketorolac, thus blocking the opioid-mediated placebo component of analgesia. These findings indicate that both the psychological (hidden injection) and pharmacological (naloxone) blockade of the placebo response reduce the effectiveness of, and the response variability to, analgesic drugs. Therefore, an important source of response variability to analgesics appears to be due to differences in non-specific activation of endogenous opioid systems.

Nonoptimal networks balance periods of stability and instability.

a, A linear subsystem of active neurons can be tuned to encode a continuum of orientations over a fixed interval (heatmap; left). Multiple line attractors can be stitched together at orientations where the active subset simultaneously gains and loses an active neuron (middle), thereby generating a ring attractor (right). b, Without precise tuning, each linear subsystem (shaded region; left) encodes a single unstable or stable fixed point ('FP'; markers). When stitched together (middle), the set of linear subsystems can stably encode only a finite number of orientations ('point attractors'; right). c, Top: the dynamics of each linear subsystem are governed by the leading eigenvalue λ of the active submatrix of the connectivity (Fig. 2h). Bottom: in the unstable regime (orange), the bump accelerates away from an unstable fixed point at rate λ u > 0; in the stable regime (turquoise), the bump decelerates toward a stable fixed point at rate λ s < 0. d, Bump dynamics depend on the fixed-point orientations (square markers), drift rates λ (color map), and angular span of each regime (colored areas).

### To adjust or not to adjust: the role of different covariates in cardiovascular observational studies [^ea31ea0d]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Covariate adjustment is integral to the validity of observational studies assessing causal effects. It is common practice to adjust for as many variables as possible in observational studies in the hopes of reducing confounding by other variables. However, indiscriminate adjustment for variables using standard regression models may actually lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we differentiate between confounders, mediators, colliders, and effect modifiers. We will discuss that while confounders should be adjusted for in the analysis, one should be wary of adjusting for colliders. Mediators should not be adjusted for when examining the total effect of an exposure on an outcome. Automated statistical programs should not be used to decide which variables to include in causal models. Using a case scenario in cardiology, we will demonstrate how to identify confounders, colliders, mediators and effect modifiers and the implications of adjustment or non-adjustment for each of them.

### Estimating causal effects from epidemiological data [^b780186d]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2006). Low credibility.

In ideal randomised experiments, association is causation: association measures can be interpreted as effect measures because randomisation ensures that the exposed and the unexposed are exchangeable. On the other hand, in observational studies, association is not generally causation: association measures cannot be interpreted as effect measures because the exposed and the unexposed are not generally exchangeable. However, observational research is often the only alternative for causal inference. This article reviews a condition that permits the estimation of causal effects from observational data, and two methods — standardisation and inverse probability weighting — to estimate population causal effects under that condition. For simplicity, the main description is restricted to dichotomous variables and assumes that no random error attributable to sampling variability exists. The appendix provides a generalisation of inverse probability weighting.

### Regression: understanding what covariates and confounds Do in adjusted analyses [^204cc71f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of regression analysis is common in research. This article presents an introductory section that explains basic terms and concepts such as independent and dependent variables (IVs and DVs), covariates and confounds, zero-order correlations and multiple correlations, variance explained by variables and shared variance, bivariate and multivariable linear regression, line of least squares and residuals, unadjusted and adjusted analyses, unstandardized (b) and standardized (β) coefficients, adjusted R², interaction terms, and others. Next, this article presents a more advanced section with the help of 3 examples; the raw data files for these examples are included in supplementary materials, and readers are encouraged to download the data files and run the regressions on their own in order to better follow what is explained in the text (this, however, is not mandatory, and readers who do not do so can also follow the discussions in the text). The 3 examples illustrate many points. When important covariates are not included in regressions, the included IVs explain a smaller proportion of the variance in the DV, and the relationships between the included IVs and the DV may not be correctly understood. Including interaction terms between IVs can improve the explanatory value of the model whether the IVs are intercorrelated or not. When IVs are intercorrelated (such as when one is a confound), although their net effect in multivariable regression may explain a greater proportion of the variance in the DV, their individual b and β coefficients decrease in proportion to the shared variance that is removed. Thus, variables that were found statistically significant in unadjusted analyses may lose statistical significance in fully adjusted analyses. Readers may find it useful to keep these points in mind when running regressions on their data or when reading studies that present their results through regressions.

ACOEM methodology — baseline comparability measures how well the baseline groups are comparable (e.g., age, gender, prior treatment) and defines scoring criteria: Ratings include a combined assessment for both demographic and outcomes variables. Statistical significance does not need to be present for baseline comparability dissimilarity; a score of "0" may apply if a characteristic(s) or outcome variable(s) difference is likely to affect the study conclusions. Rating is "0" if analyses show that the groups were dissimilar at baseline or it cannot be assessed, and a score of "0" may occur if the baseline comparability is too sparse or key elements are not included pre-intervention. Rating is "0.5" if there is general comparability, though one variable may not be comparable, and a rating of 0.5 should not be given if that variable is a key outcome variable. Rating is "1.0" if there is good comparability for all demographic and outcome variables between the groups at baseline.

### Optimizing bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy: consensus recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^af5477c5]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Variability in bowel preparation adequacy and denominator definition — This introduces another source of variability because endoscopists may have different thresholds for considering a bowel preparation adequate and expend different degrees of effort in intraprocedural washing, and in one retrospective study of ambulatory colonoscopies performed by 11 endoscopists at a university medical center, the frequency of "poor/unsatisfactory" or "fair" bowel preparations ranged from 3% to 40% with a mean value of 22%. For calculation of adequacy rates, individuals whose colonoscopies are cancelled for presumed inadequate preparation (i.e., before colonoscope insertion) should be included when calculating both endoscopy unit and endoscopist-level bowel preparation adequacy rates, and when significant variability in bowel preparation adequacy is seen between endoscopists in a practice with shared preparation processes, it suggests individual-level variation in either intraprocedural efforts at augmenting bowel preparation quality or in their assessment of adequacy.

### Variable selection strategies and its importance in clinical prediction modelling [^c1ede5cb]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

The stepwise selection method is perhaps the most widely used method of variable selection. One reason is that it is easy to apply in statistical software. This method allows researchers to examine models with different combinations of variables that otherwise may be overlooked. The method is also comparatively objective as the same variables are generally selected from the same data set even though different persons are conducting the analysis. This helps reproduce the results and validate in model. There are also disadvantages to using the stepwise selection method. There is instability of variable selection if a different sample is used; however, a large effective sample size (50 events per variable) can help overcome this issue. The p values obtained by this method are also in doubt, as so many multiple tests occur during the selection process. If there are too many candidate variables, then the method fails to provide the best model, as some irrelevant variables are entered into the model. The regression coefficients obtained by this method are also biased. It also prevents researchers from thinking about the problem. There is also criticism that stepwise and other automated variable selection processes can generate biologically implausible models. Collinearity is often considered a serious issue in stepwise variable selection. Variables that best describe a particular data set are chosen by the stepwise procedure due to their high-magnitude coefficients for that data set, not necessarily for the underlying population. If there are two highly correlated variables and they contribute equally to the outcome, there is a good chance that both of the correlated variables will be out of the model in stepwise selection if they are individually less significant than other non-correlated variables. Conversely, if one of the two correlated variables contributes substantially better to the outcome for a particular data set and thus appears in the model, the estimate of its coefficient can be much higher in magnitude than its true population value. Additionally, potential valuable information from its correlated variable can be lost and the results less generalisable.

### Variability of risk factors and diabetes complications [^b21c241c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In most of the intervention studies in settings of T2D, a reduction in the magnitude of diverse CV risk factors have translated into tangible benefits on hard endpoints. On the other side, no trial has clearly proven that a reduction in variability per se, independently of the risk factor magnitude, is beneficial. However, evidence is growing suggesting that the variability of a risk factor might be not less dangerous than its magnitude and/or the time spent having it in an abnormal level. Moreover, it is also enough clear that the variability of each factor is additive in leading to the final picture of a diabetic complication. Therefore, from a therapeutic viewpoint, is it time to try to reduce both magnitude and variability of CV risk factors? Because an improvement of the quality of care and the attainment of their target seem to be the best strategy to reach this goal, we believe that the answer is not complicated.

Statistical design, analysis, and reporting for SABV in preclinical in vitro studies emphasize power analysis and transparent sex-based planning: researchers "should determine minimum group sizes and sex allocations based on primary outcomes and effect sizes from preliminary studies". "Ideally, an equal number of male and female biological replicates should be used; at a minimum, the sex of biological replicates should be recorded a priori". "Preliminary findings can guide the two-way ANOVA to assess sex as an independent variable and its interaction with other factors", and "incorporating existing sample sizes and power analyses will aid in designing future studies focused on sex differences". Reporting expectations include that "reporting effect size, statistical power, and predicted sample sizes for each sex is essential for accurately calculating the necessary sample size to examine SABV (190)". For powering sex effects, "sample sizes must be calculated separately for each sex and then combined, accounting for sex differences in disease incidence and effect size", and "the ideal study design for evaluating sex differences should be powered to detect statistically significant sex-by-treatment interactions", noting "such a study requires a larger sample size than one designed solely to detect the main effect or sex alone (191)". When sex differences are not the primary focus and sizing is uncertain, investigators can follow "The Four C's of Studying Sex to Strengthen Science": "1) Consider — design studies that account for sex or justify its exclusion; 2) Collect — gather sex-based data; 3) Characterize — analyze sex-specific data; and 4) Communicate — report and publish".

### Effect of variable selection strategy on the performance of prognostic models when using multiple imputation [^95f2331f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2019). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of missing data is an important issue when using clinical data. Missing data occur when some variables are only measured on a subset of the subjects. Rubin developed a framework for addressing missing data. The framework is easiest to describe for a single incomplete variable. Data are said to be missing completely at random if the probability that a given variable is missing for a specific subject is unrelated to the value of that variable or of any other variable. Data are said to be missing at random if the probability that a given variable is missing for a specific subject is unrelated to the value of that variable, conditional on the observed values of other variables. Finally, data are said to be missing not at random if the probability that a given variable is missing for a specific subject is related to the value of that variable itself, conditional on the observed values of other variables. Developing a prognostic model using only subjects with complete data (ie, excluding those subjects with any missing data) can have at least 2 possible adverse consequences. First, the estimated standard errors for the regression coefficients would be unnecessarily large, as information would be lost by excluding subjects with any missing data. Second, if the data were missing at random and not missing completely at random, then the estimated regression coefficients could be biased. To address the problems presented by missing data, Rubin developed multiple imputation, which entails the creation of M (M > 1) copies of the original sample in which missing data have been filled-in using a model for the missing data. Each of the M imputed datasets is complete, in that missing data are not present. In each of the M imputed datasets, a conventional statistical analysis is conducted. Estimated regression coefficients and their standard errors can be combined using Rubin's Rules, which account for both within- and between-imputation variability.

### Understanding variability: the role of meta-analysis of variance [^a5ed2088]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses traditionally compare the difference in means between groups for one or more outcomes of interest. However, they do not compare the spread of data (variability), which could mean that important effects and/or subgroups are missed. To address this, methods to compare variability meta-analytically have recently been developed, making it timely to review them and consider their strengths, weaknesses, and implementation. Using published data from trials in major depression, we demonstrate how the spread of data can impact both overall effect size and the frequency of extreme observations within studies, with potentially important implications for conclusions of meta-analyses, such as the clinical significance of findings. We then describe two methods for assessing group differences in variability meta-analytically: the variance ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). We consider the reporting and interpretation of these measures and how they differ from the assessment of heterogeneity between studies. We propose general benchmarks as a guideline for interpreting VR and CVR effects as small, medium, or large. Finally, we discuss some important limitations and practical considerations of VR and CVR and consider the value of integrating variability measures into meta-analyses.

### Variability of risk factors and diabetes complications [^1560eda4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest that, together with glucose variability, the variability of other risk factors, as blood pressure, plasma lipids, heart rate, body weight, and serum uric acid, might play a role in the development of diabetes complications. Moreover, the variability of each risk factor, when contemporarily present, may have additive effects. However, the question is whether variability is causal or a marker. Evidence shows that the quality of care and the attainment of the target impact on the variability of all risk factors. On the other hand, for some of them causality may be considered. Although specific studies are still lacking, it should be useful checking the variability of a risk factor, together with its magnitude out of the normal range, in clinical practice. This can lead to an improvement of the quality of care, which, in turn, could further hesitate in an improvement of risk factors variability.

### Deviation from the matching law reflects an optimal strategy involving learning over multiple timescales [^6b21e0b7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In a changing world, animals have to make decisions that are based on the limited information they can extract from the environment. Models of reinforcement learning and other learning theories assume that subjects' belief about the environment is gradually updated based on the history of choices and outcomes –. The optimal strategy for updating beliefs is to weigh past experiences according to the degree of uncertainty, or volatility, of the environment –. If the environment is stable, it is beneficial to consider a large number of past experiences to estimate the current state more accurately. In volatile environments, only a small number of recent experiences should be considered, as old ones may no longer be informative about the current situation.

Previous studies into flexible reward learning have largely focused on how animals can adjust their learning rate according to the volatility of the environment. Many of these studies have assumed that a single time constant (learning rate) is continuously modified over time (see e.g. refs.). Real world environments, however, can change on multiple timescales and learning on multiple timescales can be highly beneficial computationally. Here we analyzed an experiment to identify integration processes that operate on multiple timescales. We show that these processes cooperate to maximize the subjects' reward harvesting performance in a volatile environment. Interestingly, the subjects deviate from the behavior that would be optimal in a stationary environment. However, rather than a failure, this deviation reflects an adaptive strategy that is more efficient in volatile environments.

In the experiment, monkeys were trained to perform a dynamic foraging taskin which they track the changing reward rates of alternative choices through time. The reward rates changed periodically without any warning. Within each period during which the reward contingencies were kept constant, the probabilistic strategy that maximizes subjects' cumulative reward is to follow the so-called matching law, under a specific reward schedule that is often referred to as the concurrent variable-interval schedule.

According to the matching law, subjects distribute their choices across available options in the same proportion as the rewards obtained from those options. This type of behavior has been observed across a wide range of species including pigeons, rats, monkeys, and humans. Although the matching law provides a simple and elegant description of behavior, actual choice often deviates from matching.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder discontinuation and maintenance guidance states that successful medication treatment should be continued for 1–2 years before considering a gradual taper by decrements of 10%–25% every 1–2 months while observing for symptom return or exacerbation [I]. Successful exposure and response prevention (ERP) should be followed by monthly booster sessions for 3–6 months, or more intensively if response has been only partial [II]. Given variability across discontinuation trials, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended [III], and the data suggest that CBT consisting of ERP may have more durable effects than some SRIs after discontinuation, although observed differences in relapse rates could be explained by other factors.

### Clarifying the causes of consistent and inconsistent findings in genetics [^31a8bd8a]. Genetic Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

3 INTERACTIONS AND EFFECT MODIFICATIONS

Differences in the causal effects of a genetic variant across populations may also result from other differences, such as epistatic or environmental factors which interact with or modify the effect of the variant. Understanding these factors can reveal mechanisms underlying traits, and variables that can be manipulated to affect outcomes.

In a causal interaction, an outcome is affected by two variables acting together: the effect of one variable on the outcome depends on the second variable, and conversely, the effect of the second variable on the outcome depends on the first variable. Each variable also has its own independent causal effect on the outcome. Additive interactions can be estimated by comparing the joint effect of both the variables in combination to the sum of the individual effects of the two variables in isolation. Effects of interactions are greater (or smaller) than the sum of effects of the two variables. In contrast, multiplicative interactions can be estimated by comparing the joint effect of both the variables in combination to the product of the individual effects of the two variables in isolation (Bours; VanderWeele).

In a causal effect modification, a second variable modifies the effect of the first variable on the outcome. This concept is asymmetrical because the second variable may not have an independent causal effect on the outcome (averaging over the possible values of the first variable). Effect modifications can be estimated by comparing the effect of one variable on the outcome in the presence of the second variable versus in its absence (Bours; VanderWeele). If the prevalence of this second variable varies between populations, this can result in differences in the observed effect size of an exposure on an outcome.

### Learning mechanisms in nocebo hyperalgesia: the role of conditioning and extinction processes [^a3b5944d]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

It has been demonstrated that negative expectations regarding treatment outcomes may aggravate pain symptoms, a phenomenon termed nocebo hyperalgesia. In experimental research, nocebo hyperalgesia is defined as a significant increase in pain after a nocebo treatment, relative to no-treatment or a control treatment. Negative expectations may enhance aversive side effectsor produce deleterious effects on pain recovery. Classical conditioning is an important underlying mechanism of nocebo hyperalgesia. In conditioning paradigms, the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (eg, an inert treatment) with an unconditioned stimulus (eg, surreptitiously increased pain) leads to a learned association. As a result of this learned association, an inert treatment can evoke increases in perceived pain.

Most nocebo studies induce hyperalgesia by use of conditioning with continuous reinforcement (CRF) (100% pairing of conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus). In a more ambiguous type of conditioning with partial reinforcement (PRF), stimuli are paired in less than 100% of trials; thus, the contingency between pain and an inert nocebo treatment is more variable. Partial reinforcement is of particular clinical interest due to its variable nature, which resembles the more ambiguous and inconsistent learning that may occur in clinical settings. Partial reinforcement conditioning has been successfully used in fear researchand was recently also implemented in nocebo research. Colagiuri et al.compared continuous and PRF schedules and found that nocebo hyperalgesia can be induced through PRF. In addition, Colagiuri et al.investigated the consistent finding from fear studies that PRF conditioning shows more resistance to extinction than CRF. In contrast to findings in other fields of research, extinction was unsuccessful in attenuating nocebo hyperalgesia irrespective of the conditioning schedule. This indicated that, once established, nocebo hyperalgesia may be especially resistant to extinction, a relevant finding for chronic pain conditions, where learned effects may persist and not become extinct.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^90e204af]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Cyclosporine A monitoring — absorption variability and assay choice inform targets and scheduling. Cyclosporine A absorption may increase substantially during the first 1–2 weeks after transplantation, with absorption stabilizing by approximately the end of the first month. There are few RCTs to define optimal target blood levels, and it may be prudent to use lower early posttransplant target blood levels when an induction antibody is used. Cyclosporine A C0 has often been used for therapeutic drug monitoring, but C0 does not correlate closely with AUC0–4; blood levels at 2 h after drug administration (C2), instead of at 12 h (C0 if the dosing interval is 12 h), have been used. Although C2 levels appear to correlate more closely with AUC0–4, no differences have been observed in two RCTs between the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss or adverse events whether patients were monitored by AUC0–4 or C2 or C0 levels; therefore, either C0 or C2 blood levels are acceptable. The C0 is the measured concentration after the dosing interval (e.g. 12 h after dosing if the dosing interval is every 12 h), C2 the concentration 2 h after dosing and AUC0–4 is the AUC during the first 4 h after dosing. There are no studies comparing one schedule of monitoring vs. another; however, tailoring the monitoring schedule to the expected absorption variability is a reasonable, empirical approach. There are no data to suggest whether monitoring blood levels in stable patients beyond the first few weeks after transplantation is beneficial.

### Minor functional deficits in basic response patterns for reinforcement after frontal traumatic brain injury in rats [^a7a7a5f3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major contributor to numerous psychiatric conditions and chronic behavioral dysfunction. Recent studies in experimental brain injury have begun to adopt operant methodologies to assess these deficits, all of which rely on the process of reinforcement. No studies have directly examined how reinforced behaviors are affected by TBI, however. The current study assessed performance under the four most common schedules of reinforcement (fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, variable interval) and one higher order schedule assessing motivation (progressive ratio) after bilateral, pre-frontal controlled cortical impact injury. TBI-induced differences on the basic schedules were minor, with the exception of the variable ratio, where increased efficacy (more reinforcers, higher response rates, lower interresponse times) at higher requirements was observed as a result of brain injury. Performance on the progressive ratio schedule showed some gross differences between the groups, in that sham rats became more efficient under this schedule while injured rats perseverated in lever pressing. Further, injured rats were specifically impaired at lower response requirements on the progressive ratio. Taken together, these findings indicate that simple reinforced behaviors are mostly unaffected after TBI, except in the case of variable ratio schedules, but the altered performance on the higher-order progressive ratio schedule suggests changes involving motivation or potentially perseveration. These findings validate operant measures of more complex behaviors for brain injury, all of which rely on reinforcement and can be taken into consideration when adapting and developing novel functional assessments.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnosis (JAK2 rearrangement), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that chronic myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia, including myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia, is the characteristic clinical presentation. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia or de novo acute myeloid leukemia have also been observed. This entity predominantly affects males and is generally associated with an aggressive clinical course, with rapid progression from chronic phase disease to blast phase or secondary acute leukemia. The presence of eosinophilia is more variable for BCR::JAK2 and ETV6::JAK2 variants.

### Factors associated with a history of critical wandering among medic-alert subscribers [^54ab906f]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Operationalization of variables

Table 2 in supplemental material shows the operationalization used in the statistical model. The coding of the variables was completed by the authors. Dichotomous variables were coded as "0" or "1" (e.g. Medic-Alert subscriber's sex at birth) and each polytomous variable (e.g. Medic-Alert subscriber's ethnic background) was represented by a set of binary codes whose values codified each category variables. Concerning the outcome measure of interest in this study, namely a history of critical wandering, we dichotomized it as follows: a history of critical wandering coded as "never" was assigned a code of "0" (i.e. No); a history of critical wandering coded as "1–4 times" or "more than 4 times" was assigned a code of "1" (i.e. Yes).

### Pathways to the persistence of drug use despite its adverse consequences [^74fbd6cc]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

This work has identified at least five features of insensitivity to adverse consequences. First, when low to moderate intensity punishers are used, only some mice and rats are insensitive, speaking to individual variability in humans. Second, factors relating to initial drug use, including preference, intake, and rate of self-administration, are unrelated to insensitivity. This shows that insensitivity is separate to mechanisms governing initial use. Third, extended self-administration and longer access per self-administration session favor insensitivity. Fourth, propensity to drug seek under progressive ratio schedules, increased responding during extinction or increased economic demand can predict insensitivity (but see). Fifth, response impulsivity, such as reduced ability to wait before performing an appropriate response can predict insensitivity. These features are robust and replicable. They are important because they speak to, and constrain, mechanisms for insensitivity. We draw on these features when considering properties of the three putative pathways to insensitity to adverse consequences.

### Nicotine withdrawal in humans and rats… [^011b1542]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

For some of the correct trials, the participant received monetary reinforcement. Unbeknownst to the participants, the reinforcement schedule was designed to favor 1 mouth length over the other in a 3: 1 ratio. Only 40 correct trials were rewarded in each block. Accuracy and reaction time in response to the rich and lean stimuli represented additional secondary behavioral variables. B, Rats were food restricted and trained to discriminate between 2 tones varying in duration by pressing 1 of the 2 levers associated with each tone. During a subsequent test session, the ambiguous tone durations were reinforced for 60% and 20% of correct responses over 100 trials, which is identical to the 3: 1 reinforcement ratio used in the human Response Bias Probabilistic Reward Task.

30 Response bias, the primary variable, as well as the 3 secondary behavioral variables, were computed using identical formulae as for the human experimental data. Unbeknownst to them, throughout the test session, correct identification of 1 stimulus is rewarded 3 times more frequently than correct identification of the other stimulus. Because of the differential reinforcement schedule, healthy rats and humans develop a response bias in favor of the more frequently rewarded stimulus. The RB-PRT was administered to quantify reward responsiveness. Response bias, discriminability, accuracy and reaction time for each stimulus type were calculated. There was also a main effect of block due to significantly higher response bias in block 3 relative to block 1 and block 2, indicating that the differential reinforcement schedule was effective.

### Sources of variation and bias in studies of diagnostic accuracy: a systematic review [^036775b1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of diagnostic accuracy are subject to different sources of bias and variation than studies that evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. Little is known about the effects of these sources of bias and variation.

Purpose

To summarize the evidence on factors that can lead to bias or variation in the results of diagnostic accuracy studies.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS, and the methodologic databases of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration. Methodologic experts in diagnostic tests were contacted.

Study Selection

Studies that investigated the effects of bias and variation on measures of test performance were eligible for inclusion, which was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

The best-documented effects of bias and variation were found for demographic features, disease prevalence and severity, partial verification bias, clinical review bias, and observer and instrument variation. For other sources, such as distorted selection of participants, absent or inappropriate reference standard, differential verification bias, and review bias, the amount of evidence was limited. Evidence was lacking for other features, including incorporation bias, treatment paradox, arbitrary choice of threshold value, and dropouts.

Conclusions

Many issues in the design and conduct of diagnostic accuracy studies can lead to bias or variation; however, the empirical evidence about the size and effect of these issues is limited.

### Abstract representations emerge naturally in neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks [^2d80df57]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Humans and other animals demonstrate a remarkable ability to generalize knowledge across distinct contexts and objects during natural behavior. We posit that this ability to generalize arises from a specific representational geometry, that we call abstract and that is referred to as disentangled in machine learning. These abstract representations have been observed in recent neurophysiological studies. However, it is unknown how they emerge. Here, using feedforward neural networks, we demonstrate that the learning of multiple tasks causes abstract representations to emerge, using both supervised and reinforcement learning. We show that these abstract representations enable few-sample learning and reliable generalization on novel tasks. We conclude that abstract representations of sensory and cognitive variables may emerge from the multiple behaviors that animals exhibit in the natural world, and, as a consequence, could be pervasive in high-level brain regions. We also make several specific predictions about which variables will be represented abstractly.

### Repeated measures designs and analysis of longitudinal data: If at first you Do not succeed-try, try again [^bab96462]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Second, researchers may be interested in comparing groups on the trends over time in the outcome, and thus include time as a continuous variable. In a mixed-effect model, each subject's deviation from the mean slope and the beginning point (the intercept) can be modeled using a random intercept and random slope model, as detailed below.

Thus, in a mixed-effects model, one can (1) model the within-subject correlation in which one specifies the correlation structure for the repeated measurements within a subject (eg, autoregressive or unstructured) and/or (2) control for differences between individuals by allowing each individual to have its own regression line (Figure 4). By accounting for the fact that some individuals have consistently higher (or lower) values than others — by allowing for an individual intercept — a mixed-effect model controls for this source of variation. Likewise, individual slopes can be included in the model to control for the fact that individual responses over time differ among subjects (Figure 4).

Figure 4.
Simple example with only 1 explanatory variable (time as continuous covariate) to illustrate how linear regression assuming independent measurements differs from a mixed linear model. A, All data points are assumed to be independent. The solid line represents the regression line of the relationship between time and a hypothetical outcome measure. The difference (vertical distance) between each point and the regression line is termed residual, and the assumption of independence that we have rather informally stated in the text actually refers to independence of the residuals. As can be seen, the line does not seem to fit the data points very well, and the variance of the residuals seems to increase over time, violating a key assumption of linear regression. B, It can be see that the different data points in (A) are not independent but actually come from 4 subjects (represented by 4 different symbols and colors), measured at hourly intervals. The black line still represents the mean change in the dataset. However, by allowing each subject to have its own intercept and slope, the between-subject variability is now accounted for. The residuals are now much smaller as they represent the within-subject variability, ie, the difference of each data point from the regression line of the same subject. This allows for a more precise estimate of the subject-specific effect of time.

### Explaining inter-individual variability in phenotype: is epigenetics up to the challenge? [^c9f8649d]. Epigenetics (2010). Low credibility.

The hypothesis that environmental factors alter somatically heritable epigenetic marks and change long-term patterns of gene expression is an exciting possibility in human disease research. Because most common diseases, and many quantitative traits, are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, environmentally induced changes in epigenetic structures can provide a mechanistic link between genes and environment. We believe that inter-individual differences in the epigenetic modification of genes will explain a much greater fraction of inter-individual phenotypic variation than differences in genotype, alone.

### Behavior engineering using quantitative reinforcement learning models [^3d74a3d5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As described above, the model is characterized by four free parameters (one for each mode:). The parameters of the model were estimated from behavior, and these estimations were used in all simulations:

Schedule optimization

The schedule optimization algorithm we utilized is described by Dan & Loewenstein. For completeness, we provide its description here. Note that this method is not guaranteed to find a global optimum, nor to converge to the same solution in independent applications.

To find a reward schedule that attains a high bias given a specific model, we employed an iterative optimization. In the first iteration, an initial sequenceis generated by randomly shuffling, independently for the two alternatives, a sequence that complies with the sequence constraints (rewards are assigned to 25 of the experiment's 100 trials). In the'th iteration, a partially reshuffled sequenceis generated from the current sequenceby choosingindices, with uniform probability without replacement, independently for the two alternatives, and randomly reshuffling the rewards assigned to the trials of these indices. The resulting scheduleis testedtimes (equivalent toindependent participants) and compared to the bias previously obtained for the unshuffled schedule. This procedure is repeatedtimes and the schedule used for the subsequent iteration is the one that yields the largest bias out of thetested schedules (shuffled schedules in addition to the original schedule). The variable, which represents the 'temperature' of the algorithm, progressively decreased to zero, such that, wherewhere A, B are parameters. The parameters we used for this procedure are A = 10,000, B = 100, N = 500, m = 10. Finally, we note that the reward of the last trial cannot change behavior. Hence, it is never advantageous to allocate a reward to the last trial of Alternative 1. If the stochastic optimization converges to a solution that does not meet this criterion, the reward schedule of Alternative 1 is modified to conform with this heuristic by reallocating the reward of the last trial to a random trial currently not associated with a reward. Similarly, if a reward is not assigned to the last trial of Alternative 2, one of the rewards associated with that alternative is randomly chosen and reallocated to the last trial. Due to the stochastic nature of this optimization, we repeated the complete proceduretimes and chose the schedule that yielded the maximal bias.

### Multiple timescales of normalized value coding underlie adaptive choice behavior [^663de88c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Block of trials were presented that were composed of a mixture of adapter trials and test trials. Trial composition was assigned to be 60% adapter trials and 40% test trials, with individual trial identity determined randomly. In test trials, fixed in structure across all blocks, monkey chose between an unvarying reference reward (fixed reward magnitude and juice type) and one of the five variable rewards (Fig. 2b). These responses allowed us to plot the monkey's probability of choosing the reference reward as a function of the magnitude of the variable reward: a choice curve. What we systematically varied across blocks was the structure of the adapter trials. The structure was comprised of a narrow versus a wide standard deviation in the magnitude of randomly presented adapter trial options. We then examined the effects of the standard deviation of adapter variability on the slopes of these choice curves. Monkeys were required to complete both condition blocks within a single session. Thus, on a given testing day, animals were required to complete both one wide and one narrow block. Block order was randomized over recording days. Only days in which monkeys performed > 230 trials per block correctly were included in the analysis. On average, animals performed 289 trials per block leading to an average of total of 578 trials per daily session. An additional accuracy criterion of 80% correct trials was used for data inclusion. A total of 9 days of data collection had to be discarded from analysis of which 5 days were due to poor animal performance (below 80%) and 4 days due to equipment failure. The average accuracy over both animals was 85%. Switches between blocks within a testing day were not overtly signaled to the animal. However, we note that, since offer quantities were unique between blocks, it is possible that the animal could identify block changes from this indirect signal.

3.2.2 The BDCoCoLasso also outperforms naïve Lasso with weakened signals, increased error rate, and increased dimensionality

In the lower‐dimensional setting (and), when the magnitude of causal feature effect sizes was reduced, and more causal features were introduced, the estimation accuracy and stability for the naïve Lasso decreased substantially (Figures 2 and S3). In contrast, although an increase in the number of causal features and the correlation between features rendered the signals more elusive and resulted in an increase in FPR and a decrease in sparsity, the BDCoCoLasso always maintained better estimation accuracy than the naïve Lasso with better consistency across replicates (Figures 2 and S3). Also as expected, the BDCoCoLasso was clearly less sensitive to changes in the proportion of features measured with error (Figure 2). Such an improved estimation accuracy persisted when the covariate matrix contained more features (or; Figures 3 and S4).

### Constipation and high blood pressure variability [^4ea59536]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Defecation status and blood pressure variability. The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in regulating both blood pressure (BP) variability and bowel movement. The association of elevated BP variability and constipation, shown in this study, may be indicative of autonomic dysfunction involved in gut-vascular axis

In considering the influence on blood pressure variability and defecation status, it is essential to note that several classes of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, β-adrenoceptor antagonists, and diuretics, can lead to constipation as an adverse effect. Moreover, antihypertensive medication can impact the degree of blood pressure variability. Importantly, poor adherence to prescribed medication considerably contributes to increased day-to-day blood pressure variability. However, in the present study, only 10% of the subjects were prescribed antihypertensive agents. Furthermore, among the group of individuals not taking antihypertensive medications, no daily bowel movement status demonstrated an association with blood pressure variability. Thus, in the present data set, clinical characteristics of the subjects may play a more important role in blood pressure variability than the use of antihypertensive drugs. These findings underscore the intriguing relationship between constipation and elevated blood pressure variability, presumably linked to dysregulated autonomous nerve functions.

Since this study is observational, a causal relationship between constipation and elevated blood pressure variability cannot be established. Nevertheless, if infrequent bowel movements can be improved, it may be possible that blood pressure variability might also improve. Consequently, therapeutic interventions aimed at improving defecation status through the use of laxatives or lifestyle interventions may hold the potential to stabilize blood pressure variability, potentially reducing the future risk of cardiovascular events and hypertensive organ damage. Further studies are warranted to determine whether interventions, including medication and lifestyle modifications against constipation, can ameliorate the intestinal environment and reduce blood pressure variability via gut-vascular axis.

### Translational opportunities in animal and human models to study alcohol use disorder [^707ba1bf]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Depicts rodent and human paradigms and outcome measurement for the acquisition of operant self-administration and progressive ratio self-administration.

Rodents acquire operant self-administration through the pairing of an active level press with access to an ethanol solution. Over time, rodents learn to acquire this self-administration behavior. Currently, there is no human paradigm which parallels the acquisition of self-administration. In the rodent and human progressive self-administration, the response requirement to obtain an alcohol delivery gradually increases during the operant session. The maximum number of responses the rodent/human makes in order to receive alcohol is referred to as the break point. This type of schedule reflects an animal's motivation to obtain an alcohol delivery.

Schedule-induced polydipsia is a commonly used method to initiate operant self-administration, which uses scheduled delivery of food and alcohol reinforcement, resulting in excessive drinking. Typically, animals are food restricted to 85% of their free-feeding body weight and placed in operant chambers, requiring the animal to lever press for a food reward delivered using a variety of interval schedules (e.g. fixed interval, variable interval, fixed time), followed immediately by fluid delivery. However, more recent applications of this method of administration no longer require lever pressing for food and fluid delivery, but have pellets delivered automatically based on a fixed time interval. Alcohol concentrations are commonly increased in a stepwise manner (e.g. 0.5 g/kg, 1.0 g/kg, 1.5 g/kg) for 30 days, once a maximum concentration is reached the induction period is completed and the animals are placed under "open access" in which they have water to ethanol and water for 22 h./day with pellets still available in a fixed ratio 1 schedule. Due to the many parameters (i.e. time of day, duration of access, feeding conditions, non-flavored vs. flavored alcohol, free alcohol access vs. operant responding) that can be manipulated in this model, several variations have been implemented in an attempt to increase daily intake, such as, using multiple discrete self-administration sessions during the "open access" period, increasing the ethanol concentration at a much faster rate (i.e. every 3–7 days), and flavoring the alcohol solution.

### Multiple timescales of normalized value coding underlie adaptive choice behavior [^9165c815]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Adaptation is a fundamental process crucial for the efficient coding of sensory information. Recent evidence suggests that similar coding principles operate in decision-related brain areas, where neural value coding adapts to recent reward history. However, the circuit mechanism for value adaptation is unknown, and the link between changes in adaptive value coding and choice behavior is unclear. Here we show that choice behavior in nonhuman primates varies with the statistics of recent rewards. Consistent with efficient coding theory, decision-making shows increased choice sensitivity in lower variance reward environments. Both the average adaptation effect and across-session variability are explained by a novel multiple timescale dynamical model of value representation implementing divisive normalization. The model predicts empirical variance-driven changes in behavior despite having no explicit knowledge of environmental statistics, suggesting that distributional characteristics can be captured by dynamic model architectures. These findings highlight the importance of treating decision-making as a dynamic process and the role of normalization as a unifying computation for contextual phenomena in choice.

### Myeloid / lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusion genes, version 3.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^98e606f0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to next-generation sequencing, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that next-generation sequencing studies have identified driver mutations involving a broad spectrum of genes most frequently involved in DNA methylation/chromatin modification. The rate of mutation detection is variable (11%, 28%, and 53% in 3 different studies) and the number of genes screened im these studies was also variable (23, 45, and 88, respectively).

### Exploring the interactions between psychotic symptoms, cognition, and environmental risk factors: a Bayesian analysis of networks [^2381de2b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Calculation of Latent Variable Scores

Why? In this study, we include childhood trauma and psychopathological symptoms by using responses to items from the CAPE and CTQ-SF. Historically, many studies have done this by calculating the sum of the scores on each item of the questionnaire. This approach is problematic because the item labels are meaningless; they are merely ordered values, and it is unclear what their summed values convey. In addition, the use of a sum score implies that there is a particular psychological construct underlying the individual item scores, a latent variable, but it does not consider the uncertainty in estimating this latent variable. Thus, using sum scores may lead to inaccurate estimates of network relations. For this reason, we decided to use a latent variable model to determine how item scores load on the latent construct and then use this latent variable model to generate plausible values, a value for an individual's unknown latent variable based on observed item responses. We use these plausible values to impute the latent variables as a node in the network model.

How? We estimated a latent variable model for ordinal response data, called the generalized partial credit model, using the R package mirtto determine how each item score relates to the latent construct. We then used the estimated parameters of the latent variable model to subsequently estimate a value for the latent variable for each participant. Specifically, we simulate a plausible value for the latent variable from its posterior distribution, which captures the uncertainty that we have about the latent variable. To account for this uncertainty, we generated 100 plausible values for each latent variable per person. More information on the details of our plausible value imputation procedure can be found in the Supplementary Material, Appendix 2.

Imputation of Missing Values

We used the R package mice, to impute missing values, using the 12 study variables, participant status (patient, sibling, or control), age, and gender as predictors in the imputation algorithm. We generated 100 completed datasets (ie, a dataset with imputed values for the missing data points and latent variables). The variability across the 100 completed datasets is thus due to the uncertainty in imputing the missing data points and latent variables. More information on the missing data and the imputation process can be found in the Supplementary Material, Appendix 3, and Tables 2 and 3.

### Accuracy prompts are a replicable and generalizable approach for reducing the spread of misinformation [^6ba570ee]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Analysis approach

For analysis purposes, sharing decisions (the dependent variable) are rescaled such that the minimum possible value is 0 (indicating a very low likelihood of sharing) and the maximum possible value is 1 (indicating a very high likelihood of sharing). Within each study, we conduct a rating-level (i.e. one observation per subject-item pair) linear regression with robust standard errors clustered on participant and headline, taking sharing intention as the dependent variable. Our main analysis includes a dummy for headline veracity (0 = false, 1 = true), a dummy for condition (0 = control, 1 = accuracy prompt), and the interaction term. With this specification, the coefficient on the interaction term indicates the accuracy prompt's effect on sharing discernment (the difference in sharing likelihood for true relative to false headlines), the coefficient on the condition dummy indicates the accuracy prompt's effect on sharing intentions for false headlines, and the coefficient on the headline veracity dummy indicates baseline sharing discernment in the control condition. Our participant-level heterogeneity analyses use models that add the individual difference being interrogated along with all interaction terms, and focus on the 3-way interaction (the extent to which the individual difference moderates the accuracy prompt's effect on sharing discernment); and our analysis of order effects adds trial number along with all interaction terms, and again focuses on the 3-way interaction.

For any given coefficient of interest, we calculate an estimate for each study. Our interest, however, is not the effect in any given study. Instead, we are interested in the best estimate of the effect using the data from all studies. Therefore, for each coefficient of interest, we combine the estimates from each study using random effects meta-analysis to generate this overall estimate – what we refer to as the "meta-analytic estimate" of the value of that coefficient. We use random effects meta-analysis, rather than fixed-effects meta-analysis, because there is reason to expect that the true effect size varies across studies (because, for example, different studies used different versions of the treatment, different headlines, and different subject pools).

### Drug memory reconsolidation: from molecular mechanisms to the clinical context [^bdf94a05]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

It is likely that the relative paucity of studies of instrumental memory reconsolidation is at least partly due to an early study in which an instrumental memory appeared not to undergo protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation following retrieval. There may also be differences in the boundary conditions determining whether instrumental memories reconsolidate, as compared to pavlovian memories. Whereas pavlovian memories are susceptible to disruption following CS-based reactivation, instrumental memories may require a 'mismatch' in the type of reinforcement contingency experienced at reactivation. A predictable reinforcement schedule (i.e. additional sessions of training) did not render an instrumental memory underlying saccharin-seeking susceptible to disruption with cycloheximide and studies investigating well-established cocaine-seeking memories in self-administering rats have indicated that a change in reinforcement schedule at reactivation, from a predictable 'fixed-ratio' schedule to a less predictable 'variable ratio' schedule of reinforcement, is required to induce susceptibility to disruption with the NMDAR antagonist MK-801, with non-reinforced memory reactivation sessions being insufficient to destabilise the instrumental memory. However, other studies of instrumental sucrose-seeking and nicotine-seeking have shown that non-reinforced memory reactivation sessions can lead to memory lability. A detailed analysis of procedural differences that may have contributed to these apparent differences in boundary conditions is considered by Piva et al. and may be related to the dose of amnestic agent administered, the potential engagement of metaplasticity mechanisms, the specific reinforcer, the strength of training, changes in reactivation context or the passage of time between learning and reactivation. It may be that a better understanding of the relationship between prior learning – which generates the expectations that determine whether a 'mismatch' or prediction error is detected – and the reactivation session itself will be necessary to resolve these apparent differences.

### Autoreservoir computing for multistep ahead prediction based on the spatiotemporal information transformation [^a2e7dd4b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

It is clear that the future states includingare obtained simultaneously by solving ARNN Eq. (3) with the observed time series of length m, which is indeed the (L − 1)-step-ahead prediction, rather than the one-step-ahead prediction. It should be noted that when we solve the ARNN equations, { y 1, …, y m } are known but { y m +1, …, y m + L −1 } are unknown future values of the target variable because of the delay embedding. Therefore, it is similar to a semi-supervised learning process. The detailed algorithm of ARNN is given in Supplementary Note 3.

Although high-dimensional data have rich information, they may also have a noisy effect on the prediction if some of the high-dimensional variables contain little information on the target variable. Thus, choosing relevant variables or eliminating irrelevant variables to the target variable from the high-dimensional data may significantly enhance the performance of ARNN in practical applications. Given a time series of n -dimensional variables, by calculating the mutual information between the time seriesand { y 1, y 2, …, y m }, we select the most correlated variables (e.g. D variables among all n variables) with the target variable y, i.e. variables with the high mutual information with y, and obtain the following input vectors and matrixwhere D is the number of the selected variables with n ≥ D, and m is the length of the known time series.

Compared with traditional neural network method, ARNN takes much less time and computing resources in decoding the intertwined information among massive variables of a complex system, for the future value prediction of the target variable. A comparison between the ARNN and traditional neural network method on the computational complexity is demonstrated in Supplementary Note 5, from which it is seen that ARNN is cost-effective and requires little computing resources comparing with other neural networks such as LSTM.

### Continuous monitoring of the lower limit of reactivity in traumatic brain injury patients: understanding what is feasible [^f92d2a74]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Ayasse et al. correctly point out that the methodology of PRx-based CA assessment requires sufficient variability in arterial blood pressure (ABP). However, they then claim that such variability is limited in patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), due to 'meticulous patient monitoring leading to accurate CPP targeting'. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between short-term and long-term variability in ABP. The variability required for PRx calculations is the latter: it is important to have enough variability (and thus power) from oscillations in the frequency range < 0.05 Hz within the 5-min data buffer used for each PRx calculations. Such variability is spontaneous and inherent to ABP, and it remains regardless of the management regime. Nonetheless, it is true that the short-term variability of ABP may sometimes not be sufficient to provide a good signal-to-noise ratio of PRx as exemplified by studies where PEEP-induced waves in ABP significantly decreased PRx variability. On the other hand, the long-term variability in ABP is under the control of the bedside clinical management. This, however, does not mean that ABP is kept stable, when viewed over hours. Furthermore, it is the combined, long-term variability of ABP and ICP, and thus CPP, that matters when attempting to trace and visualise the autoregulatory curve, required for 'optimal' CPP (CPPopt) or LLR calculations.

### Physiological and clinical variables identify ARDS classes and therapeutic heterogeneity to glucocorticoids: a retrospective study [^77a7a9a7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Latent profile analysis (LPA)

LPA is similar to latent class analysis (LCA) in that it assumes that the data contain many unobserved groups or classes and determines group heterogeneity by mixture modelling to determine the best-fit model for a set of data. When used to deal with continuous variables, it is called LPA. Potential class-based methods have been widely used in other disciplines, medicine, and related ARDS studies.

Data on continuous physiological and clinical variables in demographics, vital signs, invasive respiratory parameters, blood gas analysis parameters, and laboratory parameters were assessed as class-defining variables for LPA, excluding all categorical variables. Partially similar demographics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were used as defining variables, according to previous studies. Unlike previous studies, we also included variables not used in previous LCA studies, such as residual base, total CO2, and anion gap. All variables are easily available at the bedside. Among variables, urine volume was subjected to unit changes to reduce variance exceeding the upper limit of analytical detection, and highly correlated variables were excluded. The full set of class-defined variables used for LPA (31 continuous variables) is shown in Additional file 1. Clinical outcome variables and categorical variables were not included in the model.

### Multiple timescales of normalized value coding underlie adaptive choice behavior [^ff8b16f4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the underlying biophysical mechanism, the slow temporal dynamics evident in our behavioral results emphasizes that the brain integrates information over real time rather than discrete trials. As our permutation tests demonstrate, merely shuffling the temporal structure reduces the predictive power of our model. This establishes that the actual temporal structure, and not merely the trial order, determines how reward history is integrated into an estimate of the reward environment. This finding is additionally supported by the fact that shuffling the temporal structure has a more detrimental effect on the behavior–model correspondence in the animal that has a larger variability in their temporal trial order.

Our modeling results also emphasize the importance of treating decision-making as a dynamic rather than a stationary process and demonstrate the power of a dynamic approach for explaining variability in choice behavior. The empirical adaptation effects we observed were variable across sessions despite identical average reward statistics, suggesting that adaptation responds to local, within-block fluctuations in reward environments. This variability in strength of adaptation was captured by a dynamic normalization model whose only input was the stream of observed rewards, indicating that behaviorally driven reward adaptation does not require explicit knowledge of distributional characteristics. A crucial element of this normalization model is the existence of two timescales of operation: a fast timescale in the choice behavior circuit and a slow timescale in the circuit integrating reward information over multiple trials. This dual timescale network is consistent with recent evidence that neurons exhibit a diversity of time constants. In our data, optimal slow circuit time constants were comparable between both animals (60–75 s); however, it is possible that environmental characteristics could influence the temporal integration process.

Boxplot for the median agreement rates of variables by domain

A summary of the variables with a "perfect", "substantial", and "moderate" agreement is shown in Table 2. A total of 28 (11.2%) variables have substantial agreement (75–99.9%), and a total of 59 (23.6%) variables have moderate agreement (50–74.9%) across registries. Taken together, this means that from the total of 250 variables in all registries, 138 (55.2%) variables had less than 50% agreement across registries.

### Continuity of care in fixed-day versus variable-day resident continuity clinics [^eed5719f]. Academic Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Since the introduction of resident work-hour standards, pediatric residency programs have struggled to preserve robust continuity clinic experiences. Many programs have resorted to more flexible approaches to resident scheduling. We know little regarding the impact of such changes. We compared 2 continuity clinic scheduling models: a traditional fixed-day clinic and a variable-day clinic in which resident clinic days vary each week to accommodate resident schedules.

Methods

The setting for our study was a large university resident continuity clinic. We analyzed 111 resident schedules and 1113 visits by children aged younger than 1 year during 2 periods: July 2007 to December 2007, when residents were scheduled by using a variable-day clinic model, and July 2008 to December 2008, when a fixed-day model was used. We compared the number of clinic sessions per resident and continuity of care. We used the usual provider of care definition of continuity: the proportion of visits in which a patient is seen by his or her primary resident. A multivariable logistic regression was used to model the relationship between patient continuity of care and clinic structure (fixed-day vs variable-day), resident level, patient age, and appointment type.

Results

The number of clinics per resident during a 6-month period was higher using variable-day scheduling (19.6 vs 16.2; P < .01), whereas continuity of care was lower (0.54 vs 0.61; P = 0.01) In the multivariate model, continuity of care was significantly higher under the fixed-day model (odds ratio 1.40; P < .01).

Conclusions

Scheduling residents for continuity clinic on variable days results in lower patient continuity of care despite increased resident time in clinic.

### A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy for PTSD [^37a6e666]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors present a multidimensional meta-analysis of studies published between 1980 and 2003 on psychotherapy for PTSD.

Method

Data on variables not previously meta-analyzed such as inclusion and exclusion criteria and rates, recovery and improvement rates, and follow-up data were examined.

Results

Results suggest that psychotherapy for PTSD leads to a large initial improvement from baseline. More than half of patients who complete treatment with various forms of cognitive behavior therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing improve. Reporting of metrics other than effect size provides a somewhat more nuanced account of outcome and generalizability.

Conclusions

The majority of patients treated with psychotherapy for PTSD in randomized trials recover or improve, rendering these approaches some of the most effective psychosocial treatments devised to date. Several caveats, however, are important in applying these findings to patients treated in the community. Exclusion criteria and failure to address polysymptomatic presentations render generalizability to the population of PTSD patients indeterminate. The majority of patients posttreatment continue to have substantial residual symptoms, and follow-up data beyond very brief intervals have been largely absent. Future research intended to generalize to patients in practice should avoid exclusion criteria other than those a sensible clinician would impose in practice (e.g., schizophrenia), should avoid wait-list and other relatively inert control conditions, and should follow patients through at least 2 years.

### Do smoking and socioeconomic factors influence imaging outcomes in axial spondyloarthritis? Five-year data from the DESIR cohort [^865c5d08]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Smoking and socioeconomic factors

The main independent variable of interest was smoking, tested as a binary variable to indicate smoking status (current smoker versus noncurrent smoker), recorded at baseline and at every subsequent visit. Socioeconomic variables included age, sex, ethnicity, job type, educational status, marital status, and parental status (number of children). Ethnicity (white versus nonwhite), educational status (low [non‐university] versus high [university]), and marital status (married versus unmarried) were used as binary variables in the analyses, and parental status (number of children) as a continuous variable. Similarly, job type was based on "collar" profession, handled as a binary variable with blue‐collar indicating physically demanding, manual labor and white‐collar indicating sedentary, office‐based work (14).

Other independent variables of interest, also collected at each visit and tested as potential confounders in the analyses, included clinical variables (extraarticular manifestations, namely uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]; for all variables, if once positive, they were treated as always positive in subsequent visits), laboratory variables (e.g. C‐reactive protein [CRP]), and treatment variables (namely, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], based on computation of the ASAS NSAID score [range 0–400] [15], also tested as a binary variable [NSAID use in the last 6 months], conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs [csDMARDs], and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor [TNFi] use).

### Tocilizumab-aazg (Tyenne) [^9228e3b4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.7 Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Intravenous Administration

The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of active SJIA was assessed in WA18221 (NCT00642460), a 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2-arm study. Patients treated with or without MTX, were randomized (tocilizumab:placebo = 2:1) to one of two treatment groups: 75 patients received tocilizumab infusions every two weeks at either 8 mg per kg for patients at or above 30 kg or 12 mg per kg for patients less than 30 kg and 37 were randomized to receive placebo infusions every two weeks. Corticosteroid tapering could occur from week six for patients who achieved a JIA ACR 70 response. After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab in the open-label extension phase at weight appropriate dosing.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 30% improvement in JIA ACR core set (JIA ACR 30 response) at Week 12 and absence of fever (no temperature at or above 37.5°C in the preceding 7 days). JIA ACR (American College of Rheumatology) responses are defined as the percentage improvement (e.g., 30%, 50%, 70%) in 3 of any 6 core outcome variables compared to baseline, with worsening in no more than 1 of the remaining variables by 30% or more.

Core outcome variables consist of physician global assessment, parent per patient global assessment, number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and functional ability (childhood health assessment questionnaire-CHAQ).

Primary endpoint result and JIA ACR response rates at Week 12 are shown in Table 9.

The treatment effect of tocilizumab was consistent across all components of the JIA ACR response core variables. JIA ACR scores and absence of fever responses in the open label extension were consistent with the controlled portion of the study (data available through 44 weeks).

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^60a934cb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Glossary and terms — core definitions for addiction care and drug testing are provided. Abstinence is defined as "Intentional and consistent restraint from the pathological pursuit of reward and/or relief that involves the use of substances and other behaviors". Adherence is described as a shift from "compliance" and refers to how closely patients cooperate with, follow, and take personal responsibility for implementing treatment plans. Adolescent is defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics as encompassing stages "which occur generally between 11 and 21 years of age". Addiction is described as "A primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry". Analyte is "The component of a biological sample that is identified and measured", and in drug testing "both parent drugs and the products of drug metabolism are targeted". The ASAM Criteria use "6 dimensions to create a holistic biopsychosocial assessment" of an individual for service planning and treatment. Additional terms include collateral report (information from a third party about a patient's substance use), confounders (variables that prevent the accuracy of results), conjugate (a component produced by chemical joining of at least 2 compounds), contingency management (an evidence-based psychosocial intervention using tangible rewards to reinforce positive behaviors), continuing care (aftercare as a stage of continued assistance post-treatment), and cross-reactivity (immunoassays reacting to compounds with similar chemical structures).
