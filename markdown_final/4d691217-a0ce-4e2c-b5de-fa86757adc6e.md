Emergency medicine treatment for asthma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about emergency department treatment for asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and severity stratification. Then, I should verify first-line therapies and delivery methods. Next, I will review adjuncts for nonresponders, including anticholinergics, magnesium, and heliox. After that, I need to check escalation to critical care and ventilatory strategies. I will then examine special populations, discharge planning, and post-ED care, and finally I should confirm what to avoid and how to implement quality improvement elements like protocols and education.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities and severity classification, because treatment hinges on this. I need to check vitals, mental status, speech pattern, accessory muscle use, and pulse oximetry, and I should document peak expiratory flow or FEV1 if feasible without delaying care, since objective lung function better reflects severity than symptoms alone and guides disposition later on [^113GzsoZ] [^112MfK2d]. Hold on, I should verify oxygen saturation thresholds: in pediatrics, saturations below 92% predict hospitalization, and below 90% signal the need for aggressive therapy; in adults, maintaining 93–95% is reasonable while avoiding hyperoxia, so I will titrate oxygen to those targets rather than giving uncontrolled high-flow oxygen [^117CZgdY] [^112VhsBR]. I need to ensure I consider mimics when the presentation is atypical or unresponsive, including anaphylaxis, upper airway obstruction, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and vocal cord dysfunction, so I won't anchor prematurely on asthma without reassessing for red flags [^115YRZDK].

> Next, I should review first-line bronchodilator therapy and delivery. Frequent inhaled short-acting beta-agonists are the cornerstone; pMDI with spacer is preferred for most patients because it is more efficient and reduces infectious aerosol compared with nebulizers, though oxygen-driven nebulization is reasonable if hypoxemic or in severe cases [^117WaQ1z] [^117NU45v]. Wait, let me verify dosing: for adults, 2–8 puffs every 20 minutes initially is typical, escalating to continuous or near-continuous therapy in severe cases; for children, 2–6 puffs every 20 minutes is standard, with nebulized 2.5 mg salbutamol as an alternative, adjusting frequency to response over 1–2 hours [^117NU45v]. I should double-check that IV beta-agonists are not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence and potential harm, so I will avoid them outside of exceptional circumstances [^114QSgjc].

> I will now examine systemic corticosteroids, because early anti-inflammatory therapy changes outcomes. I need to ensure systemic corticosteroids are administered within the first hour for essentially all but the mildest exacerbations, as they speed resolution and reduce relapse; oral therapy is preferred over IV when feasible because it is faster, less invasive, and equally effective [^1117x8e1] [^116KTsTS]. Let me verify durations: adults generally receive 40–50 mg prednisolone daily for 5–7 days, whereas children receive 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days; dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily in adults or 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily in children for 1–2 days is acceptable with better adherence and less vomiting, and there is no need to taper after short courses if the patient is on maintenance ICS [^112UTXGN] [^115zSY4A] [^115sPaLx]. Hold on, I should confirm that evidence shows reduced relapse with systemic steroids after ED discharge; Cochrane data demonstrate fewer relapses and less beta-agonist use without excess adverse effects, supporting routine post-ED steroid prescriptions [^115o6Ere].

> For moderate-to-severe exacerbations or those with poor initial response, I should add ipratropium bromide to SABA. Let me consider the evidence: combination therapy reduces hospitalizations and improves FEV1 and PEF, with the clearest benefit in severe exacerbations, though adverse effects like tremor and palpitations are more common and should be monitored [^117YNbRp] [^115KrAkG]. I should confirm pediatric specifics: in children with moderate-to-severe symptoms and suboptimal SABA response, adding nebulized ipratropium every 20 minutes for the first hour is reasonable before reassessing [^117NU45v].

> If the patient fails to improve after initial therapy, I need to check for indications to use intravenous magnesium sulfate. A single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with severe exacerbations, and pediatric data suggest a substantial reduction in admission odds, albeit with low certainty due to small samples; I should reserve this for severe or refractory cases and those with persistent hypoxemia or FEV1 below about 60% predicted after an hour of care [^113scWj1] [^116hNHji] [^114nqCHR]. Wait, I should verify that routine inhaled or IV magnesium outside of select scenarios is discouraged; yes, GINA advises against routine use of IV or nebulized magnesium beyond targeted indications [^111AQcah].

> Heliox is not routine, but I should consider it in severe, refractory cases not responding to standard therapy. Let me reconsider the balance: evidence is mixed, so if I use heliox, it should be as a bridge while preparing for ICU transfer or in a monitored setting, recognizing that routine use is not supported [^111pwwkN].

> Now I need to ensure escalation criteria to critical care are clear. Transfer to ICU or a higher-acuity setting is indicated for continued deterioration, altered mental status, impending respiratory arrest, or failure to improve despite aggressive therapy; pre-intubation, I should continue bronchodilators and corticosteroids and prepare for noninvasive ventilation only in carefully selected, cooperative patients, avoiding sedation that depresses respiration [^111RpbMb] [^113d8vdw] [^117VMW5L]. Hold on, I should verify ventilator strategies if intubation is required: use low tidal volumes, prolonged expiratory times, and permissive hypercapnia to minimize dynamic hyperinflation and barotrauma, and I should avoid heavy sedation that could worsen ventilator asynchrony and gas trapping [^11575Y5q].

> Special populations require tailored decisions. In pregnancy, I should treat asthma as aggressively as in nonpregnant patients because maternal hypoxemia poses fetal risk; systemic corticosteroids and standard bronchodilators are safe and should not be withheld, and I need to correct undertreatment that has been documented in pregnant ED populations [^113tAZ8V]. In young children, pMDI with spacer is preferred for SABA delivery, and I should use weight-based dosing for corticosteroids; PRAM can help standardize severity scoring and guide therapy and disposition decisions in pediatric EDs [^117NU45v] [^116sDsHF]. For older adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for admission given higher complication risks and comorbidities, and I should double-check for cardiac comorbidity that may complicate bronchodilator choices and monitoring [^114pBjSU].

> Next, I should review reassessment and disposition. I need to check lung function at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response or plateau, because post-treatment PEF or FEV1 is more predictive of disposition than arrival values; discharge is reasonable when lung function exceeds about 60% of predicted or personal best and symptoms are improved, whereas hospitalization is advised if post-treatment values remain below 40% or if there is minimal clinical response [^113d8vdw] [^114pBjSU]. But wait, what if the patient is in the 40–60% gray zone? In that case, I should integrate risk factors such as prior intubation, ICU admission, frequent ED use, poor adherence, or unreliable follow-up when deciding on admission versus extended observation [^114pBjSU].

> Before discharge, I should confirm a comprehensive plan to prevent relapse. All patients should receive a short course of systemic corticosteroids unless contraindicated, and they should be started or stepped up on ICS-containing maintenance therapy because severe exacerbations are a risk factor for future events and ICS reduce hospitalizations and death; written action plans and inhaler technique checks are essential [^117JTinJ] [^114pBjSU] [^1164RQb6]. Hold on, I should verify the role of MART: after an ED visit or hospitalization, MART with ICS-formoterol reduces future severe exacerbations compared with same-dose ICS or ICS-LABA plus SABA, so I will preferentially recommend MART when appropriate and ensure the patient understands how to use it [^116ft1gs]. I need to ensure close follow-up within a week and arrange education on triggers, adherence, and recognition of worsening symptoms to mitigate the substantial early relapse risk after ED care [^112X2Ymh].

> I should double-check what to avoid in routine ED asthma care. Antibiotics are not indicated without clear evidence of bacterial infection such as fever with purulent sputum or radiographic pneumonia, so I will not prescribe them reflexively [^116rnTG6]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have insufficient evidence for acute management and should not be used routinely in the ED, and methylxanthines like theophylline are discouraged due to poor efficacy and adverse effects compared with SABA [^117UAZqk] [^112jnau7]. Sedatives and anxiolytics can precipitate respiratory depression and should be avoided during exacerbations unless absolutely necessary and carefully monitored [^117VMW5L].

> Finally, I need to ensure system-level quality measures are addressed. Protocolized care pathways improve timeliness, adherence to guidelines, and outcomes; incorporating PRAM or similar severity tools, standardized order sets, and education checklists can reduce admission rates and improve discharge readiness, and I should track metrics such as time to SABA, time to steroids, magnesium use, and 30-day ED returns to drive improvement [^111q6hTj] [^116sDsHF]. Let me reconsider whether I have covered the essentials: rapid severity assessment, early SABA with spacer, prompt systemic steroids, add ipratropium for moderate-to-severe disease, escalate with magnesium and consider heliox for refractory cases, avoid harmful or low-value therapies, and close the loop with ICS-containing discharge plans, education, and follow-up; yes, that aligns with contemporary guideline-based care and should reduce morbidity and relapse after ED treatment [^114yaAj6].

---

Emergency management of asthma centers on **rapid bronchodilation with SABA** [^117WaQ1z] and **early systemic corticosteroids** [^1117x8e1] to reduce airway inflammation and prevent relapse. Add **ipratropium** for moderate–severe cases [^117YNbRp] and give **IV magnesium** for severe or refractory exacerbations [^113scWj1] to reduce hospitalizations. Provide **supplemental oxygen** to maintain SpO2 ≥ 93% in adults and 94–98% in children [^114BToAH], and avoid routine antibiotics [^116rnTG6], IV β-agonists [^114QSgjc], or sedatives [^117VMW5L]. Monitor lung function at 1 hour [^113GzsoZ]; consider discharge when FEV1/PEF is ≥ 60% predicted and symptoms are controlled, and ensure follow-up with an asthma action plan and ICS-containing therapy [^116RwoLR].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Rapid assessment of severity guides therapy and disposition; **objective measures are preferred** over symptoms alone [^112MfK2d].

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** | **Lung function** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | - Talks in sentences <br/> - RR mildly increased <br/> - Pulse < 100 <br/> - SpO2 ≥ 95% | PEF/FEV1 > 80% predicted |
| Moderate | - Talks in phrases <br/> - RR increased <br/> - Pulse 100–120 <br/> - SpO2 90–94% | PEF/FEV1 50–80% predicted |
| Severe | - Talks in words <br/> - RR > 30 <br/> - Pulse > 120 <br/> - SpO2 < 90% | PEF/FEV1 < 50% predicted |
| Life-threatening | - Unable to speak <br/> - Cyanosis <br/> - Altered mental status <br/> - Silent chest | PEF/FEV1 < 25% predicted |

---

Document **PEF or FEV1** before treatment if feasible [^113GzsoZ]; if not, obtain as soon as possible and reassess at 1 hour [^113d8vdw].

---

## Oxygen therapy

Titrate oxygen to maintain **SpO2 ≥ 93% in adults and adolescents** and 94–98% in children; avoid hyperoxia, which can worsen hypercapnia [^112VhsBR] [^114BToAH].

---

## Bronchodilator therapy

### Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)

- **First-line therapy**: albuterol/salbutamol via pMDI with spacer or nebulizer [^117NU45v].
- **Initial dose**: 2–8 puffs every 20 minutes for 1–3 doses; severe cases may require continuous nebulization.
- **Most efficient delivery**: pMDI with spacer; oxygen-driven nebulizer if hypoxemic [^117NU45v].

---

### Anticholinergic therapy

Add **ipratropium bromide** to SABA for moderate–severe exacerbations to reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function [^117YNbRp] [^115KrAkG]. Typical dosing is 500 mcg nebulized every 20 minutes for 3 doses.

---

## Systemic corticosteroids

- **Indication**: all but the mildest exacerbations to speed resolution and prevent relapse [^1117x8e1] [^116KTsTS].
- **Preferred route**: oral; IV if unable to take oral [^116KTsTS].
- **Dosing**: adults 40–50 mg prednisolone/day for 5–7 days; children 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days [^112UTXGN].
- **Dexamethasone**: 12–16 mg once daily (adults) or 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily (children) for 1–2 days; similar efficacy, better adherence, less vomiting [^115zSY4A].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate

Consider **IV magnesium sulfate** for severe or refractory exacerbations — especially with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted — to reduce hospitalizations [^113scWj1]. The recommended dose is 2 g IV over 20 minutes.

---

### Heliox

Heliox may be considered for **severe, refractory cases not responding to standard therapy** [^111pwwkN]; it is not routine.

---

### Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)

NIV may be considered for **severe exacerbations with hypercapnia or respiratory distress** [^notfound]; monitor closely and avoid in agitated patients [^113dVi6T].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuously monitor **pulse oximetry**, respiratory rate, heart rate, and mental status, and reassess lung function at 1 hour [^113d8vdw]. Obtain arterial blood gases for severe or refractory cases (e.g. FEV1/PEF < 50% predicted or no improvement) [^111ez4KU].

---

## Disposition criteria

Discharge is appropriate when **FEV1/PEF is ≥ 60% predicted**, symptoms are controlled, and the patient is stable on oral therapy, whereas hospitalization is indicated when FEV1/PEF is < 40% predicted, symptoms persist, or risk factors for relapse are present [^114pBjSU].

---

## Prevention of relapse and follow-up care

- **Written asthma action plan**: provide on discharge [^1164RQb6].
- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: prescribe ongoing therapy to reduce future exacerbations [^116RwoLR].
- **Follow-up**: arrange within 2–7 days; refer to specialist if ≥ 2 exacerbations/year despite Step 4–5 therapy [^116aFjD9].

---

## Special considerations

Avoid **routine antibiotics** unless there is strong evidence of infection [^116rnTG6], and avoid **IV β-agonists** given insufficient evidence and potential harm [^114QSgjc]. Sedatives/anxiolytics should also be avoided due to respiratory depression risk [^117VMW5L].

---

Emergency asthma care emphasizes **early bronchodilation and corticosteroids**, with adjuncts for severe disease, close monitoring, and structured follow-up to prevent relapse.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^114yaAj6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Practical management of acute asthma in adults [^11575Y5q]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^116FAZz5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers in the acute treatment of asthma exacerbations [^112DWuMk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and constitutes a challenging condition for primary health-care providers. Severe exacerbations are also an important cause of hospital admissions and require high costs. Despite this, a widely accepted definition is still lacking; etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms are still incompletely defined. Although the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene modifiers in preventing mild to moderate asthma exacerbation is well recognized, their role within the context of an asthma action plan in general practice and in home-based early intervention for acute exacerbations is still controversial. Although systemic corticosteroids (CS) are standard care for severe exacerbation in the emergency department's (ED) management of asthma, published evidence suggests that high doses of ICS may be beneficial in the ED. The additive benefit of ICS when used with systemic CS is still debated. Data on leukotriene modifiers in the management of asthma exacerbation are limited. However, therapeutic strategies of this emergency including ICS and leukotriene modifiers seem logical and may be suitable, at least in certain patient groups. The availability of different drugs, active on different targets, can potentially contribute to a better management of asthma exacerbations.

### Acute asthma [^115ykJrg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116rnTG6]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use antibiotics routinely in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations unless there is strong evidence of lung infection (such as fever or purulent sputum or radiographic evidence of pneumonia).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1117x8e1]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer systemic corticosteroids in acute care settings to speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapses in all adult, adolescent, and pediatric (6–11 years of age) patients with asthma exacerbation, except for the mildest exacerbations.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^114WYiG4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^114V2FDA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Definition of critical asthma syndromes [^1111NGFd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Urgent visits to the clinic and emergency department for acute severe asthma exacerbations are all too frequent. Existing national guidelines do not present consistent or specific recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of individual asthma patients in respiratory distress. In this vein, we propose the term "critical asthma syndrome" (CAS) to describe any child or adult who is at high risk for fatal asthma. Acute severe asthma, refractory asthma, status asthmaticus, and near-fatal asthma all describe CAS where physical exhaustion from the overwhelming work of breathing leads to respiratory arrest and death from hypoxia or related complications. The authors of this supplement seek to emphasize the importance of early recognition, prompt and coordinated evaluation, and treatment of CAS in the emergency department, hospital, and intensive care units by experienced healthcare provider teams. CAS is not severe persistent asthma where control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations are targets of chronic disease management in the outpatient setting. The authors address the distinctions between the two entities throughout the supplement, and elaborate on the considerations important in the care of a critically ill patient, including the common errors to avoid. In addition, gaps in knowledge and clinical experience in regards to critical asthma are highlighted. Knowledge gaps include a lack of understanding of how to recognize CAS, how to coordinate and integrate hospital and outpatient resources, when to further phenotype patients with critical asthma in order to facilitate effective treatment, and how to prevent future acute exacerbations. Lastly, CAS is complicated by the fact that asthma care in diverse healthcare settings is haphazard. We recommend that primary care physicians refer patients promptly to an asthma specialist for consultation to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and prevent the development of CAS.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113GzsoZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pulmonary function testing in patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to the emergency department. Document peak expiratory flow or FEV1, if possible and without unduly delaying treatment, before initiating treatment. Monitor lung function at 1 hour and at intervals until a clear response to treatment has occurred or a plateau is reached.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^115o6Ere]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department (ED) visits annually. Between 12 to 16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to locate unpublished studies. The most recent search was run in October 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing two types of corticosteroids (oral, intra-muscular, or inhaled) with placebo for outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 374 people were included. One study used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. The review was split into two reviews and although the latest search yielded no additional placebo controlled trials an additional IM study was included. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (Relative risk (RR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 0.74). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.89) and there were fewer subsequent hospitalizations (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta(2)-agonists (mean difference (MD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI -0.47 to 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.44) in the first 7 to 10 days, while rarely reported, showed no significant differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. From these results, as few as ten patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Authors' Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an asthma exacerbation significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care, hospitalizations and use of short-acting beta(2)-agonist without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular and oral corticosteroids are both effective.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Core outcomes and factors influencing the experience of care for children with severe acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative study [^116jzaTQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Management of acute severe asthma exacerbations in children in the emergency department (ED) is complicated by a variety of possible treatment options, significant variation in practice, and little evidence to support the use of one particular medication over another. The Paediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) asthma working group was formed in 2017. It aims to gather the input of patients, families and clinicians to develop a global consensus on outcome measures and create international guidelines for the conduct and reporting of clinical trials of therapies for acute asthma exacerbations in children.

The currently available asthma literature does not include outcomes prioritised by patients and families, and little is known about what is important to them. Further, although asthma affects children across the globe, most research has been conducted in high-income countries. We conducted an international qualitative study to address this gap.

Qualitative methods are recommended to identify outcomes important to stakeholders, help understand why these outcomes are important and identify appropriate language to use when presenting these outcomes in later surveys. Our findings will inform the development of a planned Delphi survey, which aims to achieve consensus on a core outcome set (COS) of clinical trial measures for these patients.

The specific objectives of this study were to determine parent and caregiver opinions on: (1) the patient and family experience of treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation; (2) and which clinical outcomes are the most important to patients and families.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^113zSdTK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects over 17.5 million adults in North America and its prevalence continues to rise, as evidenced by the 12.3% relative increase from 2001 (7.3%) to 2009 (8.2%). Worldwide, asthma prevalence ranges from low (underdeveloped countries) to high (developed countries). Asthma is predominantly a chronic disease that can be controlled with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; however, exacerbations do not always respond to standard or additional treatment options, leading to urgent visits to health providers, admissions to hospital and, in severe and rare cases, death. In the United States, patients with exacerbations had significantly higher asthma-related healthcare costs: $1740 over 1 year compared with $847 for asthmatics without exacerbations. While patients with acute asthma often seek care in the emergency department (ED), most are successfully treated and subsequently discharged; only 6–12% of adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma will be admitted.

The understanding and management of acute asthma have advanced considerably in recent years. Current evidence-based guidelines (National Asthma Education and Prevention Plan (NAEPP), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS)) suggest that early treatment with short-acting β₂-agonists, inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) will reduce hospitalisations. On ED discharge, SCS are recommended, and further studies suggest that prescribing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at discharge can reduce relapse following discharge at least in adult patients. ICS in combination with long-acting β-agonists (ICS/LABA) are more effective than ICS monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, with the number needed to treat of 19 to prevent one exacerbation. On the other hand, the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (ie, ED-based educational strategies) on relapses remains unclear.

### Combined inhaled β-agonist and anticholinergic agents for emergency management in adults with asthma [^115KrAkG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA) are effective therapies for adult patients with acute asthma who present to the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, whether the combination of SAAC and SABA treatment is more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with SABA alone.

Objectives

To conduct an up-to-date systematic search and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone to reduce hospitalisations in adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILACS, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and evidence-based medicine (EBM) databases using controlled vocabulary, natural language terms, and a variety of specific and general terms for inhaled SAAC and SABA drugs. The search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. The Cochrane Airways Group provided search results from the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials which was most recently conducted in July 2016. An extensive search of the grey literature was completed to identify any other potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were randomised or controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC and SABA) to SABA treatment alone to prevent hospitalisations in adults with acute asthma in the emergency department. Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion using pre-determined criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model and reporting heterogeneity (I²). For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trial results using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 23 studies that involved a total of 2724 enrolled participants. Most studies were rated at unclear or high risk of bias. Overall, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I² = 12%; moderate quality of evidence). An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospitalisation after receiving combination therapy (95% 30 to 95), compared to 231 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Although combination inhaled therapy was more effective than SABA treatment alone in reducing hospitalisation in participants with severe asthma exacerbations, this was not found for participants with mild or moderate exacerbations (test for difference between subgroups P = 0.02). Participants receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6; I² = 70%; low quality of evidence), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (MD 36.58 L/min, 95% CI 23.07 to 50.09; participants = 1056; studies = 12; I² = 25%; very low quality of evidence), increased percent change in PEF from baseline (MD 24.88, 95% CI 14.83 to 34.93; participants = 551; studies = 7; I² = 23%; moderate quality of evidence), and were less likely to return to the ED for additional care (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 1180; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) than participants receiving SABA alone. Participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those treated with SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I² = 14%; moderate quality of evidence). Among patients receiving combination therapy, 103 per 1000 were likely to report adverse events (95% 31 to 195 more) compared to 131 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, combination inhaled therapy with SAAC and SABA reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In particular, combination inhaled therapy was more effective in preventing hospitalisation in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation, compared to those with mild-moderate exacerbations, who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised. A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed reductions in the risk of hospitalisation among adults with acute asthma. However, adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience adverse events, such as tremor, agitation, and palpitations, compared to patients receiving SABA alone.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^111MAa9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I²) statistics.

Main Results

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I² = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I² = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁: MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). This article provides an evidence-based review of diagnosis and management of asthma. Early recognition of asthma exacerbations and initiation of treatment are essential. Treatment is dictated by the severity of the exacerbation. Treatment involves bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other treatment modalities including magnesium, heliox, and noninvasive ventilator support are discussed. Safe disposition from the ED can be considered after stabilization of the exacerbation, response to treatment and attaining peak flow measures.

Asthma continues to be an enormous health problem and economic burden in US society. EDs probably will continue to provide a substantial amount of care for those affected by the disease. Pediatric asthma patients frequently are encountered in EDs. Emergency physicians must remain current in their approach to providing expert care while the management of acute asthma exacerbations continues to evolve, older therapies are challenged and new therapies are developed, tested, and implemented.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115vEybj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Inhaled steroids for acute asthma following emergency department discharge [^115e1suT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department (ED) are frequently treated with inhaled beta(2)-agonists and systemic corticosteroids after discharge. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) following discharge may also be beneficial in improving patient outcomes after acute asthma.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of ICS on outcomes in the treatment of acute asthma following discharge from the ED. To quantify the effectiveness of ICS therapy on acute asthma following ED discharge, when used in addition to, or as a substitute for, systemic corticosteroids.

Search Methods

Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register, which consists of systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases supplemented by handsearching of respiratory journals and conference proceedings. In addition, primary authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts also were searched. The searches have been conducted up to September 2012

Selection Criteria

We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients were treated for acute asthma in the ED or its equivalent, and following ED discharge were treated with ICS therapy either in addition to, or as a substitute for, oral corticosteroids. Two review authors independently assessed articles for potential relevance, final inclusion and methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors, or confirmed by the study authors. Several authors and pharmaceutical companies provided unpublished data. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed effect model and heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I²) statistics.

Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion. Three of these trials, involving a total of 909 patients, compared ICS plus systemic corticosteroids versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone. There was no demonstrated benefit of ICS therapy when used in addition to oral corticosteroid therapy in the trials. Relapses were reduced; however, this was not statistically significant with the addition of ICS therapy (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; 3 studies; N = 909). In addition, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the two groups for relapses requiring admission, quality of life, symptom scores or adverse effects. Nine trials, involving a total of 1296 patients compared high-dose ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone after ED discharge. There were no significant differences demonstrated between ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone for relapse rates (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; 4 studies; N = 684), admissions to hospital, or in the secondary outcomes of beta(2)-agonist use, symptoms or adverse events. However, the sample size was not adequate to exclude the possibility of either treatment being significantly inferior and people with severe asthma were excluded from these trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy provides additional benefit when used in combination with standard systemic corticosteroid therapy upon ED discharge for acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS therapy alone may be as effective as oral corticosteroid therapy when used in mild asthmatics upon ED discharge; however, the confidence intervals were too wide to be confident of equal effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify whether ICS therapy should be employed in acute asthma treatment following ED discharge. The review does not suggest any reason to stop usual treatment with ICS following ED discharge, even if a course of oral corticosteroids are prescribed.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of asthma mimics [^115YRZDK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common diagnosis or preexisting condition, and many patients with acute asthma exacerbation may present to the emergency department with wheezing and respiratory distress. However, many conditions may mimic this presentation.

Objectives

This review provides an overview of common asthma mimics and an approach to evaluation and management.

Discussion

Asthma is characterized by an obstructive pulmonary disease with recurrent exacerbations. The disease may present with a variety of symptoms, including wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and even respiratory failure. Mimics include anaphylaxis, angioedema, central airway obstruction, heart failure, allergic reaction, foreign body aspiration, pulmonary embolism, and vocal cord dysfunction. The approach to evaluation and management of these patients includes assessment for life-threatening conditions while treatment and resuscitation is underway. Providers should assess for red flags, including no history of asthma, lack of severe asthma, and no improvement with standard treatments. Focused assessment with history, physical examination, chest imaging, electrocardiogram, and laboratory studies may provide benefit. Through consideration of these mimics and treatment, providers can provide rapid management.

Conclusions

While asthma is a common disease, many asthma mimics exist. Through consideration of other diseases with wheezing and assessing for red flags, such as patients presenting without a history of asthma or patients with a history of only mild asthma presenting with severe symptoms, emergency providers may decrease the chance of early diagnostic closure and anchoring while improving the care of these patients.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^11628AGv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

While considerable improvement in the management of acute asthma should lead to better outcomes over time, practice variation does exist and many patients presenting to EDs do not always receive evidence-based treatment. Moreover, what works in certain settings may not be applicable to others. Despite the dissemination of effective interventions for the prevention of relapses after asthma exacerbations, these outcomes still occur, affect the quality of lifeof patients with asthma and represent significant costs to the healthcare system.

A number of studies have examined factors associated with relapse outcomes in adults after ED discharge. Notwithstanding this research, there remains a relative paucity of literature attempting to compile the existing information to influence management. The objective of this study was to summarise the evidence regarding relapses and factors associated with increased relapse in patients discharged from EDs after being treated for asthma exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112X2Ymh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Ipratropium bromide for acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency setting: a literature review of the evidence [^111fzTGS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Since the 1970s, when inhaled anticholinergic agents were first introduced as adjunct therapies for the immediate treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations, several trials have shown varying degrees of benefit from their use as bronchodilators in combination with inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists and systemic corticosteroids. Although other anticholinergics exist, ipratropium bromide (IB) specifically has emerged as the overwhelming choice of pulmonologists and emergency physicians because of its limited systemic absorption from the lungs when given as an inhaled preparation. However, although the varying trials, predominantly in the emergency department setting, have typically shown a trend toward improved outcomes, none has set forth clear dosing protocol recommendations for use by practicing physicians. It is our goal in this review of the available literature on the use of IB, as an adjunct to inhaled short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, to summarize practical, evidence-based recommendations for use in the pediatric emergency department setting for acute asthma exacerbations. We also hope to better delineate the most effective dosing regimen in those patients who might benefit most from the addition of IB and to explore proposed additional benefits it may have as a modulator of cholinergic-induced effects from high-dose beta-agonist therapy and viral triggers.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in acute asthma: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^114GNzpG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations are a common and important cause of attendance at emergency departments (ED) and subsequent hospital admissions. Despite previous reviews reporting that in acute settings the risk of hospital admission is reduced with the use of high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), this evidence has not changed clinical practice.

Objective

To estimate the efficacy of ICS in the treatment of acute asthma in ED.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were identified using PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The primary outcome was hospital admission rates. The primary comparison was between administration of ICS in addition to systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and to SCS alone. Secondary comparisons were ICS alone compared with SCS alone and ICS compared with placebo.

Results

There were 25 studies involving 2733 participants. For the primary comparison, ICS in addition to SCS reduced the risk of hospital admission compared with SCS; fixed-effects odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.73 (0.57–0.94). Lung function was poorly reported. There was moderate evidence of an improvement in clinical scores and vital signs with ICS in addition to SCS. Relatively few studies reported adverse events.

Conclusion

There is moderate evidence that high doses of ICS, in addition to SCS, reduce the risk of hospital admission in ED treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations. Further research is required to determine their optimal role in both ED and outpatient settings.

### Are acute asthma presentations to the emergency department an opportunity for optimising long-term management? A qualitative study on beliefs and behaviours of healthcare professionals [^113xg7QD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Guidelines recommend Emergency Department (ED) healthcare professionals (HCPs) ensure patients have a supply of inhaled corticosteroid on discharge after an acute asthma presentation. By optimising medication, acute asthma presentations to EDs are a potentially reachable moment to improve long-term asthma management as well as treating the acute exacerbation. Optimising medication for long-term asthma management requires behavioural changes from HCPs, which may be considered unacceptable or unfeasible. Understanding health beliefs and attitudes of HCPs who provide asthma treatment in emergency care is a critical step in determining whether interventions could be developed to address this.

Aims

To explore the health beliefs, attitudes and behaviours of HCPs involved in the care of adult patients presenting to the ED with asthma.

Methods

UK HCPs, purposively sampled for profession, experience and work setting, were invited to participate in a semi-structured face-to-face or online interview. These were conducted between November 2021 and June 2022. Eligible participants had experience of caring for patients with asthma in either the ED or primary care setting. Interviews were analysed with reflective thematic analysis.

Results

19 HCPs were interviewed. Four themes were identified, constructed around the beliefs and behaviours of HCPs: (1) Compassionate understanding, that is, recognising the accessibility of ED, patients' self-management and the emotional aspects of exacerbations, (2) Doing what is right for the patient, that is, maximising a reachable moment, (3) Tensions of capacity in the system, that is, acknowledging workload within ED and (4) ED as providers of preventative care.

Conclusion

This study found HCPs recognise both the accessibility of the ED as a place for patients to seek help and that there are potential opportunities to optimise asthma control, but there are barriers to overcome. ED professionals may be willing to make changes in the best interests of the patients if they can follow guidelines and receive training.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### Childhood asthma: a guide for pediatric emergency medicine providers [^115RJEfs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatric asthma is a disease that is managed across outpatient physicians, hospitalists, critical care physicians, and emergency department (ED) physicians. Scoring systems may facilitate a rapid assessment of the child with asthma in the ED. Short-acting beta agonists are still the mainstay of therapy for acute exacerbations along with corticosteroids and ipratropium bromide. ED providers must also know the indications for noninvasive ventilation and intubation. Most patients can be treated and discharged from the ED after acute exacerbation, and should be given a plan for going home that provides educational material and emergency scenarios to help prevent future acute incidents.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department [^116hNHji]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible. Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services. Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of IV MgSO4 in adults treated for acute asthma in the emergency department.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014. We also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults treated in the emergency department (ED) for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1. We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I² = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I² = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I² = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^115D4m9D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma The use of ICS may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma to the ED or its equivalent, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper.

Main Results

Seven trials were selected for inclusion, but data were not available for one of them. In the six usable trials, (4 adult, 2 paediatric), a total of 352 patients were studied (179 ICS, 173 non-ICS treated). Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64). This benefit was confined to patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (CS). Patients receiving concomitant CS showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.14). Patients receiving ICS also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared ICS alone vs CS alone; in the four trials included, there was significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates which precluded meaningful pooling of the study results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhaled steroids reduced admission rates in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that ICS alone is as effective as CS. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to CS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114pBjSU]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — criteria for hospitalization versus discharge from the emergency department prioritize that clinical status and lung function 1 hour after treatment are more reliable predictors than arrival status, and provide spirometric thresholds and risk factors to guide decisions. Hospitalization is recommended if pre-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 25% predicted or personal best, or if post-treatment FEV1 or PEF is < 40% predicted or personal best. Discharge may be possible when post-treatment lung function is 40–60% predicted after considering patient risk factors and availability of follow-up care, and discharge is recommended when post-treatment lung function is > 60% predicted or personal best after considering risk factors and follow-up care availability. Other factors associated with increased likelihood of admission include female sex, older age and non-white race; use of more than eight beta2 agonist puffs in the previous 24 hours; severity indicators such as respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation < 95%, and final PEF < 50% predicted; past history of severe exacerbations; and previous unscheduled office and emergency department visits requiring use of OCS.

### Asthma treatment protocols in the emergency department: are they effective? [^111q6hTj]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Management of asthma in emergency departments (ED) has been well documented to be deficient over many years, despite national and international guidelines. This review summarizes the effect of ED protocols aimed at improving the assessment and treatment of asthma in the ED. We performed a PubMed search of the English literature for ED asthma protocols published from 1986 to 2006 and identified 11 studies. Protocols were effective in improving at least some areas of management, including use of appropriate patient assessment, drug therapy per national guidelines, and patient education. A small number of protocols with the specific aims of reducing the length of stay in the ED as well as rates of hospital admission and return visits were effective. Persistent education of ED staff regarding protocols based on current management guidelines and adoption of easy-to-use forms can facilitate improved care of patients with asthma in the ED.

### Are acute asthma presentations to the emergency department an opportunity for optimising long-term management? A qualitative study on beliefs and behaviours of healthcare professionals [^111QvBFb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HCPs recognised the ED as a place in which patients increasingly seek help for the management of long-term conditions. Despite some disagreement on whether the ED should have a role in chronic disease management, and concerns about capacity in the system, emergency healthcare providers felt that it would be feasible to prescribe more optimum inhaled therapy in some instances. ED professionals wanted to follow guidelines and training to ensure action taken was in the best interests of the patients. Implementation would require good communication between primary care and the ED, and resources within the ED to add this practice change.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in the acute and chronic management of asthma [^114JWusN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute asthma is common and severe exacerbations may result in hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and, rarely, death. Standard emergency care includes systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, but additional treatments may be required in severe cases. We summarize the substantial evidence regarding the role of MgSO4 in acute asthma and comments on the potential benefit in chronic asthma.

Recent Findings

Inhaled and intravenous MgSO4 agents are used in the treatment of acute asthma, but only the intravenous formulation is effective. In severe asthma exacerbations, a single bolus dose of intravenous MgSO4 reduces admissions and improves pulmonary functions. Inhaled MgSO4 is more effective than placebo as a bronchodilator, but performs no better than salbutamol and there is no apparent synergy when the two are combined. Whereas intravenous MgSO4 treatments appear to be effective, long-term 'replacement' therapy with magnesium does not appear to affect chronic asthma.

Summary

Evidence suggests that intravenous MgSO4 is beneficial in acute asthma, while the evidence for inhaled MgSO4 is less convincing. Moreover, the role of replacement therapy with oral magnesium remains to be clarified. The use of intravenous MgSO4 remains uncommon, with emergency physicians appropriately restricting its use to patients with severe exacerbations.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

### Evaluating the clinical impact of a novel pediatric emergency medicine curriculum on asthma outcomes in Belize [^116sDsHF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

According to World Health Organization estimates, asthma is the most common childhood disease, affecting 339 million individuals. It is globally underdiagnosed and undertreated, with more than 80% of asthma-related deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to timely diagnosis and treatment, principally with corticosteroids and β-agonists, has been shown to reduce symptoms, hospitalization, mortality, and health resource usage. – Despite guidelines and evidence for corticosteroids decreasing admission rates and ED returns in pediatric asthma patients, they are often underprescribed. –

National organizations have created varying guidelines for acute pediatric asthma care to improve implementation measures. Many research groups have actualized evidence-based pediatric asthma pathways in EDs adhering to national guidelines. This approach has generally resulted in positive clinical outcomes. Adherence to a clinical pathway decreases hospitalizations. Well-designed, evidence-based care plans improve the quality and efficiency of ED asthma care while also reducing hospital admissions. In addition, a standardized asthma severity score improves the time to administering asthma treatment. Many of these pathways use a scoring tool to assess the severity of the asthma exacerbation and direct care along a given pathway. These scores normalize communication across the health care team and facilitate assessment, treatment, and disposition of the patient. There are multiple scoring tools available. The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) is a validated clinical scoring tool for measuring asthma severity for all pediatric ages with good interrater reliability.

We hypothesized that by using a novel pediatric asthma educational curriculum and implementing an evidence-based clinical care protocol for pediatric asthma exacerbations in the ED, we could improve the timeliness of clinical interventions and streamline asthma care in accordance with current standards of pediatric asthma care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MfK2d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117NU45v]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy — inhaled bronchodilator therapy states the initial dose of inhaled short-acting beta agonist (SABA) may be given by a pMDI with spacer and mask or mouthpiece or an air-driven nebulizer, or, if oxygen saturation is low, by an oxygen-driven nebulizer. For most children, pMDI plus spacer is favored as it is more efficient than a nebulizer for bronchodilator delivery (Evidence A), and nebulizers can spread infectious particles. The initial dose is two puffs of salbutamol (100 mcg per puff) or equivalent, except in acute, severe asthma when six puffs should be given; when a nebulizer is used, a dose of 2.5 mg salbutamol solution is recommended, with dosing frequency based on response observed over 1–2 hours. For children with moderate-severe exacerbations and a poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide may be added every 20 minutes for 1 hour only.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^115nDn6C]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol

A study protocol was developed a priori to define the objectives, search strategy, eligibility criteria, outcomes of interest, the process for abstracting and synthesising information from eligible studies, and the methods for data analysis. The systematic review conforms to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered with International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42015023844). No ethics approval was required.

Literature search

Comprehensive searches of seven electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILAC, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were conducted from their inception to June 2015. The search strategy was designed by a health sciences librarian (LD) and comprised controlled vocabulary and keywords. The search used a slightly modified version of an 'emergency room' search filter(see online supplementary appendix A; complete search strategy is available on request).

References were manually selected from the first 10 pages of Google Scholar. In addition, proceedings from important Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) and US Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) conferences held between 2005 and 2015 that involved research presentations were hand-searched. No limits were applied on the basis of date, study design, language or publication status.

Study selection

The review included studies assessing the proportion of adult patients (or adults and children with ≥ 80% of the study population being ≥ 17 years of age) relapsing after receiving treatment in the ED for an asthma exacerbation. Relapse and variables significantly associated with relapse after multivariable modelling were the primary outcomes presented in this review. To be included as factors associated with relapse, studies must have conducted adjusted analyses. Relapse was defined as an urgent visit to any ED, clinic or physician office for worsening asthma symptoms within 4 weeks of the initial ED visit. Secondary outcomes included time between ED discharge and relapse, and medical management received in the ED.

Two reviewers (JH, NA) independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the literature search. Articles initially deemed relevant and those whose abstracts and titles provided insufficient information were retrieved and independently reviewed (JH, NA) to determine study eligibility. Disagreements were discussed and resolved with a third party (CVR).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113q9nZJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (use, safety, and counseling for LAMA): The Expert Panel makes suggestions that a LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma as part of Step 4 therapy, but add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile; individuals at risk of urinary retention and those who have glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy; the small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Blacks; LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices and clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices appropriately; when clinicians prescribe LAMA therapy, they should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting and that LAMA therapy does not have a role in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in the ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings; and clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA.

### Pregnancy related treatment disparities of acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^113tAZ8V]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Asthma is one of the most common medical conditions complicating pregnancy. Despite the presence of published guidelines outlining the care of the pregnant patient with asthma, disparities in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency department related to pregnancy status are known to exist. We sought to determine if pregnancy status affected the treatment of women presenting to a tertiary emergency department for care of acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

We retrospectively compared the emergency department treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in 123 pregnant women to 123 non-pregnant controls. Asthma exacerbations were classified by severity according to pre-determined criteria.

Results

In the emergency department (ED), pregnant women were significantly less likely to be treated with systemic corticosteroids than non-pregnant controls (50.8% versus 72.4%, p = 0.001). Similarly, 41% of pregnant women received prescriptions for prednisone at the time of discharge from the ED compared to 69.2% of non-pregnant women (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this population of asthmatics presenting to a tertiary emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations, pregnant women were less likely to receive appropriate therapy with systemic corticosteroids.

### Inappropriate home albuterol use during an acute asthma exacerbation [^113WrTBF]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Increased asthma morbidity and mortality is associated with inappropriate home self-management skills.

Objectives

To examine the proportion of children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an acute asthma exacerbation with incorrect home use of their albuterol inhaler and to identify factors associated with improper treatment.

Methods

Caregivers of children with asthma aged 4 to 14 years, presenting to the ED with an asthma exacerbation, participated in the study. Interviewers collected caregiver's perceived severity of the asthma exacerbation and home albuterol use before the ED visit. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines were used to classify home albuterol use as appropriate or inappropriate.

Results

Home albuterol use for the current asthma exacerbation was categorized as inappropriate (56 [68%]) and appropriate (26 [32%]) for 84 participants. Thirty-nine of the inappropriate group undertreated, with 24 not giving albuterol frequently enough and 15 without albuterol at home. Other reasons for incorrect home albuterol use included: no spacer, overtreating, overreacting, and using a controller medicine for quick relief. Those with appropriate albuterol use were more likely to have their child hospitalized for asthma in the past 48 months (P = 0.004). Caregivers with inappropriate use perceived their child's asthma exacerbation as more severe (P < .001) compared with physician rating. Physicians rated asthma severity higher in the appropriate group than the inappropriate group (P < .001).

Conclusion

A significant proportion of caregivers incorrectly treat children's asthma exacerbation with albuterol. Despite perceiving their children's asthma exacerbations as more severe, most undertreat with albuterol. Correctly assessing asthma symptom severity and appropriate home albuterol use may be linked to disease experience.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^114nKDjP]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a heterogeneous lung disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. Asthma poses a significant level of morbidity and mortality globally. Although evidence-based treatments are available in most countries, asthma control remains suboptimal, and asthma-related deaths continue to be an ongoing concern. Generally, it is believed that between 50 to 75% of patients with asthma can be considered as having mild asthma. Although the symptoms may not be very troublesome or frequent, airway inflammation is usually present in those with mild asthma and patients may be at risk of acute asthma exacerbations and death. An expert review estimated that the frequency of severe exacerbations in mild asthma ranged between 0.12 to 0.77 per patient-year. Further, the review highlighted that between 30 and 40% of exacerbations requiring emergency care appear to be in patients with mild asthma. In general, asthma exacerbations impose a significant disease burden, including hospitalisation, a greater progressive decline in lung function, impairment in quality of life (QoL) and death. Moreover, asthma patients with exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation are at increased risk for future exacerbations, independent of demographic, clinical factors, asthma severity and asthma control. Asthma exacerbations also have been shown to cause a significant financial burden on health systems. For example, in a US study which retrospectively analysed administrative claims data, asthma patients who experienced exacerbations had nearly twice the health care and asthma specific costs compared with patients without exacerbations. Preventing the risk of future exacerbations is, therefore, an important target, particularly in patients with mild asthma, where there may be complacence both by the patient or their health professionals.

### Patient-and parent-initiated oral steroids for asthma exacerbations [^112oMrR4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways affecting an estimated 334 million people worldwide. During severe exacerbations, patients may need to attend a medical centre or hospital emergency department for treatment with systemic corticosteroids, which can be administered intravenously or orally. Some people with asthma are prescribed oral corticosteroids (OCS) for self-administration (i.e. patient-initiated) or to administer to their child with asthma (i.e. parent-initiated), in the event of an exacerbation. This approach to treatment is becoming increasingly common.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of patient- or parent-initiated oral steroids for adults and children with asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We identified trials from Cochrane Airways' Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR from its inception to 18 May 2016 and trial registries from their inception to 24 August 2016; we imposed no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data; we excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies where adults (aged 18 years or older) or children of school age (aged 5 years or older) with asthma were randomised to receive: (a) any patient-/parent-initiated OCS or (b) placebo, normal care, alternative active treatment, or an identical personalised asthma action plan without the patient- or parent-initiated OCS component.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to identify any studies that met the prespecified inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were hospital admissions for asthma, asthma symptoms at follow-up and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite comprehensive searches of electronic databases and clinical trial registries, we did not identify any studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Five potentially relevant studies were excluded for two reasons: the intervention did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review (three studies) and studies had a cross-over design (two studies). Two of the excluded studies asked the relevant clinical question. However, these studies were excluded due to their cross-over design, as per the protocol. We contacted the authors of the cross-over trials who were unable to provide data for the first treatment period (i.e. prior to cross-over).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials (non-cross-over design) to inform the use of patient- or parent-initiated oral corticosteroids in people with asthma.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; p = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating children with acute asthma in the emergency department [^114nqCHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma in children can be life-threatening and must be treated promptly in the emergency setting. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended by various guidelines for cases of acute asthma that have not responded to first-line treatment with bronchodilators and steroids. The treatment has recently been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether it is equally effective for children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in children treated for acute asthma in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register up to 23 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children treated in the ED for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the search and independently extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted study authors in cases of missing data and other uncertainties relating to the studies. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean differences, both using fixed-effect models. We assessed each study for risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence for each outcome with GRADE and presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. There was insufficient evidence to conduct the planned subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Five studies (182 children) met the inclusion criteria, and four contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias, but our confidence in the evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small sample sizes. Treatment with IV MgSO4 reduced the odds of admission to hospital by 68% (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.74; children = 115; studies = 3; I² = 63%). This result was based on data from just three studies including 115 children. Meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes was extremely limited by paucity of data. We performed meta-analysis for the outcome 'return to the emergency department within 48 hours', which showed a very imprecise effect estimate that was not statistically significant (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.30; children = 85; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%). Side effects and adverse events were not consistently reported and meta-analysis was not possible, however few side effects or adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

IV MgSO4 may reduce the need for hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma, but the evidence is extremely limited by the number and size of studies. Few side effects of the treatment were reported, but the data were extremely limited.

Background: Acute asthma attacks occur when there is progressive airway narrowing caused by airway edema, inflammation, and increased bronchiolar smooth-muscle tone. The goals of treatment are to improve oxygen flow, reduce airway narrowing with rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilators, and decrease airway inflammation with early administration of systemic corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids decreases the need to hospitalize patients with acute asthma attacks. Inhaled corticosteroids have been considered ineffective in treating acute exacerbations. Previous systematic reviews of inhaled corticosteroids in acute asthma attacks have shown inconsistent results. Rodrigo analyzed the best published data on the early effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency department.

The Study: The author searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials that assessed the early effect of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma in the emergency department. The author also searched references from the selected articles, the top 20 respiratory and emergency care journals, and unpublished data from primary authors of the articles. The inclusion criteria were randomized trials that evaluated inhaled corticosteroids in the management of acute asthma in children six months to 17 years of age and adults 18 years and older. Trials had to compare inhaled corticosteroids with placebo or systemic corticosteroids, and must have evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention one to four hours after initiating therapy. Main outcome measures were admission to the hospital and emergency department discharges. Secondary outcomes included spirometry measurements, clinical symptoms, heart and respiratory rates, oxygen saturation levels, and adverse effects.

When all trials that used multiple dosing of inhaled corticosteroids were pooled, there was a significant reduction in the hospital admission rate. Discharge rates from emergency departments after two to three hours of treatment were greater in the inhaled corticosteroid group compared with placebo and systemic corticosteroids groups. Spirometry measurements were also significantly better in the inhaled corticosteroid group, particularly in those receiving multiple doses. None of the studies reported serious adverse effects with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Conclusion: The author concludes that inhaled corticosteroids appear to have a favorable effect on adults and children with acute asthma attacks if used early in the treatment plan. This is particularly true if multiple doses are given at intervals of 30 minutes or less over a total of 90 to 120 minutes.
