## Question

dexamehtaone for pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dexamethasone should be used for pneumonia, and if so, in whom, at what dose, and how to reconcile conflicting evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of pneumonia. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend for severe versus non-severe community-acquired pneumonia. Next, I will examine randomized trials and meta-analyses specific to dexamethasone, and I need to check whether benefits are agent-specific. After that, I should review safety signals and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note special populations like COVID-19 and influenza where the calculus differs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: community-acquired pneumonia spans non-severe disease on the wards to severe disease requiring ICU-level care, and the strength of evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids differs by severity and by steroid molecule, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing across all pneumonia patients [^115mMXga] [^111GQZsG].

> I should confirm guideline positions before diving into trials. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline issued a strong recommendation against routine corticosteroids in non-severe CAP and a conditional recommendation against routine corticosteroids in severe CAP, emphasizing uncertainty and potential harms, which sets a conservative baseline for practice [^115mMXga] [^116p3gaD]. Wait, let me verify the most recent updates: the 2024 SCCM focused update now recommends administering corticosteroids for adult inpatients with severe bacterial CAP, reflecting newer evidence and a judged favorable balance of benefits and harms in that subgroup, while still making no recommendation for less severe CAP, which aligns with a severity-stratified approach rather than blanket use [^114y8xbu] [^116LeFzN] [^115RaUSV]. I should also note that the 2025 ATS update signals a shift toward considering systemic corticosteroids in severe CAP, reinforcing this trajectory while still calling for judicious, severity-based application [^116arY2y].

> Next, I will examine dexamethasone-specific data. The most direct signal comes from a randomized, double-blind trial in non-ICU CAP where dexamethasone 5 mg IV daily for 4 days reduced length of stay by about 1 day without affecting mortality, but with a marked increase in hyperglycemia, which tempers enthusiasm outside carefully selected contexts [^112xp8WY]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates to severe CAP: multiple meta-analyses and network meta-analyses suggest that when corticosteroids help mortality in severe CAP, the benefit is driven by hydrocortisone rather than dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, indicating a possible agent-specific effect rather than a class-wide benefit [^116ULE3m] [^114RQ84x] [^114Bzxxq]. Let me reconsider the mechanistic plausibility: hydrocortisone's mineralocorticoid activity and shorter half-life may confer hemodynamic advantages and more balanced immunomodulation in septic inflammatory states, which could explain differential outcomes, though this remains hypothesis-generating pending head-to-head trials [^114Bzxxq].

> I need to check safety signals carefully. Across trials, hyperglycemia requiring intervention is consistently more frequent with corticosteroids, with relative risks around 1.3–1.7, and there are concerns for secondary infections and other steroid toxicities, even though pooled analyses have not always shown a significant increase in serious adverse events beyond hyperglycemia; nonetheless, real-world harms like GI bleeding have been reported with indiscriminate steroid use in CAP, so I should counsel on monitoring and risk mitigation if steroids are used [^111QpFWJ] [^114jyeX6]. But wait, what if the patient has diabetes or is otherwise high risk for hyperglycemia? In that case, the threshold to use steroids should be higher, and if used, insulin protocols and frequent glucose checks are prudent [^111QpFWJ].

> Now, I will synthesize by severity. For non-severe CAP, I should confirm that routine dexamethasone is not recommended: the modest LOS reduction does not outweigh hyperglycemia risks and lack of mortality benefit, so standard care without steroids remains appropriate [^115mMXga] [^112xp8WY]. For severe CAP, I initially thought dexamethasone might carry the same mortality benefit seen with hydrocortisone, but wait, the aggregate data indicate that mortality benefits in severe CAP are primarily observed with hydrocortisone, not dexamethasone; thus, if a corticosteroid is chosen for severe bacterial CAP, hydrocortisone is the preferred agent based on current evidence, whereas dexamethasone may still reduce progression to mechanical ventilation and shorten stay but has not consistently reduced mortality in this setting [^116ULE3m] [^112aHF5s] [^114RQ84x]. I should double-check dosing guidance: typical regimens are 200–400 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent for about 5–7 days, with some protocols using fixed-duration courses and others tapering based on clinical response, and the SCCM update acknowledges multiple acceptable strategies within this range [^112nc1MD] [^115RaUSV].

> Let me consider special populations. In COVID-19 pneumonia, dexamethasone is recommended for patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation due to consistent mortality and ventilation benefits, and this is a different disease biology than bacterial CAP, so extrapolation to non-COVID pneumonia would be inappropriate [^114PoSyP] [^1155bpnJ]. In influenza pneumonia, corticosteroids are associated with higher mortality, longer ICU stay, and more secondary infections, so they should be avoided outside research settings or compelling non-influenza indications [^113g534B] [^111mMKdw]. For immunocompromised hosts, I need to ensure we do not worsen infectious risk; current CAP guidance does not support routine steroids in this group, reinforcing caution and individualized decisions [^notfound].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations. High-quality pediatric data are sparse, and major guidelines make no recommendation for routine corticosteroids in pediatric CAP due to insufficient evidence, so steroids should not be used routinely in children with CAP outside of specific indications like asthma/COPD exacerbation or other established steroid-responsive conditions [^112yQ37o].

> Bringing this together, my practical approach is as follows. For non-severe CAP, do not add dexamethasone; focus on timely antibiotics, supportive care, and risk stratification. For severe bacterial CAP, consider adjunctive corticosteroids, and if chosen, prefer hydrocortisone based on current mortality data, using 200–400 mg/day hydrocortisone equivalent for 5–7 days with close glucose monitoring and vigilance for infections; dexamethasone is not the first-line steroid for severe CAP given the lack of consistent mortality benefit, though it may still reduce ventilation needs and length of stay in some analyses, so if hydrocortisone is unavailable or contraindicated, a short, low-dose dexamethasone course could be considered with explicit counseling on uncertain mortality effects and hyperglycemia risk [^114y8xbu] [^116ULE3m] [^111tVfws] [^112xp8WY]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the evolving consensus: yes, this severity-stratified, hydrocortisone-preferring approach reflects the 2024 critical care guidance and contemporary meta-analytic data, while honoring the 2019 ATS/IDSA caution and the 2025 ATS shift toward considering steroids in severe CAP [^114y8xbu] [^115mMXga] [^116arY2y].

Dexamethasone is **not routinely recommended** for pneumonia, but may be considered as adjunctive therapy in **severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)** [^114y8xbu] — especially with septic shock or ARDS — to reduce mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission [^1136GLTA] [^111tVfws]. It is **not recommended for non-severe CAP** due to limited benefit and potential harms, such as hyperglycemia and secondary infections [^115mMXga] [^111B5t6z]. If used, typical dosing is 5–6 mg IV/PO daily for 5–7 days, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^1136GLTA] [^112nc1MD].

## Clinical evidence for dexamethasone in pneumonia

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

- **CAPE COD trial**: Hydrocortisone reduced 28-day mortality in severe CAP (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.94) [^notfound].
- **Meta-analyses**: Corticosteroids reduce mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission in severe CAP, with hydrocortisone showing the most consistent benefit [^111tVfws] [^116ULE3m].
- **SCCM 2024**: Recommends corticosteroids for severe bacterial CAP (moderate certainty) [^116LeFzN].

---

### Non-severe community-acquired pneumonia

For non-severe CAP, **routine corticosteroids are not recommended** [^115mMXga] because benefits are limited and harms (e.g. hyperglycemia) may occur [^1136GLTA]. The **LANCET 2011 trial** showed dexamethasone shortened hospital stay by ~1 day but increased hyperglycemia, with no mortality benefit [^112xp8WY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for corticosteroids in pneumonia** |
|-|-|
| ATS/IDSA 2019 | - Do not use routinely in non-severe CAP [^115mMXga] <br/> - Conditional against routine use in severe CAP [^115mMXga] |
| SCCM 2024 | Recommend corticosteroids for severe bacterial CAP (moderate certainty) [^116LeFzN] |
| ESCMID 2023 | Consider corticosteroids in severe CAP with shock [^112Jy62P] |

---

## Potential benefits of dexamethasone in pneumonia

- **Reduced mortality**: Particularly in severe CAP with shock or ARDS [^1136GLTA] [^114Gnwzn].
- **Shorter hospital stay**: Modest reduction in length of stay [^112xp8WY].
- **Lower mechanical ventilation**: Reduced need in severe CAP [^111tVfws].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common and may require insulin [^112xp8WY] [^111QpFWJ].
- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk, especially in immunocompromised patients [^113mZio5].
- **Other effects**: Fluid retention, hypertension, psychiatric effects, and gastrointestinal bleeding [^114jyeX6].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from dexamethasone

- **Severe CAP**: ICU admission, septic shock, or ARDS [^111GQZsG].
- **High inflammatory response**: Elevated CRP or procalcitonin [^117HweE8].
- **COVID-19 pneumonia**: Requires oxygen or mechanical ventilation [^1155bpnJ].

---

## Patient populations where dexamethasone is not recommended

- **Non-severe CAP**: Routine use not recommended [^115mMXga] [^111B5t6z].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased infection risk [^notfound].
- **Influenza pneumonia**: Associated with higher mortality and complications [^113g534B].

---

## Optimal dosing and administration

Typical dosing is **dexamethasone 5–6 mg IV or PO daily for 5–7 days** [^1136GLTA] [^112nc1MD]; duration is commonly 5–7 days, with longer courses increasing adverse effects.

---

## Comparison with other corticosteroids

Hydrocortisone has the **strongest evidence** for mortality benefit in severe CAP [^116JaKRd] [^111tVfws], whereas **methylprednisolone** shows limited benefit and is less consistently effective [^116ULE3m].

---

## Current research gaps and ongoing studies

- **Optimal dose and duration**: Unclear for dexamethasone in severe CAP [^111QYbg7].
- **Patient selection**: Biomarkers to identify responders are needed [^11625v4U].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Limited data on delayed harms [^111q5Y1S].

---

Dexamethasone is **not routine for pneumonia** but may be used in severe CAP, especially with shock or ARDS, to reduce mortality and ventilation needs [^114y8xbu]. It is not recommended for non-severe CAP due to limited benefit and potential harms [^115mMXga]. If used, give 5–6 mg daily for 5–7 days with close monitoring [^1136GLTA].

### Corticosteroids for pneumonia [^111Tb4BV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious illness. Corticosteroids have been suggested for the treatment of different types of infection, however their role in the treatment of pneumonia remains unclear. This is an update of a review published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the treatment of pneumonia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 3 March 2017, together with relevant conference proceedings and references of identified trials. We also searched three trials registers for ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic corticosteroid therapy, given as adjunct to antibiotic treatment, versus placebo or no corticosteroids for adults and children with pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We estimated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled data using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model when possible.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs comprising a total of 2264 participants; 13 RCTs included 1954 adult participants, and four RCTs included 310 children. This update included 12 new studies, excluded one previously included study, and excluded five new trials. One trial awaits classification. All trials limited inclusion to inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). We assessed the risk of selection bias and attrition bias as low or unclear overall. We assessed performance bias risk as low for nine trials, unclear for one trial, and high for seven trials. We assessed reporting bias risk as low for three trials and high for the remaining 14 trials. Corticosteroids significantly reduced mortality in adults with severe pneumonia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; moderate-quality evidence), but not in adults with non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.00). Early clinical failure rates (defined as death from any cause, radiographic progression, or clinical instability at day 5 to 8) were significantly reduced with corticosteroids in people with severe and non-severe pneumonia (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.7; and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83, respectively; high-quality evidence). Corstocosteroids reduced time to clinical cure, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, development of respiratory failure or shock not present at pneumonia onset, and rates of pneumonia complications. Among children with bacterial pneumonia, corticosteroids reduced early clinical failure rates (defined as for adults, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.70; high-quality evidence) based on two small, clinically heterogeneous trials, and reduced time to clinical cure. Hyperglycaemia was significantly more common in adults treated with corticosteroids (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14). There were no significant differences between corticosteroid-treated people and controls for other adverse events or secondary infections (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.93).

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroid therapy reduced mortality and morbidity in adults with severe CAP; the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome was 18 patients (95% CI 12 to 49) to prevent one death. Corticosteroid therapy reduced morbidity, but not mortality, for adults and children with non-severe CAP. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with more adverse events, especially hyperglycaemia, but the harms did not seem to outweigh the benefits.

### What is the role of steroids in pneumonia therapy? [^113mZio5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates the potential benefits as well as adverse effects from adjunctive therapy with systemic steroids in patients with pneumonia: either mild-to-moderate or severe, community-acquired or hospital-acquired, of bacterial or of viral origin (in particular H1N1 viral infection).

Recent Findings

Steroids potentially modulate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system in pneumonia. However, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies have repeatedly shown that steroids had no impact on survival, the clinical event of interest, but in severe pneumonia some studies pointed to potential harmful effect. In addition, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections, as well as increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the steroid-treated patients.

Summary

According to the current evidence, there are no data to support the well tolerated use of systemic steroids as a standard of care in pneumonia, neither in mild-to-moderate and severe, nor in bacterial and viral infection. Clinical and basic research should work together to improve trial designs to identify reliable surrogate markers of outcome, in particular of mortality. This may improve the patient selection and facilitate the identification of subgroups that can benefit from adjunctive steroid therapy.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^113WSa3S]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids on the outcomes of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and CINAHL search (1966 to November 2007) to identify full-text publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids in CAP.

Results

An initial literature search yielded 109 articles, and 105 studies were excluded after the first analysis. We found four studies eligible for analysis. On the basis of their results, the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP should be categorized as a weak recommendation (two studies) and a strong recommendation (two studies) with either low- or moderate-quality evidence. However, no evidence of adverse outcomes or harm is present in the evaluated studies.

Conclusion

According to the GRADE system, available studies do not support the recommendation of corticosteroids as a standard of care for patients with severe CAP. Further randomized controlled trials with this aim should enroll a larger number of severely ill patients. However, in patients needing corticosteroids, it may be reasonable to conclude that corticosteroid administration is safe in patients with severe infections receiving antimicrobial therapy.

### What is the best antimicrobial treatment for severe community-acquired pneumonia (including the role of steroids and statins and other immunomodulatory agents) [^113W3HqP]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. The mortality rate due to severe CAP has shown little improvement over the past few years, with a rate as high as 50% mainly in patients admitted to intensive care units. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Several therapies have been tested in patients with severe CAP in recent years. This article reviews recent data regarding different treatments including antimicrobials and adjunctive therapies in patients with severe CAP.

### Associated inflammatory response in pneumonia: role of adjunctive therapy with glucocorticoids [^1165PdkL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the potential use of glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in the management of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia or pulmonary infections of other etiologies.

Recent Findings

The importance of an adequate assessment of the inflammatory process and the appearance of inflammatory markers that correlate with the severity of pneumonia is underlined. A recent randomized clinical trial indicates that adjunctive treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia with glucocorticoids reduces complications and improves survival. The role of glucocorticoids in other lung infections is also reviewed. The design of new compounds with similar anti-inflammatory properties to classical glucocorticoids but with significantly fewer side effects constitutes a specific challenge for the near future.

Summary

Although adjunctive treatment with glucocorticoids in severe pneumonia is probably indicated, further randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm the preliminary positive results. In this regard, a proper evaluation of the inflammatory response is likely to be essential for the accurate selection of the target population.

### Corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: time to act! [^116y2USV]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with community-acquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

### Dexamethasone and length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112xp8WY]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether addition of corticosteroids to antibiotic treatment benefits patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are not in intensive care units is unclear. We aimed to assess effect of addition of dexamethasone on length of stay in this group, which might result in earlier resolution of pneumonia through dampening of systemic inflammation.

Methods

In our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned adults aged 18 years or older with confirmed community-acquired pneumonia who presented to emergency departments of two teaching hospitals in the Netherlands to receive intravenous dexamethasone (5 mg once a day) or placebo for 4 days from admission. Patients were ineligible if they were immunocompromised, needed immediate transfer to an intensive-care unit, or were already receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs. We randomly allocated patients on a one-to-one basis to treatment groups with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence in blocks of 20. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay in all enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00471640.

Findings

Between November, 2007, and September, 2010, we enrolled 304 patients and randomly allocated 153 to the placebo group and 151 to the dexamethasone group. 143 (47%) of 304 enrolled patients had pneumonia of pneumonia severity index class 4–5 (79 [52%] patients in the dexamethasone group and 64 [42%] controls). Median length of stay was 6.5 days (IQR 5.0–9.0) in the dexamethasone group compared with 7.5 days (5.3–11.5) in the placebo group (95% CI of difference in medians 0–2 days; p = 0.0480). In-hospital mortality and severe adverse events were infrequent and rates did not differ between groups, although 67 (44%) of 151 patients in the dexamethasone group had hyperglycaemia compared with 35 (23%) of 153 controls (p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Dexamethasone can reduce length of hospital stay when added to antibiotic treatment in non-immunocompromised patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^117SVaKT]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in developed countries. Patients with severe CAP often require intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. An exceedingly high mortality rate is observed in these patients despite significant advances in etiological investigation, antimicrobial therapy, and improvements in supportive care. With perhaps a few exceptions, adjunctive therapies for severe infections have failed to fulfill their promise in the past years.

Nevertheless, with the concept of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) and the results of clinical trials showing respiratory, immune, and hemodynamic benefits, corticosteroids have re-emerged as promising adjuncts for the treatment of severe sepsis. In the past years, several studies evaluated the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response as well as data on the adrenal function of patients with severe CAP. In addition, the administration of systemic corticosteroids is associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation in patients with bacterial pneumonia and acute lung injury and improved oxygenation and outcomes in patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Recent guidelines for the management of CAP suggest the benefit of systemic corticosteroids for patients with a severe presentation. Yet at the time of their publication, only data from a single small randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating improved survival were available. At present, few studies have addressed the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with CAP and their role is still unclear in this setting. In the present article, we reviewed recent peer-reviewed reports to determine whether systemic corticosteroids have an impact on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP. In addition, we explored possible explanations for the observed results.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114N7xbL]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and can result in significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic medical conditions. Despite developments in antimicrobial therapy and life-support measures for patients with sCAP, clinical outcomes have not improved significantly owing to an aging population, increased prevalence of comorbidities, and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant organisms. Therefore, the prevention and effective management of sCAP continue to be critical public health concerns.

In addition to early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the use of corticosteroids for the management of sCAP has been discussed in considerable detail. As numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the role of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of sCAP and yielded inconsistent findings, current guidelines provide different recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with sCAP. Furthermore, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with CAP; however, not all studies included in these meta-analyses focused on sCAP, and no consistent findings have been reported. In 2023, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that among patients with sCAP treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), treatment with hydrocortisone could result in a lower risk of 28-day mortality than those treated by a placebo. To address this controversy, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in patients with sCAP.

### Dexamethasone in COVID-19 treatment: analyzing monotherapy and combination therapy approaches [^1119xWvB]. Cytokine (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the exploration of effective treatment options, with dexamethasone emerging as a key corticosteroid for severe cases. This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone, highlighting its ability to reduce mortality rates, alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mitigate hyperinflammation. While dexamethasone shows therapeutic promise, potential adverse effects-including cardiovascular issues, neuropsychiatric complications, lung infections, and liver damage-necessitate careful monitoring and individualized treatment strategies. The review also addresses the debate over using dexamethasone alone versus in combination with other therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2, examining potential synergistic effects and drug resistance. In summary, dexamethasone is a valuable treatment option for COVID-19 but its risks highlight the need for tailored surveillance approaches. Further research is essential to establish clear guidelines for optimizing treatment and improving patient outcomes.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^115hu1Sb]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Few studies have evaluated the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). On the basis of their results, the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in severe CAP should be categorized as a weak recommendation (two studies) and a strong recommendation (two studies) with either low- or moderate-quality evidence.

- No evidence of adverse outcomes or harm is present in the studies that evaluated the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP. Thus, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma receiving antimicrobial therapy for severe CAP, concomitant administration of moderate doses of systemic corticosteroids may be considered safe.

- In view of the recent results of the CORTICUS (Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock) study, which evaluated the use of corticosteroids in septic shock, future randomized controlled trials should overcome the methodological flaws in the designs of the currently available studies. To determine the risks and benefits of adding corticosteroids to the treatment of patients with severe CAP, large prospective randomized studies involving a more homogeneous group of patients are necessary.

### The role of corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^117UaBXQ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Selection of participants, data collection, and definitions

We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and CINAHL (for the period of 1966 to November 2007) to identify full-text English language publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids in CAP. Inclusion criteria were established a priori. Major MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) search terms included 'community-acquired infections', 'pneumonia', 'steroids', 'corticosteroids', 'glucocorticoids', and 'cortisol'. We also reviewed the references of available studies for other potentially eligible studies, and additional published reports were identified through a manual search of citations from retrieved articles. Only original peer-reviewed clinical trials and cohort studies evaluating the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP were selected and analyzed. The abstracts of all articles were used to confirm our target population (patients with CAP), and the corresponding full-text articles were reviewed for the presence of data evaluating the outcomes of adult non-immunocompromised patients with severe CAP treated with systemic corticosteroids. Only studies of at least 20 adult patients were included. We excluded case reports, articles in which children were the subject of study, articles on CAP in HIV-infected patients, nosocomial pneumonia, or CAP managed in an outpatient setting. Two investigators (JIFS and PP) independently identified the eligible literature. Predefined variables were collected, including year of publication, study design (prospective/retrospective), number of patients included, and hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS), oxygenation, markers of systemic inflammation, and data on pneumonia severity. Additional unpublished data were obtained by electronic mail from Garcia-Vidal and Mikami. Any inconsistencies between the two investigators (JIFS and PP) in interpretation of data were resolved by consensus. The data were extracted to a standardized form and included the number of patients, hospital mortality and LOS, oxygenation, markers of systemic inflammation, and data on pneumonia severity. In addition, we explored possible reasons that may explain the results and assigned quality levels as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) GRADE system to formulate the level of recommendation.

### Corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: the path we choose depends on where we want to get [^1123CUW6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of admission to intensive care units and its mortality rates remain exceedingly high. In the search for adjunctive therapies, clinicians who were encouraged by available, though limited, evidence prescribed steroids in most patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, including those with community-acquired pneumonia. Current evidence demonstrates that, whereas corticosteroids should not be routinely employed as adjuvant therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, there is sufficient equipoise to continue studying the use of corticosteroids.

### Effect of corticosteroids on mortality and clinical cure in community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized control trials [^114RQ84x]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Corticosteroids may be a beneficial adjunct in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Research Question

Is there any benefit of corticosteroid therapy in the management of bacterial CAP among patients requiring hospitalization?

Study Design and Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify randomized controlled trials assessing the use of systemic corticosteroids compared with standard care in the management of CAP. A systematic review, meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) were performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, treatment failure, readmission, and adverse events. Data are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI, P value, heterogeneity (I²), and TSA-adjusted CIs.

Results

Sixteen trials met the eligibility criteria. All-cause mortality (16 studies [3,842 patients]; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.67–1.07]; p = 0.17; I² = 14%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.61–1.09), ICU admission (six studies [2,619 patients]; RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45–0.97]; p = 0.04; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.37–1.12), treatment failure (six studies [2,093 patients]; RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.37–1.67]; p = 0.52; I² = 68%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.02–25.5), and the incidence of adverse events (six studies [2,487 patients]; RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.97–1.25]; p = 0.14; I² = 53%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.82–2.41) were similar between patients receiving corticosteroids and patients assigned to the control group. The need for mechanical ventilation (eight studies [1,457 patients]; RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33–0.77]; p = 0.001; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.20–0.85) was lower among patients receiving corticosteroids compared with those receiving standard care. However, corticosteroid use may be associated with higher rates of hospital readmission (five studies [2,853 patients]; RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05–1.38]; p = 0.008; I² = 0%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.89–1.98).

Interpretation

Corticosteroid therapy is associated with a lower incidence of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with CAP. No association was found between corticosteroid therapy and mortality, treatment failure, or adverse events.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pfPij]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are an option in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the benefits and adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in severe CAP, have not been well assessed.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases from inception to May 2015 were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that evaluated use of corticosteroids in adult patients with CAP were included. The quality of outcomes was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs.

Results

Nine eligible RCTs (1,667 patients) and six cohort studies (4,095 patients) were identified. The mean corticosteroid dose and treatment duration were 30 mg/day methylprednisolone for 7 days. Corticosteroids did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low) in patients with CAP and patients with severe CAP (RCTs: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43–1.21; evidence rank, low; cohort studies: RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86–1.17). Corticosteroids treatment was associated with a decreased risk of ARDS (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.59) and may reduce lengths of hospital and ICU stay, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, and time to clinical stability. Corticosteroids were not associated with increased rates of adverse events.

Conclusions

Short-term treatment with corticosteroids is safe and may reduce the risk of ARDS, shortening the length of the disease in patients with CAP.

### Role of corticosteroid in the management of COVID-19: a systemic review and a clinician's perspective [^111sUjna]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Interest in corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 has been rekindled after the results from Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) Trial. However, the World health Organization has not recommended corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to conduct a systematic review on the role of corticosteroid in the management of patients of COVID-19.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented.

Results

Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases.

Conclusions

While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115mMXga]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Inpatient setting — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and corticosteroids: We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with nonsevere CAP (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe influenza pneumonia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in patients with CAP and refractory septic shock. Risk considerations note that the risk of corticosteroids in the dose range up to 240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent per day for a maximum of 7 days is predominantly hyperglycemia, with concerns about greater complications in the following 30 to 90 days.

### When should we use corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia? [^111SrWda]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to evaluate the evidence and recommendations for the prescription of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients.

Summary

According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^111NjCeu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The most appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a high-dose methylprednisolone versus a high-dose dexamethasone in hospitalized moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, regarding the WHO clinical progression scales, mortality, and the length of hospitalization.

Methods

In this open-labeled randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients with age > 18 years old who were diagnosed moderate COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by real-time PCR, evidence of pneumonia by chest imaging and resting oxygen saturation between 90 and 94%. Patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive methylprednisolone 250 mg/day or dexamethasone 20 mg/day over the first three days. Then the patients in both groups received dexamethasone 20 mg/day on days 4–5, and 10 mg/day on days 6–10. Primary outcome was assessed by a 10-point WHO clinical progression scales ranging from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 10) on the fifth day of treatment. Secondary outcomes including 90-day mortality, length of hospitalization, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and complications were determined.

Results

Of 98 eligible patients, the mean age was 76.0 ± 13.3 years. The median date of illness at the time of randomization was 3 days (interquartile range 2, 5). Baseline clinical characteristics and severity did not differ between groups. The WHO clinical progression scales were similar between methylprednisolone and dexamethasone group at 5 and 10 days of treatment [4.84, (95% confidence interval(CI), 4.35–5.33) vs. 4.76 (95% CI, 4.27–5.25), p = 0.821 and 4.32 (95% CI, 3.83–4.81) vs. 3.80 (95% CI, 3.31–4.29), p = 0.140, respectively)]. Both groups did not differ in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalization, and rate of ICU transfer. There were also no differences in steroid-related complications between groups until 90 days of follow-up.

Conclusions

In patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, initial anti-inflammatory treatment with 250 mg/day of methylprednisolone for three days does not yield better outcomes over high-dose dexamethasone.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Corticosteroids in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: a systematic review, pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis [^1136GLTA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines provide heterogenous guidance on use of corticosteroids for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials examining corticosteroids in hospitalized adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed a pairwise and dose-response meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology and the credibility of subgroups using the ICEMAN tool.

Results

We identified 18 eligible studies that included 4661 patients. Corticosteroids probably reduce mortality in more severe CAP (RR 0.62 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.85]; moderate certainty) with possibly no effect in less severe CAP (RR 1.08 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.42]; low certainty). We found a non-linear dose-response relationship between corticosteroids and mortality, suggesting an optimal dose of approximately 6 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) for a duration of therapy of 7 days (RR 0.44 [95% 0.30 to 0.66]). Corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42 to 74] and probably reduce intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.97]) (both moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of hospitalization and ICU stay (both low certainty). Corticosteroids may increase the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.76 [95% CI 1.46 to 2.14]) (low certainty).

Conclusion

Moderate certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids reduce mortality in patients with more severe CAP, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission.

### Corticosteroid therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^115pVbRX]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The debate about the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a longstanding dilemma. We performed a meta-analysis including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe CAP in adults.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished clinical trials. Databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane (from their establishment to July 2013), were searched for relevant articles. Only RCTs of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with severe CAP were selected.

Results

Four trials enrolling 264 patients with severe CAP were included. Use of corticosteroids significantly reduced hospital mortality compared with conventional therapy and placebo (Peto odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17–0.90). The quality of the evidence underlying the pooled estimate of effect on hospital mortality was low, downgraded for inconsistency and imprecision.

Conclusions

On the basis of the current limited evidence, we suggest that, although corticosteroid therapy may reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of adult patients with severe CAP, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the instability of pooled estimates. Reliable treatment recommendations will be raised only when large sufficiently powered multi-center RCTs are conducted.

### Biological effects of corticosteroids on pneumococcal pneumonia in mice-translational significance [^112fgJN4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, adjunctive therapy with both antibiotics and dexamethasone reduces the severity of hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and histologic evidence of lung injury in experimental pneumococcal pneumonia compared to antibiotics alone, in part through attenuating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, steroid therapy in combination with antibiotics does not increase bacterial burden in the early phase of pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Although the clinical studies were carried out in a modest number of patients, transcriptomic profiling further supports the clinical relevance of this mouse model, which replicates several features of pneumococcal pneumonia and steroid therapy in humans. In conclusion, steroid therapy has a sound mechanistic basis as an adjunctive treatment for severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia from S. Pneumoniae with the use of appropriate antibiotics.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LaX6J]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the reporting guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO.

Search strategy and study selection

We performed a comprehensive systematic search of the Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus databases for articles published between the database inception and April 24, 2023, using appropriate prespecified search terms: "community-acquired pneumonia", "corticosteroid", and "steroid". Only RCTs that assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of adult patients with sCAP were included. To identify relevant reports, we manually searched the reference lists of systematic and narrative reviews and studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included if the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) criteria were met: (a) Population: adult patients (i.e. 18 years of age or older) with sCAP; (b) Intervention: systemic corticosteroids were used regardless of the type of corticosteroid, duration of treatment, dosage, or route of administration (i.e. intervention group); (c) Comparison: placebo or standard care (i.e. control group), (d) Outcomes: mortality, the use of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of intensive care unit ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and the adverse events (AEs). In this study, sCAP was defined as CAP accompanied by requiring ICU admission, or meeting either the criteria for severe pneumonia by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) or classified as risk class V of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Only peer-reviewed RCTs were included in the analysis without restrictions on language, sample size, age, sex, ethnicity, or publication date.

We excluded studies that (1) focused on patients with septic shock; (2) reported data from post-hoc analysis; (3) were published only as conference posters, case series, case reports, or single-arm studies; (4) did not report outcomes of interest; or (5) were pharmacokinetic investigations.

Study selection

Two independent investigators (JYW and YWT) screened the titles and abstracts of the studies to identify potentially eligible studies. Full-text copies of the potentially relevant articles were obtained and reviewed for eligibility. In case of disagreement, a third investigator (WHH) was consulted.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^11744VaY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a potentially fatal pulmonary disease. Although studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for severe CAP, the results remain inconsistent. Moreover, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to rank the effects of different types of corticosteroids. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of different corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the treatment of severe CAP with corticosteroids were included. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, secondary efficacy outcome was mechanical ventilation (MV), and safety outcome was the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

A total of 11 studies, involving 2042 participants, compared four corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone). The included trials were all corticosteroid versus placebo comparisons, resulting in a star-shaped network. Among the four corticosteroids, only hydrocortisone was significantly more effective at reducing mortality than placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). Additionally, hydrocortisone reduced the need for MV (RR, 0.73; 95% CrI, 0.51–0.93). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that low-to-moderate doses, short-course corticosteroids are associated with a reduction in both mortality and the need for MV.

Conclusion

In the evaluated corticosteroid regimen, hydrocortisone might be an effective measure to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with severe CAP.

Clinical trial number

The present study is a meta-analysis and literature review, therefore clinical trial number is not applicable.

Dosing of corticosteroids for severe CAP — the 2017 SCCM/ESICM guideline recommended corticosteroids for 5–7 days at a daily dose < 400 mg IV hydrocortisone or equivalent, and the updated recommendation recognizes that multiple dosing strategies are acceptable for severe CAP and likely related to clinician discretion. Typical doses range from 40 to 80 mg/d IV methylprednisolone equivalent for a duration of 5–7 days, with one study including a prolonged taper over 20 days, and one guided by clinical criteria for 8 or 14 days; current evidence did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid duration and showed a possible subgroup interaction on mortality based on corticosteroid molecule.

Corticosteroid use is nevertheless common in hospitalized children with COVID-19, and there is reason to believe that the risk benefit ratio would be similar in children and adults.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111QYbg7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have primarily relied on direct meta-analyses, which can provide limited insight into the comparative effectiveness of different treatments. To overcome this limitation, this study employed network meta-analysis to enhance the precision of the results and enable a more comprehensive comparison of the efficacy of different corticosteroids. Despite these advances, our study had several limitations. First, the included RCTs varied in the diagnostic criteria for severe CAP and the definition and reporting of SAEs, which may have caused heterogeneity between the studies. Additionally, although corticosteroids may improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP, their immunosuppressive effects could theoretically increase the risk of secondary infections and antibiotic resistance. However, none of the included studies in our meta-analysis provided specific data on the incidence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens or secondary bacterial or fungal infections. This lack of data represents an important limitation, as the potential for increased susceptibility to nosocomial or opportunistic infections could offset the benefits of corticosteroid therapy. Future trials should incorporate comprehensive microbiological surveillance to assess this risk more precisely and guide safer clinical decision-making. Moreover, due to the limited number of qualifying RCTs, it was not feasible to conduct sensitivity analyses without compromising the integrity of the network structure, which, in turn, limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the optimal dosages and treatment durations for various corticosteroids. Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by heterogeneity across study populations, including variability in comorbidities, ICU admission status. Whether hydrocortisone provides comparable benefit across these diverse clinical subgroups remains uncertain and should be explored in future stratified analyses or individual patient data meta-analyses.

In summary, our study indicates that hydrocortisone significantly reduced mortality, whereas methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone did not exhibit the same effect. Furthermore, we confirmed the benefits of low-to-moderate doses and short-course corticosteroid therapy. While these findings may help guide clinical decision-making, they are not yet robust enough to warrant immediate changes to current treatment guidelines. To establish the optimal corticosteroid regimen, especially regarding the choice of agent, dose, and duration, further large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials are essential. Future research should particularly focus on direct head-to-head comparisons between hydrocortisone and other corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, to clarify their relative efficacy and safety profiles, and support the development of more precise, evidence-based treatment strategies.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — glucocorticoids: The guideline panel recommends dexamethasone for patients with critical COVID-19 and suggests dexamethasone for patients with severe COVID-19; if dexamethasone is not available, then alternative glucocorticoids may be used, and the guideline panel suggests against glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen. The panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with severe COVID-19 as moderate due to concerns with indirectness since the evidence was from dexamethasone, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence for patients without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen as low due to concerns with risk of bias (post hoc analysis) and imprecision. Additional research is needed to inform the generalizability of treatment with different glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ULE3m]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the effects of corticosteroids on the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of different corticosteroids on patients who were hospitalised for severe CAP.

Methods

We performed a systematic search through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2023. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Data analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 10 RCTs comprising 1962 patients were included. Corticosteroids were associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR), 0.70 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.90); I² = 0.00%). When stratified into different corticosteroid types, hydrocortisone was associated with an approximately 50% lower mortality risk (RR, 0.48 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.72); I² = 0.00%). However, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisolone were not associated with an improvement in mortality. Furthermore, hydrocortisone was associated with a reduction in the rate of mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and duration of intensive care unit stay. These trends were not observed for dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisolone. Corticosteroids were not associated with an increased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary infection or hyperglycaemia.

Conclusions

The use of hydrocortisone, but not other types of corticosteroids, was associated with a reduction in mortality and improvement in pneumonia outcomes among patients hospitalised with severe CAP.

### Corticosteroids for adult patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QpFWJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

International clinical practice guidelines addressing corticosteroid treatment for patients hospitalised with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of corticosteroids in hospitalised adult patients with suspected or probable CAP. We performed random effects pairwise, Bayesian, and dose-response meta-analyses using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) heterogeneity estimator. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology.

Results

We identified 30 eligible RCTs, including a total of 7519 patients. The prednisone-equivalent doses ranged between 29 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term (28–30 days) mortality (RR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74–0.91]; moderate certainty) while the reduction in longer term (60–90 day) mortality is less certain (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.76–1.03]; low certainty). Corticosteroids reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.48–0.82]; high certainty) and may reduce duration of ICU stay (MD 1.53 days fewer [95% CI 0.31–2.75 days fewer]; low certainty), and hospital stay (MD 2.30 days fewer [95% CI 0.81–3.81 days fewer]; low certainty). Corticosteroids probably increased hyperglycaemia requiring intervention (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.12–1.56]; moderate certainty) but probably have no effect on secondary infections (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85–1.11]; moderate certainty).

Conclusion

Corticosteroids probably reduced short-term mortality and reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with CAP.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112nK8t3]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with sCAP and demonstrated that systemic corticosteroids are associated with a better clinical outcome. First, based on the analysis of seven RCTs, additional corticosteroids for treating critically ill patients with sCAP were associated with a significantly lower mortality rate than placebo or usual care alone. A similar trend was observed in the leave-one-out sensitivity test. Secondly, lower mortality among sCAP patients receiving corticosteroids compared to the control group was consistently observed in most of the subgroup analyses, particularly for patients those aged 60 years or older, without initial septic shock, with ICU admission, use of hydrocortisone, and receiving corticosteroid for a duration of ≤ eight days and not undergoing corticosteroid tapering. Finally, patients receiving systemic corticosteroids had a lower risk of requiring further MV and shorter ICU and hospital stays than the control group. These findings indicate that adjunctive corticosteroids can improve the clinical outcomes of patients with sCAP and support their use in this clinical setting. Despite the guidelines recommending the use of corticosteroids in sCAP patients with septic shock, the majority of patients included in this meta-analysis did not have initial septic shock. The analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of adjunctive corticosteroids in these patients (Table 3). This finding further suggests that corticosteroids may have a role in the treatment of sCAP even in the absence of initial septic shock.

### Cytokines and cortisol-predictors of treatment response to corticosteroids in community-acquired pneumonia? [^11625v4U]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A previous study found community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients with imbalance of high inflammation and discordantly low cortisol levels to benefit most from adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. Our aim was to validate this hypothesis in a preplanned secondary analysis of the randomized controlled STEP trial.

Methods

Patients included in the STEP trial receiving 50 mg prednisone or placebo for 5 days were categorized based on pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-6/8/MCP-1), CRP and cortisol levels on admission into four groups (high/low inflammation and high/low cortisol). The primary combined end-point was mortality or ICU admission within 30 days.

Results

In total, 632 patients (315 prednisone, 317 placebo) were included in this analysis. Prednisone did not significantly reduce the risk for the primary end-point in patients with high cytokines/low cortisol and in any other subgroups. However, we noted some differences in the strength of corticosteroid effect in the different subgroups with stronger effects in patients with high cytokines [OR 0.44 (0.10,1.72)] compared to patients with low cytokines [OR 0.68 (0.30,1.5)] (P-interaction = 0.600). The effects did not differ according to cortisol levels.

Conclusion

The imbalance of high inflammation state and low cortisol levels did not predict treatment response to corticosteroids in patients with CAP. However, in line to previous research, inflammation as measured by cytokine levels irrespective of cortisol tended to predict treatment response to corticosteroids in CAP. Whether this concept may help to personalize corticosteroids to patients most likely benefitting from this treatment needs to be tested in future intervention trials.

### Final approval for corticosteroids in severe CAP? For sure, in septic shock [^114gKmAU]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of corticosteroids in the care of critically ill patients has been the subject of continuous research efforts with discrepant results. In sepsis, several "swings of the pendulum" for administering such drugs have occurred in the last two decades. A continuous and growing interest is in determining their role in a common source of sepsis: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients. Some studies in the last decade aimed to determine if corticosteroids resulted in a clinical benefit to the patients with the most severe clinical presentation and highest mortality of CAP: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP). Corticosteroids have already been shown to be beneficial in those with high systemic inflammatory response and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids may also be useful in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, who may have a more severe inflammatory response to sCAP. However, other studies have not found any significant benefit of corticosteroid therapy in CAP in mortality or treatment failure and have raised concerns about potential harm, including increased risk of secondary infections and delayed resolution for pneumonia.

Materials and methods

Search strategy and data sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science comprehensively, encompassing all publications with a search deadline of March 31, 2024, with no language restrictions, using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms related to community-acquired pneumonia and corticosteroids (including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). The search strategy was developed by an experienced researcher and is detailed in Table S1. In addition, we conducted a manual search of the references cited in the included studies to identify any other potentially relevant research. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024544342) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Study selection

The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) Population: Severe CAP; (2) Intervention: Corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, were administered at dosages designed to distinguish between low-to-moderate and high doses. Low-to-moderate doses were defined as < 1 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone or < 80 mg per day of methylprednisolone or its equivalent, whereas doses equal to or exceeding either threshold were classified as high doses; (3) Comparison: Placebo; (4) Outcomes: The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, the secondary efficacy outcome was MV, and the safety outcome was the incidence of SAEs; and (5) study design: RCTs. Severe CAP was defined as CAP that required admission to the ICU or met the criteria established by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA), or PaO2/FiO2 < 300, or pneumonia severity index score ≥ IV. Only data from the subgroup with severe CAP were included if the studies enrolled patients with different severity levels of CAP. In additionally, we excluded non-RCTs, duplicate publications, conference reports, and studies with incomplete data.

Two authors screened the study titles and abstracts to establish eligibility and conducted rigorous preliminary selection. Subsequently, the full text was reviewed based on the inclusion criteria, leading to further exclusion. Discrepancies were resolved by consulting with a third independent researcher.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted pertinent demographic data and study outcomes, including all-cause mortality, need for MV, and SAEs. Additionally, we categorized the included trials based on the treatment dosage and duration.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^116Hmoeb]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evidence to recommendation for CAP — there was general agreement among the panel for a credible subgroup effect demonstrating a large desirable treatment effect of corticosteroid use for patients with severe CAP with less magnitude of benefit in less severe CAP, and given this subgroup effect the panel decided to make separate recommendations for severe and nonsevere CAP. Overall, the panel felt that the balance of beneficial and undesirable effects favors giving corticosteroids to patients with more severe CAP but was uncertain in patients with less severe CAP; this judgment was driven in part by the CAPE COD randomized controlled trial (RCT), which represented approximately 35% of the severe CAP subgroup patients and showed a strong mortality benefit with the use of corticosteroids. Evidence informing cost-effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in CAP is lacking, though one study suggests cost savings with a more pronounced benefit in those with severe CAP; definitions for severe CAP and use of risk stratification scores are variable across RCTs. Although the panel considered a conditional recommendation against corticosteroids in less severe diseases, consensus was not achieved and further RCTs evaluating corticosteroids in less severe CAP are urgently needed. Of note, 2 of the 18 RCTs included in the analysis were done in low- to middle-income countries.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146CFHL]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a life-threatening form of pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality. In these patients, dysregulated lung and systemic inflammation can lead to sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and end-organ damage. Systemic corticosteroids downregulate proinflammatory cytokine production and have been hypothesised to mitigate systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction, leading to improved outcomes of severe pneumonia.

Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the mortality benefits of adjunctive corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP, but the results have been inconclusive. For example, in the ESCAPe (Extended Steroid in Use in Community Acquired Pneumonia) and Santeon-CAP (dexamethasone in community-acquired pneumonia) trials, the use of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone did not improve mortality risk in patients with severe CAP. However, the CAPE COD (community-acquired pneumonia: evaluation of corticosteroids) trial showed that hydrocortisone reduces all-cause mortality in patients with CAP admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).

Previous meta-analyses have attempted to address these inconsistencies by summarising evidence from RCTs, but the data have been conflicting. In aggregate-data meta-analyses conducted by Siemieniuk and colleagues and Wu and colleagues, corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in mortality in severe CAP. However, an individual patient data meta-analysis performed by Briel and colleagues showed no mortality benefits associated with corticosteroids in severe CAP. In a recent meta-analysis conducted by Pitre and colleagues, only hydrocortisone provided mortality benefits. However, this analysis included both severe and non-severe CAP. Based on prior data, corticosteroids were associated with subgroup effects based on disease severity. Therefore, an updated and focused meta-analysis is warranted to evaluate the effects of different corticosteroids on severe CAP. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different types of corticosteroids in patients who were hospitalised for severe CAP.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^114HPDhK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) was published by REMAP-CAP Investigators and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of hydrocortisone in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia? In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the population was: 658 patients (258 female, 400 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were residents of a nursing home or long-term care facility; inpatient in any healthcare facility within the last 30 days; imminent death; hypersensitivity to corticosteroids; chronic systemic corticosteroid use; lapse of > 24 hours since ICU admission. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the interventions were: n = 536 hydrocortisone (intravenous dose of 50 mg every 6 hours for 7 days) n = 122 no hydrocortisone (no course of corticosteroids). In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 90 (15% vs. 9.8%; OR 1.56, 95% CI 0 to 3.12). In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the REMAP-CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients admitted to the ICU with severe community-acquired pneumonia, hydrocortisone was not superior to no hydrocortisone with respect to death at day 90.

### Corticosteroid treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116mTsWk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence for adjunctive corticosteroids for severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-February 2007) and EMBASE (1980-February 2007) were searched to identify English- and French-language publications that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults. Major search terms included community-acquired pneumonia, intensive care unit, steroids, glucocorticoids, and adrenal cortex hormones.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical studies that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for CAP in adults were included. Clinical and surrogate markers of pneumonia were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Severe CAP is associated with an increase in pulmonary and circulatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha that may be associated with higher mortality. Corticosteroids suppress inflammatory reactions and prevent migration of inflammatory cells from the circulation to tissues by suppressing the synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. One observational comparative study and 2 randomized, controlled studies examined the effects of corticosteroid therapy at various doses on endpoints of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and clinical outcomes. One small observational pilot study revealed that methylprednisolone blunted some of the pulmonary and systemic markers of inflammation. One small, randomized, placebo-controlled study revealed that hydrocortisone had no significant effects on markers of pulmonary and systemic inflammation or clinical outcomes. Another small, randomized, placebo-controlled preliminary study with methodological limitations revealed improvements in oxygenation, organ dysfunction score, and markers of inflammation favoring hydrocortisone over placebo.

Conclusions

Given the lack of proven benefit on clinically meaningful endpoints and adverse events, corticosteroids cannot be recommended for adjunctive treatment of severe CAP.

### Biomarkers define the clinical response to dexamethasone in community-acquired pneumonia [^114rnAqL]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Adjuvant dexamethasone treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can reduce length of hospital stay. Whether there are subgroups of patients that especially might benefit from corticosteroids is unknown. We hypothesized that a discrepancy between systemic inflammation and cortisol level can define a subgroup that lacks a sufficient cortisol response during CAP, and therefore particularly might benefit from corticosteroids.

Methods

A secondary analysis was performed on data from hospitalized patients with CAP, randomized to a four-day course of dexamethasone (5 mg daily) or placebo. Subgroups were made based on plasma cytokine levels (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)) and total plasma cortisol on presentation. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were assessed.

Results

275 Patients (131 dexamethasone, 144 placebo) were analyzed. In the subgroup of patients (n = 23) with a high cytokine response (IL-6 ≥ 92.5 pg/mL, IL-8 ≥ 14.8 pg/mL and MCP-1 ≥ 1154.5 pg/mL) and a discrepantly low cortisol (lowest 50%), dexamethasone treatment was associated with a significant decrease on a combined endpoint of mortality/ICU admission, as compared with placebo (0% vs. 43%, p < 0.01). In the subgroup of patients with a high cytokine response and high cortisol (n = 23), this favorable effect of dexamethasone was absent (30% vs. 39%, p: 0.67).

Conclusions

In CAP patients presenting with a high pro-inflammatory cytokine response but a discrepantly low cortisol, adjuvant dexamethasone treatment was associated with a significant decrease in mortality/ICU admission.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^113ydXL9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Possible benefits include amelioration of organ damage secondary to excessive host inflammatory responses via their anti-inflammatory properties, or mitigation of septic shock via their effects on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis. Corticosteroids lowered mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, in a recent study of severe CAP, and in a post hoc analysis of CAP patients in a larger trial of steroids for septic shock. A recent guideline statement now recommends corticosteroid administration for severe CAP. However, other studies yielded inconsistent results, corticosteroids carry known side effects, and uncertainty persists regarding the type and dose of corticosteroids and whether treatment should be given broadly or to particular subgroups of patients.

REMAP-CAP is an ongoing international platform trial (NCT02735707) designed to evaluate treatments for patients with severe CAP in pandemic and non-pandemic settings. The REMAP-CAP investigators previously reported that hydrocortisone appeared to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, administered either as a fixed-dose 1-week course or titrated depending on the presence and duration of shock. REMAP-CAP also contains a corticosteroid domain for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, where patients were randomized to one of several corticosteroid strategies or control. On December 6th, 2023, the platform ceased randomization to one of the corticosteroid strategies, fixed-duration hydrocortisone, on the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) after that arm triggered a pre-specified stopping rule for futility compared to control (no corticosteroid). Data were locked after the last patient completed follow-up for the primary end point and the results are presented here.

Conclusions

Among patients with severe CAP, treatment with a 7-day fixed-duration course of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, appears unlikely to yield a large reduction in mortality. Smaller benefits and possible harm are not excluded.

### Biological effects of corticosteroids on pneumococcal pneumonia in mice-translational significance [^112VHw5y]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study addresses several important gaps in our knowledge regarding the effects of corticosteroid treatment for bacterial pneumonia in the lungs. Few studies have directly evaluated the mechanistic effects of corticosteroids in an experimental model of pneumococcal pneumonia, a particularly important issue in view of the recent clinical trials reporting improved outcomes in patients with severe community acquired pneumonia when treated with corticosteroids. Although patients recognized to have bacterial pneumonia are uniformly treated with antibiotics, animal models using bacterial pathogens do not routinely include the use of antibiotics, which limits their clinical relevance. This study identifies several mechanisms by which dexamethasone decreases lung injury in mice with pneumococcal pneumonia treated the antibiotics and supports the biological relevance of this model to humans.

Dexamethasone improved oxygenation, decreased pulmonary edema, and decreased histological evidence of lung injury when added to antibiotics. These results are consistent with recent clinical studies, in which early administration of dexamethasone reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients and reduced the progression to mechanical ventilation in non-intubated patients with severe pneumonia. Assessment of BAL fluid identified that the combination of antibiotics and dexamethasone reduced protein permeability and leukocyte accumulation into the distal air spaces. In contrast to the favorable effect on protein permeability, dexamethasone did not enhance alveolar fluid clearance, indicating that the favorable effects of dexamethasone combined with antibiotics were explained by a reduction in the formation of pulmonary edema, not by an increase in the rate of alveolar fluid clearance.

Because of their immunosuppressive effects, steroids can impair host bacterial clearance. In one mouse study using a very early administration of glucocorticoids (one hour after infection), high dose dexamethasone increased bacterial burden in the lung. In contrast, dexamethasone did not impair host bacterial clearance in the current study, possibly because dexamethasone was given 20 h after infection and at the same time antibiotic therapy was initiated. We selected this schedule in part to enhance the clinical relevance of the model, as patients with pneumonia usually come to medical attention when their infection has progressed enough to cause symptoms. These findings are consistent with the results of some recent clinical trials of steroids in COVID-19 ARDS, non-COVID ARDS, and meta-analyses of steroid use in community-acquired pneumonia, in which steroid administration provided clinical benefit in patients with pneumonia of differing etiologies but was not associated with significantly higher rates of secondary infection.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Bzxxq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Overall, the clinical benefits associated with corticosteroids in patients with severe CAP appeared to be driven by the positive effects of hydrocortisone. Whether this finding represents a class effect in that only hydrocortisone provides outcome benefits in severe CAP or a difference between studies was not entirely clear. In most of the included studies, hydrocortisone was dosed at 200 mg/day, which was similar in terms of equivalent dosing in other corticosteroid groups. In our subgroup analyses, mortality outcomes did not differ based on the doses of corticosteroids given to patients. Therefore, the differences in mortality benefits between different corticosteroids were unlikely to be related to dose differences. We explored the effects of geography and risk of bias on all-cause mortality and did not find a difference in outcomes between studies performed in different geographical regions and studies with a low versus high risk of bias. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that focused on ICU patients as the clinical effects of corticosteroids were thought to have greater benefits in patients admitted immediately to the ICU than those admitted to the regular wards. In this sensitivity analysis, corticosteroids, and primarily hydrocortisone, showed a trend towards a reduction in all-cause mortality among patients admitted to the regular wards, similar to the primary analysis. Therefore, the mortality benefits of hydrocortisone on severe CAP may be generalised to the non-ICU population. Given these findings, patients who were not admitted to the ICU but fulfilling severe CAP criteria may be considered for hydrocortisone treatment.

Hydrocortisone is a short-acting glucocorticoid with low potency. By contrast, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone are longer acting glucocorticoids with higher potency than hydrocortisone. Mechanistically, hydrocortisone may modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation without excessive immune activation, whereas other corticosteroids may lead to prolonged immunosuppression, potentially hindering the host response against infection. Thus, hydrocortisone's shorter duration of action and lower potency may allow for anti-inflammatory effects without significant immunosuppression, contributing to its observed mortality benefits in severe CAP. Furthermore, hydrocortisone acts as a glucocorticoid with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects, whereas dexamethasone and methylprednisone, being synthetic glucocorticoids, predominantly exert glucocorticoid effects with minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Mineralcorticoid plays a pivotal role in regulating sodium and potassium balance. This dual effect of hydrocortisone, encompassing both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid actions, may confer unique therapeutic advantages, particularly in the context of severe CAP, where maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure is crucial during heightened stress conditions.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^112aHF5s]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) constitutes a potentially fatal pulmonary infection that significantly affects healthcare resources and has high morbidity and mortality. Dysregulation of pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses can lead to extensive tissue damage, progression to sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure. Corticosteroids exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the excessive production of inflammatory mediators, which may reduce the risk of severe lung injury, ARDS, multiple organ failure, and subsequent death.

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in treating severe CAP have been investigated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, the results remain controversial. The Santeon-CAP trial demonstrated that dexamethasone reduced the ICU admission rate for patients in the severe CAP subgroup, although it did not improve 30-day mortality. Conversely, the ESCAPe trial showed that low-dose methylprednisolone shortened the length of mechanical ventilation (MV) required for patients but did not yield positive results in terms of 60-day mortality. However, the CAPE COD trial results indicated that hydrocortisone significantly lowered the 28-day mortality among patients with severe CAP in the ICU.

Previous studies have investigated the effects of corticosteroids on severe CAP, but the data and results have been conflicting, particularly regarding mortality outcomes. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated a correlation between corticosteroid use and decreased mortality, as well as reduced requirements for MV among these patients. However, meta-analyses conducted by Briel and colleagues suggested that corticosteroids failed to improve survival rates in severe CAP. In contrast, a systematic review by Huang and colleagues found that treatment with prednisolone or methylprednisolone reduced mortality, whereas hydrocortisone did not exhibit such an effect. However, recent meta-analyses have suggested that only hydrocortisone can reduce mortality. The central challenges remain in identifying the optimal types, dosages, and durations of corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, the scarcity of direct comparative RCTs assessing the effects of corticosteroids complicates these findings. Consequently, we conducted a network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different types of corticosteroids for severe CAP.

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117D6Hou]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results provided by this double-blind, randomised trial of CAP patients admitted to a general hospital ward and presenting severe respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations support the hypothesis that an adjuvant steroid therapy decreases the inflammatory response, and seems to reduce the need for MV. This experience supports the need for larger studies in order to establish the usefulness of this therapeutic strategy in the different kinds of CAP.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^117HweE8]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide despite correct antibiotic use. Severe disease not only manifests frequently and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, but also presents with the highest mortality. Death in severe CAP occurs due to an overwhelming pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that causes abnormal gas exchange (i.e. respiratory failure), sepsis, and multiple-organ dysfunction. Although antimicrobials are highly effective at reducing the bacterial burden of pulmonary infection, they do not directly modulate the inflammatory response.

Poor clinical outcomes in severe CAP necessitate treatment strategies other than antibiotics. Corticosteroids are a biologically plausible option that inhibit the expression and action of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response associated with pneumonia. However, their use in CAP has yielded heterogeneous survival results in randomized clinical trials, in part because they included patients with and without severe CAP, precluding their routine inclusion in therapeutic strategies. Appropriate selection of patients with severe CAP only, in whom the beneficial effects of corticosteroids outweigh the potential adverse effects, is therefore of major relevance. Indeed, subgroup analyses of patients treated for CAP with corticosteroids have shown survival benefits mainly in those with severe disease. This is plausible because the low mortality in patients without severe CAP makes it less likely that we will observe reduced mortality. Given that the rationale for corticosteroid use is to attenuate the inflammatory response, those with the highest inflammatory status should obtain the most benefit. In a randomized clinical trial of patients with severe CAP and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, corticosteroid use led to less late radiographic progression of pulmonary opacities. However, this study was underpowered for assessing differences in mortality and other clinical outcomes.

We hypothesize that corticosteroids might improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe CAP and high inflammatory responses by reducing pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Accordingly, we aimed to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and other outcomes in patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response.

### Impact of different corticosteroids on severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tVfws]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

All-cause mortality

All studies (1962 patients) reported on outcomes in all-cause mortality. Corticosteroids were associated with a 30% lower rate of all-cause mortality compared with placebo (RR, 0.70 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.90); I² = 0.00%) (figure 2). The mortality benefits varied according to the type of corticosteroid used. Patients receiving hydrocortisone had an approximately 50% lower mortality risk as compared with placebo (RR, 0.48 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.72); I² = 0.00%). On the other hand, patients receiving dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisolone did not experience a reduction in mortality. There is no publication detected on the funnel plot (online supplemental figure 1).

Figure 2
Forest plot summarising the effects of corticosteroids on all-cause mortality. Note: The inconsistency index (I²) statistic indicates the extent of inter-study heterogeneity.

Mechanical ventilation

Six studies (763 patients) reported on outcomes in mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids were associated with about 50% lower rate of mechanical ventilation compared with placebo (RR, 0.54 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.67); I² = 0.00%) (online supplemental figure 2). Patients who received hydrocortisone experienced an approximately 50% reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.54 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.69); I² = 0.00%), whereas patients who received methylprednisolone did not experience this reduction (RR, 0.44 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.10); I² = 0.00%).

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

Four studies (666 patients) reported on the outcome of ARDS. Corticosteroids were associated with a 55% lower rate of ARDS compared with placebo, but this risk reduction was not statistically significant (RR, 0.45 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.43); I² = 40.49%) (online supplemental figure 3). Patients who received hydrocortisone experienced a 77% reduction in ARDS (RR, 0.23 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.82); I² = 3.46%), whereas patients who received methylprednisolone did not experience this reduction (RR, 1.14 (95% CI 0.46 to 2.83)).

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU corticosteroid evidence and dosing: Across 1,703 COVID-19 patients, the use of corticosteroids reduced the risk of 28-day mortality compared to no corticosteroids or placebo (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; high quality), with similar results in mechanically ventilated patients (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82; moderate quality), translating to 96 fewer deaths (95% CI 142 fewer to 47 fewer) per 1,000 patients receiving corticosteroids; the effect size for 28-day mortality was largest in trials using dexamethasone for up to 10 days (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.82; moderate quality), followed by hydrocortisone (374 patients, OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.12, low quality) and methylprednisolone (47 patients, OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, very low quality), and a firm conclusion on comparative efficacy cannot be made; the effect of late administration in mechanically ventilated patients remains unclear, and the optimal dosing and duration are unclear, so until more evidence is available, we prefer using the dosing regimen from the RECOVERY trial (i.e., dexamethasone 6 mg/day for 10 days or equivalent); serious adverse events were variably reported and corticosteroids have a range of adverse effects, with several studies in viral pneumonia patients in the ICU showing increased or prolonged coronavirus RNA shedding with corticosteroid use and the clinical consequences of increased shedding uncertain because effects on duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital and ICU length of stay were not reported.

Results

The initial literature search yielded 109 articles. One hundred four studies were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. One article was excluded after revision for involving both patients with CAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The complete flow diagram and reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure 1. Eventually, we selected four studies that evaluated the use of corticosteroids for severe CAP. These studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Two studies found a significant reduction in mortality for patients with severe CAP treated with corticosteroids. The study of Confalonieri and colleagues, a small-sized (n = 46) multicenter RCT, showed an impressive reduction in hospital mortality (30% versus 0%; P = 0.009) with a 7-day continuous infusion of hydrocortisone (240 mg/day). Garcia-Vidal and colleagues evaluated 308 patients in a large retrospective single-center cohort study and demonstrated in a multivariate analysis that the use of corticosteroids was strongly associated with a lower mortality (hospital mortality; odds ratio, 0.287; 95% confidence interval, 0.113 to 0.732). These patients were treated with a median dose of 45 mg/day of methylprednisolone for a mean period of 11.4 days. In a small open-label RCT evaluating 31 patients hospitalized for CAP, no mortality benefit was observed in patients receiving a 3-day course of 40 mg of prednisolone as compared with placebo. Marik and colleagues evaluated the effects on clinical course of a single dose of hydrocortisone administered to patients (n = 30) with severe CAP 30 minutes before antibiotic therapy. In this small RCT, no improvement in survival was observed.

The study RECOVERY (dexamethasone) was published by RECOVERY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19? In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the population was: 6425 patients (2338 female, 4087 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were unavailability of dexamethasone, clinical judgement of patients' unsuitability for randomization. In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the interventions were: n = 2104 dexamethasone therapy (oral or IV dexamethasone for up to 10 days) n = 4321 no dexamethasone (standard of care). In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 28 days (22.9% vs. 25.7%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93). In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in discharge from hospital within 28 days (12 vs. 13; RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) Significant decrease in invasive mechanical ventilation (5.7% vs. 7.8%; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95). In the RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, dexamethasone therapy was superior to no dexamethasone with respect to death at 28 days.

### The effect of corticosteroids on mortality of patients with influenza pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113g534B]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in patients with influenza pneumonia remains controversial. We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on mortality in adult patients with influenza pneumonia by comparing corticosteroid-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Science databases were searched for all controlled studies that compared the effects of corticosteroids and placebo in adult patients with influenza pneumonia. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS), and the rate of secondary infection.

Results

Ten trials involving 6548 patients were pooled in our final analysis. Significant heterogeneity was found in all outcome measures except for ICU LOS (I² = 38%, P = 0.21). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30~2.36, Z = 3.71, P = 0.0002), longer ICU LOS (mean difference [MD] 2.14, 95% CI 1.17~3.10, Z = 4.35, P < 0.0001), and a higher rate of secondary infection (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.04~3.78, Z = 2.08, P = 0.04) but not MV days (MD 0.81, 95% CI -1.23~2.84, Z = 0.78, P = 0.44) in patients with influenza pneumonia.

Conclusions

In patients with influenza pneumonia, corticosteroid use is associated with higher mortality.

### Efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dV5xB]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a primary contributor to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among hospitalized patients, especially in individuals aged 65 years and older. In 2019, the global mortality rate of LRTI was 6.46 per 100,000 individuals. Over the past 30 years (1990–2019), the mortality rate showed a decreasing trend among individuals aged ≥ 55 years; however, it increased by 85.84% in absolute terms, with the highest rates observed in patients aged ≥ 85 years. Additionally, patients with clinical failure (CF) after CAP treatment are generally older than those with clinical success, with a reported CF incidence of 13.1% in older adult patients with CAP. Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP), characterized by the requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or hemodynamic support, has a mortality rate of 16–36%. sCAP is prevalent among older adults who often have immunosuppression and age-related comorbidities, leading to poor clinical outcomes despite timely and adequate antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroid therapy, which attenuates local and systemic inflammatory responses, has been proposed as an adjunctive treatment to improve the outcomes of patients with sCAP. However, glucocorticoids are associated with numerous adverse effects, necessitating caution when prescribing them to older adults in distinct patient populations. Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid treatment in older adult patients with sCAP is essential. Currently, international guidelines lack specific treatment recommendations for older adult patients with sCAP, and conflicting guidelines on corticosteroid use in patients with severe CAP are available. Over the past decade, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a mean patient age > 60 years have examined the efficacy of glucocorticoids for sCAP. Some studies have indicated beneficial outcomes; however, the overall conclusions remain inconclusive. A 2023 meta-analysis incorporating recent studies reported that corticosteroid use in adult patients with sCAP was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, shorter hospital stays, and favorable safety profiles. However, it remains unclear whether these effects extend to older patients with sCAP. To investigate this, we performed a meta-analysis of both domestic and international RCTs involving patients with a mean age > 60 years to assess the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid treatment in older individuals with sCAP.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112wePkW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are well-known and readily available anti-inflammatory medications that much evidence has shown to be effective in COVID-19 patients. Based on the RECOVERY trial, a medium-dose regimen (6 mg of DXM once daily) was beneficial only for COVID-19 patients who received respiratory support or had inflammation that required control. Subsequently, several studies reported that a high-dose to pulse regimen was also beneficial in COVID-19 patients with severe and critical illnesses and appeared to improve outcomes more than a medium-dose regimen. Based on the evidence, three main factors should be considered to predict the advantage of systemic corticosteroids: (1) degree of inflammation, (2) dose of corticosteroids, and (3) drug tissue concentration.

Firstly, COVID-19 patients who manifest severe to critical illness or meet hyperinflammatory response conditions will deteriorate as these conditions indicate that anti-inflammatory treatment is required to mitigate the inflammatory process. This is important not only in the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia but also ARDS in the terminal phase of infection to lessen inflammation and tissue injury. In the early stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, the timing of administration is determined by the benefit of inflammation control over the risk of prolonged viral shedding, which has to be discussed. Studies by Raef Fadel et al. and Pablo Monedero et al. have shown that early (within 48 h) corticosteroids use in moderate to critically ill patients results in lower mortality, shorter stays in ICU, decreased organ dysfunction, and fewer days on MV. Secondly, the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids depends on their dose categorized by mg of prednisolone equivalent dose per day: low-dose (≤ 7.5 mg), medium-dose (> 7.5 mg and ≤ 30 mg), high-dose (> 30 mg), very high-dose (> 100 mg), and pulse therapy (≥ 250 mg). Corticosteroids have a dual action pathway: they inhibit inflammation through genomic and non-genomic pathways. The treatment regimen, which involved a prednisolone equivalent dose exceeding 100 mg, demonstrated significant non-genomic potency, contributing to rapidly suppressing the inflammation. It was proven in a triple-blind RCT by Keivan Ranjbar et al. that a very high-dose regimen was more effective than a medium-dose one (as in the RECOVERY trial) for patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, it does not increase the risk of infections that most studies have reported. Thirdly, MP might have contributed to better outcomes because of its tendency to concentrate in lung tissue more than DXM. In COVID-19, however, no clinical trial has been established to support this issue.

### Potential health and economic impacts of dexamethasone treatment for patients with COVID-19 [^113xbuRR]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and is either asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in most individuals. However, a significant number of individuals, especially among the elderly, develop a more severe form of the disease and require hospital care. A further subset of these patients requires oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance, creating a high demand for long-term hospital care in intensive care units (ICUs). In the UK, between 6 February and 18 April 2020, the case fatality rate among those admitted to hospital with COVID-19 was more than 26%; this increased to more than 37% in patients who required mechanical ventilation. An extensive search for potential drugs with which to treat COVID-19 is underway. Dexamethasone has emerged as a standout therapeutic candidate, reducing mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Thus, the adoption of a dexamethasone treatment protocol for patients requiring respiratory support could potentially lead to a significant number of lives saved over the course of the pandemic between July and December 2020.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111PsGUe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 2042 patients with severe CAP, we aimed to determine the optimal corticosteroid regimen. Hydrocortisone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). While this finding is statistically significant, its clinical relevance requires further consideration. Traditionally, overreliance on p-values and SUCRA rankings may lead to overlooking the practical implications of therapeutic interventions in clinical settings. SUCRA values reflect relative rankings rather than absolute clinical benefit and should be interpreted with caution. To address these, Horita et al. recently proposed a framework for the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which is applicable to effect sizes such as RR. According to this framework, an RR of 0.35 is not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful, demonstrating a substantial mortality benefit. Further comparative analysis suggested that hydrocortisone may outperform methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone in reducing mortality. Additionally, our results indicate that patients may benefit more from corticosteroids administered in low-to-moderate doses and over short courses.

Previous direct meta-analyses have investigated the effect of corticosteroids on severe CAP, but the results remain inconclusive. Our network meta-analysis revealed that unlike other corticosteroids, hydrocortisone not only significantly reduced mortality, but also reduced the need for MV. These findings underscore the distinct advantages of hydrocortisone in improving patient prognosis. Importantly, owing to the absence of direct comparative RCTs between different corticosteroids, our analysis provides critical insights suggesting that hydrocortisone may be more effective in reducing mortality and MV. Evidence credibility was rated as very low to low for outcomes including all-cause mortality, MV, and SAEs, primarily due to concerns regarding incoherence, heterogeneity, and imprecision. These limitations warrant cautious interpretation of hydrocortisone's potential benefits and highlight the need for well-designed, adequately powered head-to-head RCTs to validate these findings.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia: the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial [^115PHSuf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In exploratory analysis, it is possible that hydrocortisone reduced the duration of vasopressor requirement. This finding is consistent with two international trials of hydrocortisone in septic shock, CORTICUS and ADRENAL, both of which reported no reduction in mortality but faster resolution of shock. Both the anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular effects of hydrocortisone could explain the short-term ameliorating effects on shock. Why an improvement in the resolution of shock would not improve longer-term outcome is more complicated: patients with severe CAP have multiple factors that contribute to their risk of death, and steroids have pleiotropic effects, of which some may ameliorate and others aggravate patients' risk factors. More broadly, CAP is extremely heterogenous, and the effect of steroids may vary across patients, both within this trial and between trials, possibly explaining some of the discrepancies. Furthermore, some of this heterogeneity may be related to features that can be difficult to quantify accurately, such as the severity of the inflammatory response, degree and nature of underlying comorbidities, causative pathogen, host–pathogen interactions, and the time in the course of CAP at which patients present to hospital.

Limitations

This study has important limitations. First, the futility rule that stopped the study may have been premature. It only ruled out a relatively large effect (> 20% relative reduction in mortality), and the sample size was too small to explore subgroup effects. In particular, the limited number of patients in the influenza strata preclude any conclusions about the effect of steroids in these patients. Second, the open-label design meant clinicians were aware of the treatment assignment, which likely influenced their decision to prescribe corticosteroids in some control arm patients, although typically for a much shorter course. If steroids were beneficial, their use in the control arm would have reduced the effect size, but would be unlikely to cause futility and possible harm. Third, a miscoding error prior to the first adaptive analysis led to erroneous updated response-adaptive randomization proportions, which led more patients to be assigned to the fixed-duration hydrocortisone intervention. Though the miscoding may have caused fewer patients to be allocated to receive the optimal treatment, it is unlikely to have changed the overall outcome, as evidenced by the consistent findings across the sensitivity analyses. Fourth, one of the exclusion criteria, chronic corticosteroid therapy was not defined prospectively but by the physician in charge of the patient.

### Real-world corticosteroid use in severe pneumonia: a propensity-score-matched study [^111mS2su]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The mortality benefits of corticosteroid treatment for CAP, as previously reported in a meta-analysis, only appear to be observed in the most severely ill patients who have a high inflammatory response in real-world settings. In the absence of patients with severe CAP having an IMV requirement or developing septic shock, corticosteroids are not associated with lower mortality.

### Lower mortality risk associated with remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^114EFJ14]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Evolving evidence generated during later stages of the pandemic shows a lack of benefit, or even harm of dexamethasone monotherapy in patients not receiving oxygen. Remdesivir + dexamethasone was associated with a significant survival benefit as compared to dexamethasone monotherapy in patients not receiving supplemental oxygen. This new finding strongly suggests that viral clearance delay is likely the reason for worse survival outcomes with dexamethasone in the early course of COVID-19 (before patients require supplemental oxygen), and that this may be mitigated by the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Nevertheless, this finding should not be used to encourage the use of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 without hypoxemia in the absence of a compelling indication for steroids for a reason unrelated to COVID-19. A natural extrapolation of these data, however, is that when there is chronic preexisting use of glucocorticoids, the addition of remdesivir may attenuate the risk conferred by glucocorticoids in the COVID-19 population without hypoxemia. This finding of significantly lower mortality risk across all respiratory support levels in patients receiving remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone matches not only the expected biologic course of the infection (faster viral clearance leads to short disease duration and improved survival) but is also highly consistent with all infectious disease evidence in which steroids' survival benefits are only present when given together with antimicrobials in severe infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and septic shock where steroid monotherapy is never recommended. Furthermore, our study suggests that it is important to target the SARs-CoV-2 virus directly, especially in this endemic era when hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are likely to have significant comorbidities and be at higher risk of developing severe disease.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^113FdM4u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrocortisone is a low-potency, short-acting corticosteroid that offers distinct clinical advantages over more potent, long-acting agents such as prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. The pathogenesis of severe CAP typically involves a hyperinflammatory response, characterized by a cytokine storm, which leads to alveolar epithelial damage and impaired oxygen exchange. Hydrocortisone inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by glucocorticoid receptors, selectively reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby alleviating pulmonary tissue damage. By providing moderate immunomodulation, it prevents excessive immunosuppression and lowers the risk of secondary infections. Additionally, the short half-life of hydrocortisone allows for dynamic dosage adjustments according to disease progression, reducing adverse effects such as hyperglycemia and muscle atrophy. This makes it especially suitable for critically ill patients who require meticulous management. Hydrocortisone does not require hepatic metabolic activation, making it suitable for severe CAP patients with impaired liver function, offering higher safety and more predictable pharmacological responses. Notably, hydrocortisone has dual glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity, which enables it to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, providing crucial hemodynamic support while reducing reliance on vasopressor agents. In summary, hydrocortisone achieves the optimal balance between efficacy and safety in the treatment of severe CAP and holds promise as an ideal option for personalized therapy in severe pneumonia.

In addition to focusing on the clinical benefits of corticosteroids, physicians should also be aware of their potential side effects. This study evaluated SAEs associated with corticosteroid use in severe CAP, including opportunistic infections, cardiac events, neuropsychiatric symptoms, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hyperglycemia. The results indicate that corticosteroids do not significantly increase the risk of SAEs, which is consistent with previous research. However, larger, well-designed studies are warranted to confirm their long-term safety profile.

Guidelines from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend the use of corticosteroids for moderate to severe ARDS within 14 days of onset. However, the evidence of severe CAP with corticosteroids remains complex and contradictory. The CAPE COD trial notably supported corticosteroid use and demonstrated that hydrocortisone significantly reduces mortality. Despite these findings, determining the optimal type, dosage, and duration of corticosteroids still unresolved. Our analysis assessed the effects of high and low-to-moderate doses and long and short courses of treatment on mortality, MV, and SAEs. The aggregated results suggest that low-to-moderate doses and short courses of treatment are more effective in reducing mortality. These observations provide a preliminary basis for therapeutic refinement and underscore the need for additional RCTs to develop definitive guidelines.

### Correspondence about the article "Effect of hydrocortisone on mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain randomized clinical trial" [^116iXFrS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adaptive platform trials represent an elegant opportunity to test multiple interventions for the same disease, and the considerable work of the REMAP-CAP consortium to evaluate multiple promising treatments for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be commended. However, the recent publication of the fixe-duration hydrocortisone domain raises a few questions. First, due to the open-label nature of the trial, 23% of patients randomized to the standard-of-care group nevertheless received corticosteroids for a median duration of 4 days. We agreed that it is unlikely that this breach of protocol could have alone reversed the result. However, the median duration of hydrocortisone treatment was only 5 days in the CAPE COD trial, which demonstrated a benefit of hydrocortisone administration. A per-protocol analysis would usefully refine the mortality rate at day 90, according to the treatment received. Second, 658 patients were randomized in 101 centers across 18 countries. It is certainly desirable that patients included in a trial reflect the diversity of their countries' healthcare systems and income levels. However, this can make it difficult to ensure that the standard-of-care was the same in both groups. Little is known about treatments other than corticosteroids, with a possible imbalance between groups that may have been favored by the open-label nature of the trial. Third, on average, each center included 6.5 patients, but it is likely that a large number of centers included only a few patients. An analysis of previous intensive care trials showed an interaction between the effect of treatment and the sequence in which the patient was included. The first or first two patients enrolled at each center had higher mortality rates than subsequent patients, were treated later, and were exposed to more protocol violations. The decision to include a very large number of centers could therefore be counterproductive, especially when there are many domains of inclusion, which could result in a low volume for each one. Fourth, as highlighted by the authors, some important characteristics of patients at baseline appear to be unevenly distributed between the groups. Patients in the hydrocortisone group were slightly older, were more likely to have diabetes, and their median (IQR) cardiovascular SOFA score was higher: 2 (0–3) vs. 1 (0–3) in the total population, and 3 (0–3) vs. 1 (0–3) in the subset of patients randomized at sites offering hydrocortisone and control. These are notable differences when considering that the score varies between 0 and 4. As the proportions of patients dependent on vasopressors were very similar between the two groups (48% vs. 52%), this suggests that vasopressor doses were higher in the hydrocortisone group, an important prognostic factor which, unless we are mistaken, was not taken into account in the adjustment. Knowing the noradrenaline-equivalent doses administered could help clarify this point. Fifth, a recent meta-analysis of individual data suggests that a benefit of corticosteroids in CAP is only observed in the most inflammatory patients. If collected, it would be interesting to know the inflammatory parameters (at least CRP) of patients in both groups.

### Biological effects of corticosteroids on pneumococcal pneumonia in mice-translational significance [^1178zdR2]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial pneumonia is a frequent cause of severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common cause of bacterial community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which directly damages the lung epithelium and induces the release of a substantial number of cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells and macrophages, resulting in protein exudation and edema formation in the lung. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, the dysregulated pathogen-host interaction may still cause life-threatening acute respiratory failure.

Corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed as an adjunctive therapy for severe pulmonary infections and ARDS. The clinical benefit of adjunctive steroid therapy for pneumococcal infections has been previously demonstrated in meningitis. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated therapeutic benefits of dexamethasone, a long-acting glucocorticoid, on mortality in severe COVID-19 infection, non-COVID ARDS, and in severe CAP. However, the mechanisms by which steroids improve outcomes in patients with severe pneumonia or ARDS are not well established, and few studies have comprehensively characterized the effects of steroids in the respiratory tract of critically ill patients or clinically relevant animal models using bacterial pathogens treated with antibiotic therapy.

Corticosteroids are typically used to potently suppress systemic immune responses, but they have additional effects that may be relevant to lung injury, including effects on wound healing, modifying lung fluid balance and the extent of pulmonary edema, and metabolism. There is emerging evidence that corticosteroids have distinct effects on systemic vs. pulmonary inflammation. Given that corticosteroids have pleiotropic and lung-specific effects, elucidating the effects of corticosteroids on the injured lung in bacterial pneumonia is important for establishing a biologic rationale for further clinical application of steroids in severe lung infections. Understanding the specific mechanisms of corticosteroid benefit should help identify the patients with pneumonia or ARDS most likely to benefit from steroids.

To investigate the effects of corticosteroids in bacterial pneumonia, the primary objective was to carry out comprehensive biochemical, physiological, and histologic studies in mice to understand the effects of steroids in pneumococcal pneumonia. A secondary objective was to study lower respiratory tract gene expression in an observational cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with and without S. pneumoniae pneumonia to compare with transcriptional studies in the mice.

### The efficacy of corticosteroids therapy in patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial [^111oWQqg]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic. The disease is associated with a series of clinical settings from asymptomatic infections to mild and severe manifestations, contributing to a significant morbidity and mortality, as well as strain on intensive care unit (ICU) capacity.

As the pandemic progresses, overwhelming body of evidence regarding the pathological pattern of the disease and the potential impact of immunomodulatory strategies has suggested that cytokine storm may be the main cause of disease progression (the severity and clinical outcomes) leading to lung injury and organ failure.

Supportive and adjuvant therapy have been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 due to the absence of specific treatments such as antivirals. The histological pattern of pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) which characterize acute lung injury of the disease suggest that timely and appropriate use of corticosteroid may be beneficial in patients with severe disease.

The severity and pathophysiology of the disease have been linked to hyperinflammation, therefore, a combination therapy of off-label drugs such as immunosuppressor/immunomodulator, inflammatory cytokines antagonists, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be of utmost importance in mitigating the potential effects of cytokine storm in the inflammation-driven damaging phases of COVID-19.

Corticosteroids suppress inflammation-induced lung injury by inhibiting lung inflammation in critically ill patients. On February 6th, 2020, researchers from Edinburgh published a short review of clinical data regarding the outcomes of corticosteroid therapy in respiratory diseases. They concluded that there is no clinical data that supports the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. This was recapitulated by WHO who discouraged the use of steroids in Covid-19. Rapidly, the response from physicians from Wuhan and Beijing appeared. They opposed the liberal use of corticosteroids and recommend short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose, used prudently, for the most severely ill patients. The most robust evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids therapy came from the COVID-19 RECOVERY Trial. In this trial, the 28-day mortality rate for COVID-19 patients requiring either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy was decreased in patients treated with low dose dexamethasone (6 mg once daily). This finding led to the recommendation of corticosteroids therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients by the WHO (WHO, 2020).

### Effect of corticosteroids on the clinical course of community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^117SaqsZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advances in diagnostic methods and antibiotic treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of mortality. In the industrialized countries, CAP is the sixth highest cause of mortality and the first among infectious diseases. Although mortality in patients with CAP fell dramatically with the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s, since then it has remained relatively stable. Current series report an overall mortality rate of 8 to 15%.

A recent study of the factors associated with early death in patients with CAP reinforces the classical concept that some deaths were not due to failure to eradicate the microorganism causing CAP, but are closely related to inadequate host response. Excessive cytokine response in patients with severe CAP has been linked in many previous studies with deleterious effects and poor prognosis.

In this context, the use of immunomodulation appears to be an appealing option for improving prognosis in CAP. Theoretically, an anti-inflammatory treatment given prior to antibiotic therapy could prevent an excessive inflammatory response, improving the prognosis of more severe episodes of CAP. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy for pneumonia has been a matter of debate. Corticosteroids are known to reduce the production of the main inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6), and the subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells into the alveolar space leading to a more equilibrated response.

Here we conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to analyse whether a corticosteroid therapy, administered in the form of a methyl-prednisolone bolus given prior to antibiotic treatment followed by sustained infusion for nine days, was able to modulate the inflammatory response and clinical outcome of selected hospital-admitted CAP patients presenting respiratory failure and extensive radiological consolidations.

### The risk of corticosteroids in community-acquired… [^114jyeX6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A 71-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the knee presented with a five-day history of epigastric pain and melena. Two weeks before his presentation, he completed a seven-day course of levofloxacin and prednisone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. On presentation, he was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and breathing comfortably on ambient air. He had tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region and coarse rales on auscultation at the right lower base. Laboratory testing was notable only for a newly decreased hemoglobin level of 11 g per dL. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which demonstrated a bleeding peptic ulcer that was treated with thermal coagulation. The use of corticosteroids in clinical trials of CAP as adjunct to antibiotics dates back 60 years.

It was hypothesized that corticosteroids could dampen the bacterial endotoxin-mediated cytokine storm, prevent progression to septic shock, and treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. 1 Today, there is significant variability in the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of CAP in clinical practice. Our case illustrates an adverse patient event caused by inappropriate use. It is essential to distinguish the management of severe CAP from nonsevere CAP. The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2019 guidelines define severe CAP as requiring support in a critical care environment. 2 The previous IDSA/ATS 2007 guidelines did not comment on the routine use of corticosteroids for severe CAP, but the guidelines were updated in 2019 to advocate for use only in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
3.

Hyperglycemia, fluid retention, hypertension, delirium, psychosis, insomnia, osteonecrosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding may consequently be underestimated. The potential harmful adverse effects of corticosteroids for nonsevere CAP outweigh the potential benefits. Our case illustrates the importance of avoiding the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of CAP.

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^115htuN9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians generally agree that we should be more thoughtful and selective about the use of antibiotics in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and about the use of opioids for conditions such as back pain. However, prescriptions for antibiotics remain common in patients with acute respiratory infections. 1 Patients are increasingly seeking care for acute infections at urgent care centers, which prescribe antibiotics for respiratory infections more often than primary care practices. 1 Physicians also commonly prescribe short courses of oral corticosteroids, with one study finding the most common indication to be acute respiratory tract infection.
2. Meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroids may have a small benefit for acute cough and sore throat, but they included studies that were small or had a high risk of bias. 3, 4 The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials.

In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone.

The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. A short course of oral corticosteroids is appropriate for many patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and for selected patients with peritonsillar abscess, 8 severe pharyngitis, 9 and community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 10, 11 However, widespread use of corticosteroids in patients with non-pneumonia lower respiratory tract infection, nonsevere sore throat, or low back pain is inappropriate and not worth the risk of rare but potentially serious harms.

### Dexamethasone improves time to recovery for parapneumonic effusion… [^116P1wH7]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

Source: Researchers from multiple institutions in Spain conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if dexamethasone reduced recovery time in pediatric patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion. Children who were 1 month to 14 years of age and were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and pleural effusion at 1 of 9 study sites were eligible. CAP was defined as fever > 38°C, cough, and parenchymal infiltrate at chest radiography. Pleural effusions were diagnosed via thoracic ultrasonography and classified as either complicated or simple. Participants were randomized to receive either 8 intravenous doses of DXM or the corresponding volume of placebo over 48 hours.

All participants received cefotaxime at a dose of 50 mg/kg every 6 hours, which was continued until 48 hours after the patient was afebrile, and then switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate to complete a 15-day antimicrobial course. Participants also received ranitidine to prevent gastric bleeding. There were 60 patients randomized, 30 to each group. A total of 57 participants completed the trial. Overall, the median time to recovery was 68 hours shorter in the DXM group than in the placebo group on days 1–3 of hospitalization when compared to the placebo group.

The researchers conclude that DXM, in conjunction with antibiotics, appears to be a safe and effective therapy for CAP and parapneumonic pleural effusion.

### Corticosteroids for severe community-acquired pneumonia… [^111NNERc]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients were randomized to receive either an intravenous bolus of 0. 5 mg/kg per 12 hours of methylprednisolone or placebo for 5 days started within 36 hours of hospital admission. Main Outcomes and Measures. In-hospital mortality was a secondary outcome and adverse events were assessed. Results There was less treatment failure among patients from the methylprednisolone group compared with the placebo group, with a difference between groups of 18%. Corticosteroid treatment reduced the risk of treatment failure. Patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza A pneumonia were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either an intravenous bolus of 0. 5 mg/kg per 12 hours of methylprednisolone or placebo for 5 days started within 36 hours of hospital admission.

Randomization was based on 1-to-1 allocation of prenumbered boxes containing dosing units with identical appearance for methylprednisolone and placebo. Patients, investigators, and data assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. All patients were treated with antibiotics according to international guidelines. 19 Antibiotic treatments were not guided by levels of procalcitonin. One patient in the methylprednisolone group had a superinfection. Another patient in the methylprednisolone group had delirium. Another patient in the methylprednisolone group developed an acute hepatic failure. One patient in the placebo group had gastrointestinal bleeding. The results demonstrated that the acute administration of methylprednisolone was associated with less treatment failure and a lower inflammatory response in a prospectively identified population of patients with both severe community-acquired pneumonia and a high inflammatory response.

A systemic reduction in inflammatory biomarkers was observed during the study in both groups, with higher decreases in levels of CRP and IL-10 in patients receiving methylprednisolone. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have found those patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated with corticosteroids experienced a greater decline in levels of CRP8, 10, 11, 13 and IL-6. 10, 11.
