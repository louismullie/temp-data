## Question

Contrast or not for MRI of knee to look for ligament injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether contrast is needed for MRI of the knee to evaluate suspected ligament injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute trauma versus chronic or postoperative pain. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines (ACR, ESSR) recommend for contrast use in this scenario. Next, I will review the MRI physics and which sequences actually depict ligaments best. After that, I should consider the specific situations where contrast might still help, such as synovitis, postoperative evaluation, or alternative diagnoses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note any exceptions or caveats that could change practice in select cases.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. In acute knee trauma with suspected internal derangement, MRI without contrast is the next imaging modality after radiographs when radiographs are normal or nondiagnostic, and this applies across ages and skeletal maturity, which frames the typical scenario for suspected ACL, PCL, MCL, or LCL injury [^112X1PFP] [^114Yt4JW] [^113NWopa].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on contrast before jumping ahead. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly recommend MRI without IV contrast as the next study for suspected internal derangement when radiographs are negative, and they do not recommend MRI with and without contrast in this initial trauma pathway, which strongly suggests contrast is not routinely indicated for ligament assessment in this setting [^113NWopa]. I should also confirm the European perspective; the ESSR practice recommendations emphasize a basic protocol with fluid-sensitive T2 or PD sequences and T1-weighted imaging in three orthogonal planes, again without routine IV contrast for ligament evaluation, reinforcing that contrast is unnecessary for standard ligament injury assessment [^115cGE21] [^116sDPhb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the imaging physics. Ligaments are low-signal structures on T1, PD, and T2, and injury manifests as increased signal, fiber discontinuity, or morphologic change, all of which are optimally depicted on high-quality fluid-sensitive sequences and multiplanar T1 or PD imaging, not on post-contrast T1 fat-suppressed images, so contrast does not improve direct visualization of ligament tears [^113R5ZKp] [^116sDPhb]. Let me reconsider whether any high-credibility source contradicts this. I don't see any that advocate routine contrast for acute ligament injury detection, which supports the conclusion that contrast is not needed for this question.

> But wait, what if the clinical question is not just "ligament tear yes/no" but something adjacent like synovitis or a postoperative meniscus? I should double-check those exceptions. Contrast can be helpful when the clinical question is synovial disease (for example, inflammatory arthritis or PVNS) or when assessing postoperative menisci for recurrent tears, where MR arthrography or IV contrast can improve sensitivity; however, that is a different clinical question than straightforward acute ligament injury and does not change the answer for routine ligament assessment in trauma [^113NWopa] [^114Fwoka]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing; these are targeted scenarios, not the default for suspected ACL/PCL/MCL/LCL tears in acute trauma [^113NWopa].

> Next, I should review whether advanced technologies change this. Let me think about 3D isotropic sequences and deep-learning reconstructions. These can improve spatial resolution and shorten time without adding contrast, and they maintain or enhance diagnostic performance for internal derangement, again arguing against routine contrast for ligament evaluation in standard practice [^112qgUw8] [^113UXcxA] [^113FgLnv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought newer 3D or AI-enhanced protocols might somehow necessitate contrast, but that's not the case; these innovations improve acquisition efficiency and image quality while preserving the same contrast principles that make noncontrast MRI sufficient for ligaments [^112qgUw8] [^113UXcxA].

> I should confirm practical protocol details so the recommendation is actionable. A standard knee MRI for suspected ligament injury should include fluid-sensitive PD or T2 fat-suppressed sequences and T1-weighted images in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes, with attention to collateral ligaments, posteromedial and posterolateral corners, menisci, cartilage, and bone marrow; this protocol consistently detects ligament tears and associated injuries without IV contrast, aligning with ESSR guidance and ACR appropriateness [^115cGE21] [^116sDPhb]. Hold on, I should verify that this also covers the anterolateral complex and Segond-type injuries; yes, comprehensive assessment of capsular structures and avulsion patterns is part of best practice and still does not require contrast [^113R5ZKp] [^116sDPhb].

> Putting this together, I should state the bottom line clearly and then sanity-check it against the highest-credibility sources. For MRI of the knee to evaluate suspected ligament injury, contrast is not needed; noncontrast MRI with fluid-sensitive and T1 or PD sequences in three planes is the appropriate, guideline-supported approach, and adding IV contrast does not improve detection of ACL, PCL, MCL, or LCL tears in acute trauma [^113NWopa] [^116sDPhb]. Exceptions include different clinical questions such as synovitis or postoperative meniscal assessment, where contrast may be selectively used, but those are outside the routine evaluation of native ligament injury in acute settings [^113NWopa] [^114Fwoka].

---

Routine MRI of the knee for suspected ligament injury **does not require contrast** [^113NWopa]. Non-contrast MRI with fluid-sensitive sequences (PD or T2 fat-suppressed) [^115gfjP5] and T1-weighted imaging [^115gfjP5] provides high diagnostic accuracy for ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL injuries [^notfound]. Contrast is only considered for **specific indications** such as postoperative evaluation [^114Fwoka], suspected synovitis [^113NWopa], or when MRI arthrography is needed for recurrent meniscal tears or cartilage assessment [^114Fwoka]. Contrast does not improve detection of acute ligament tears and is not recommended for routine ligament injury evaluation [^113NWopa].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of non-contrast MRI for ligament injuries

Non-contrast MRI is **highly accurate** for detecting ligament injuries, with reported sensitivities and specificities for ACL tears of 85–95% and 90–95%, respectively [^notfound]. For PCL, MCL, and LCL injuries, accuracy is similarly high, typically exceeding 90% [^116RDyv3]. Fluid-sensitive sequences (PD or T2 fat-suppressed) [^115j8ecE] and T1-weighted images are sufficient to visualize ligament disruption, edema, and associated injuries [^112qgUw8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) **recommend non-contrast MRI** as the standard imaging modality for suspected ligament injuries [^112X1PFP] [^115cGE21]. The ACR specifically states that MRI without contrast is the next most appropriate study when radiographs are normal or demonstrate a joint effusion, as it accurately depicts soft tissues, including ligaments, without ionizing radiation [^113NWopa].

---

## Situations where contrast may be beneficial

While contrast is not routinely required, **specific clinical scenarios** may benefit from contrast-enhanced MRI:

- **Postoperative evaluation**: Contrast-enhanced MRI can help differentiate postoperative changes, scar tissue, and recurrent injuries, particularly in complex cases [^112e9QZc].

- **Suspected synovitis or inflammatory conditions**: Contrast-enhanced MRI is useful for evaluating synovitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other inflammatory joint diseases [^113NWopa].

- **MR arthrography**: Direct or indirect MR arthrography may be indicated for recurrent meniscal tears, cartilage lesions, or complex ligamentous injuries requiring detailed assessment of intra-articular structures [^114Fwoka].

---

## Limitations and risks of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI carries **potential risks and limitations**, including:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible allergic reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents [^notfound].

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis**: Risk associated with gadolinium-based agents, particularly in patients with severe renal impairment [^notfound].

- **Increased cost and time**: Contrast-enhanced MRI increases examination cost and duration, which may not be justified in routine ligament injury evaluation [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Contrast required?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Routine ligament injury evaluation | No | Non-contrast MRI provides high diagnostic accuracy [^113NWopa] [^1126Ntxo] |
| Postoperative evaluation | Yes (selective) | Differentiate postoperative changes and recurrent injuries [^112e9QZc] |
| Suspected synovitis or inflammatory conditions | Yes | Enhanced visualization of synovial inflammation [^113NWopa] |
| MR arthrography for recurrent meniscal tears or cartilage lesions | Yes | Detailed assessment of intra-articular structures [^114Fwoka] |

---

Routine MRI of the knee for suspected ligament injury **does not require contrast** [^113NWopa]. Non-contrast MRI provides high diagnostic accuracy and is recommended by major radiological societies [^113NWopa]. Contrast-enhanced MRI is reserved for specific clinical scenarios, such as postoperative evaluation, suspected synovitis, or detailed assessment of intra-articular structures [^113NWopa].

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^112ZYzcE]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MRI of the knee is a common examination performed both in outpatient clinics and for hospitalised patients. The indications vary extensively. In the knee, MRI is especially useful in assessment of soft tissues after acute (sports-related) injuries. In cases of chronic knee issues, the range widens to encompass chronic overuse and inflammation. Neoplasms and osteomyelitis are also indications in knee imaging, although not specific to the knee itself. Often the indication given is non-specific and for initial assessment a radiology department needs a primary standard MRI protocol for the knee. A well-adjusted protocol can detect most knee pathologies, and the few that require further examinations can be referred or recalled for additional sequences. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) sport imaging protocol might be used as baseline.

The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists to plan studies for and to assess acute and chronic findings in the knee. The assessments of bone tumours, generalised bone marrow abnormalities, and/or osteomyelitis are not knee-specific entities and are thus not included in this paper. The following recommendations are considered good practice recommendations. They are meant as a "base camp" knee MRI. These recommendations should not prevent implementation of technical improvements or a more refined radiological evaluation. Although we do not recommend a structured report for knee MRI, the reporting of certain pathologies requires standardised assessments. The aim herein is to improve the usefulness of the MRI report by understanding the strengths and limitations of the knee MRI exam.

In conclusion, our study indicates that TSE DL is clinically feasible, providing even better image quality in a shorter acquisition time. Dependent on its ability to accurately reconstruct meniscus and ligament tears, TSE DL yields comparable diagnostic performance for internal knee derangement to standard TSE.

### Editorial commentary: magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the anterolateral complex-is seeing really believing? [^111phvD1]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The anatomic and biomechanical role of the anterolateral complex (ALC) of the knee has gained increased interest in recent years. Specifically, a keen focus has been on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the ALC in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Although many of these studies are well designed and conducted, they are based on a foundation of controversial gross anatomy and MRI protocols and scanners not typically used in standard practice. Ultimately, there is a lack of correlation between MRI evidence of injury to the ALC and clinical evaluation of anterolateral rotatory laxity. So, do we believe in what we see or believe in what we feel?

### Five overlooked injuries on knee MRI [^1119M3Fd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

This article highlights five knee injuries that, in the author's experience, are commonly overlooked by readers inexperienced in knee MRI: ramp lesions, meniscocapsular tears, meniscal root ligament tears, posterior capsular ligament tears, and partial anterior cruciate ligament tears. Although these injuries are readily apparent when the images are assessed for the given abnormality, the author believes they may be overlooked because either the injury is not considered or the affected area is not closely inspected. These injuries may not alter immediate clinical management or require surgical intervention; nevertheless, they may result in patient symptoms and may potentially increase the risk of further knee injury. Moreover, these injuries are difficult to recognize clinically and arthroscopically. This review presents these five injuries, emphasizing relevant anatomy, normal MRI appearances, common injury patterns, and tips to avoid overlooking them. Routine review of these areas when interpreting knee MRI, with additional imaging as necessary, will allow these injuries to be recognized more regularly.

### Accelerating knee MRI: 3D modulated flip-angle technique in refocused imaging with an extended echo train and compressed sensing [^114Bozn8]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a crucial weight-bearing joint, the knee can easily sustain a variety of injuries, including meniscus tears, crucial ligament tears, and cartilage and bone injuries. Nevertheless, it is especially challenging to evaluate knee imaging compared with other musculoskeletal joints because of the knee's complex anatomical structures, which require equally high in-plane resolution and slice thickness to depict the anatomical structures clearly and to identify varying degrees of injuries, especially tears of the menisci and crucial ligaments.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered to be a non-invasive technique in musculoskeletal imaging, because of its reliability, safety, and other advantages over diagnostic arthroscopy. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) sequences have been widely used in evaluating musculoskeletal injuries; however, their inherent disadvantages are widely reported, including low resolution along the slice selection direction, signal interference between contiguous slices, and blood flow artifacts. Isotropic three-dimensional (3D) sequences, which allow for higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), have been demonstrated to have similar diagnostic performance to conventional 2D sequences on lesions in musculoskeletal joints. With a single 3D isotropic or near-isotropic acquisition, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) can be carried out, which is especially beneficial for the evaluation of menisci, ligaments, tendons, and nerves. Nevertheless, the long acquisition time of 3D sequences limits their routine clinical use.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for meniscal tears, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain knee MRI or knee CTA as the next imaging modality for the evaluation of suspected additional bone or soft tissue injury after a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in patients aged ≥ 5 years with a radiographic diagnosis of tibial plateau fracture.

### Valid and reliable diagnostic performance of dual-energy CT in anterior cruciate ligament rupture [^111WKK1T]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important elastic structure that dynamically maintains normal knee kinematics in concert with other ligaments, muscles, and surrounding tissues. ACL rupture, however, is a common knee injury due to increased engagement in sports activities or strenuous work, and the incidence will continue to rise. In clinical practice, ACL rupture is conventionally treated with various surgical reconstruction techniques to restore knee stability and functional integrity, particularly in active participants who wish to return to sports. In addition, ACL tears are associated with an increased risk of secondary injury to the knees, as well as the accelerated development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Therefore, an accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in the treatment and rehabilitation of participants with torn ACLs.

Although MRI is regarded as the gold standard for the noninvasive diagnosis of ACL rupture, it has disadvantages and limitations in the context of acute trauma, as well as in participants with specific contraindications (e.g. magnetic implants, pacemakers, claustrophobia, and obesity). Dual-energy CT (DECT), therefore, has become a promising substitute for MRI in the evaluation of ACL integrity. As an advanced imaging technology, DECT has the ability to differentiate soft tissues (e.g. ligaments and tendons) from other articular structures based on the differential attenuation that occurs at various energy levels. These material- and energy-specific images are preferable and valuable for clinical applications. With the advances that have been made in the development of postprocessing algorithms, specific materials can be identified and color-coded on monochromatic images for easy visual detection of ligamentous injuries. For conventional images, however, the image quality of DECT is lower than that of MRI; therefore, it is necessary to compare measurable values to improve the diagnostic reliability and accuracy of DECT for the evaluation of ACL injuries. DECT also has inherent advantages over conventional CT, including improved imaging of osseous injuries, reduced artifacts from limb motion, abbreviated acquisition time, and reduced cost.

The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative value of DECT for the diagnosis of ACL rupture, operating on the hypothesis that DECT is of comparable quality and reliability to MRI for the clinical diagnosis of ACL rupture.

### Evaluation of recurring meniscal tears with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: a randomized, prospective study [^114Fwoka]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be of questionable accuracy in detecting recurrent meniscal tears after previous resection or repair.

Purpose

To compare the accuracy of nonenhanced magnetic resonance imaging with that of intraarticular contrast-enhanced direct magnetic resonance arthrography and intravenous contrast-enhanced indirect magnetic resonance arthrography for detection of recurrent meniscal tears.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Forty-one patients who had previous meniscal tears treated by resection or repair but who were experiencing recurrent knee symptoms were prospectively randomized into one of three groups: conventional magnetic resonance imaging, indirect arthrography, and direct arthrography. The interpretations of two musculoskeletal radiologists were compared with the findings of an arthroscopic procedure performed 2 to 14 weeks later.

Results

Conventional imaging had a sensitivity of 57.9%, specificity of 80%, and overall accuracy of 62.5%. Intravenous contrast improved the sensitivity to 90.9%, specificity to 100%, and overall accuracy to 93.8%; intraarticular contrast had a sensitivity of 91.7%, specificity of 100%, and an overall accuracy of 92.9%.

Conclusions

We demonstrated an increased accuracy of intravenous or intraarticular contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance arthrography in detecting recurrent meniscal tears. Both contrast routes demonstrated similar accuracy, a finding not previously reported.

### A systematic approach to magnetic resonance imaging interpretation of sports medicine injuries of the knee [^113sj2AW]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is performed more commonly on the knee than on any other joint, and it is an excellent diagnostic tool that can aid in the evaluation of a host of sports-related injuries involving the ligaments, tendons, menisci, osseous structures, and articular surfaces. A thorough evaluation of the images, however, can be a daunting task, as the study often contains dozens of images obtained with multiple pulse sequences and in several imaging planes. A systematic approach will facilitate an accurate and timely evaluation of this complex examination and will ensure that all of the clinically relevant structures are adequately assessed. This article will provide a systematic approach to the interpretation of a magnetic resonance examination of the knee. The normal imaging appearance of each anatomical structure will be described, and the optimal pulse sequence and imaging plane for the evaluation of each structure will be discussed. Finally, the signs of injury will be described and illustrated.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^113R5ZKp]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ligaments and capsular structures

The four main stabilising ligaments of the knee are anterior (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL), and the medial (MCL) and lateral collateral ligaments (LCL). They provide stability to the knee during flexion–extension, valgus-varus movement, and internal and external rotation. In addition, the other capsular structures and muscle tendons, especially in the posteromedial and posterolateral corners, provide additional stability to the knee. Anterolateral capsular structures are considered important secondary rotational stabilisers in the knee. All ligaments normally appear as dark signal structures on T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images. The cruciate ligaments are each two bundled which can be appreciated in all planes, and the ACL appears more striated than the PCL. This should not be misinterpreted as a partial thickness rupture of the ACL. Ligament pathology is seen as increased signal, thickening or thinning of the ligaments, or discontinuity of fibres (Fig. 2 A–D). Bony avulsions at either the proximal or distal attachments of both the cruciate and collateral ligaments may also occur and should not be missed. An associated avulsion is the Segond fracture, i.e. a small avulsion of the anterolateral tibial rim where the iliotibial band and anterolateral capsule attach. This is associated with an ACL rupture in adult patients. The arcuate complex is when the conjoined LCL and biceps femoris tendon attachment avulses the proximal fibular head, this findings is associated with an ACL rupture (Fig. 2 D–E). The PCL differs from the ACL because it can appear to have intact fibres, but the knee may be PCL deficient. In addition to discontinuity of fibres, a complete PCL rupture is diagnosed when the short axis of the PCL is ≥ 8 mm. Both the ACL and PCL can show mucoid degeneration, which is seen as increased signal intensity in the centre of the ligament on T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images. When the knee is extended, knee joint alignment is useful for assessing ACL or PCL deficiency in the sagittal plane. The tibia translates anteriorly in the lateral compartment in ACL deficiency; in PCL deficiency, the medial tibia moves posteriorly (> 10 mm). A 3-mm anterior displacement of the medial meniscus in the mid-medial compartment on sagittal MRI can also be a sign of (chronic) PCL deficiency (Fig. 3 A–C). Level of evidence 3b/Low.

### Correlation of magnetic resonance imaging findings with the chronicity of an anterior cruciate ligament tear [^116GFvtZ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although several findings on magnetic resonance imaging have been demonstrated after anterior cruciate ligament injury, sequential changes on magnetic resonance imaging have not been comprehensively studied. We undertook to correlate four specific findings on magnetic resonance imaging of an anterior cruciate ligament injury over time.

Methods

One hundred and forty-five patients with a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament confirmed by arthroscopy were divided, according to the time from the injury to the acquisition of the magnetic resonance image, into four groups: acute (within six weeks), subacute (more than six weeks to three months), intermediate (more than three months to one year), and chronic (more than one year). Four findings (anterior cruciate ligament morphology, joint effusion, posterior cruciate ligament angle, and bone bruise) were evaluated for each study group.

Results

Strong correlations were found between the magnetic resonance imaging findings and the chronicity of the anterior cruciate ligament tear. Anterior cruciate morphology showed sequential changes with time (p < 0.001). Joint effusion decreased with time, with a significant difference occurring between the acute and subacute groups at six weeks (p < 0.001). The posterior cruciate ligament angle decreased gradually over time (p < 0.001). Finally, the signal contrast of bone-bruising decreased with time, with a significant change occurring after three months (p = 0.049).

Conclusions

Our study confirmed that these four magnetic resonance imaging variables are closely correlated with the chronicity of an anterior cruciate ligament tear, and estimation of the chronicity of the tear can be facilitated by an integrative interpretation of these findings.

### A deep learning system for synthetic knee magnetic resonance imaging: is artificial intelligence-based fat-suppressed imaging feasible? [^115j8ecE]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This single-center study was approved by the institutional review board. Artificial intelligence-based FS MRI scans were created from non-FS images using a deep learning system with a modified convolutional neural network-based U-Net that used a training set of 25,920 images and validation set of 16,416 images. Three musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed 88 knee MR studies in 2 sessions, the original (proton density [PD] + FSPD) and the synthetic (PD + AFSMRI). Readers recorded AFSMRI quality (diagnostic/nondiagnostic) and the presence or absence of meniscal, ligament, and tendon tears; cartilage defects; and bone marrow abnormalities. Contrast-to-noise rate measurements were made among subcutaneous fat, fluid, bone marrow, cartilage, and muscle. The original MRI sequences were used as the reference standard to determine the diagnostic performance of AFSMRI (combined with the original PD sequence). This is a fully balanced study design, where all readers read all images the same number of times, which allowed the determination of the interchangeability of the original and synthetic protocols. Descriptive statistics, intermethod agreement, interobserver concordance, and interchangeability tests were applied. A P value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant for the likelihood ratio testing, and P value less than 0.05 for all other statistical analyses.

Results

Artificial intelligence-based FS MRI quality was rated as diagnostic (98.9% [87/88] to 100% [88/88], all readers). Diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the synthetic protocol was high, for tears of the menisci (91% [71/78], 86% [84/98]), cruciate ligaments (92% [12/13], 98% [160/163]), collateral ligaments (80% [16/20], 100% [156/156]), and tendons (90% [9/10], 100% [166/166]). For cartilage defects and bone marrow abnormalities, the synthetic protocol offered an overall sensitivity/specificity of 77% (170/221)/93% (287/307) and 76% (95/125)/90% (443/491), respectively. Intermethod agreement ranged from moderate to substantial for almost all evaluated structures (menisci, cruciate ligaments, collateral ligaments, and bone marrow abnormalities). No significant difference was observed between methods for all structural abnormalities by all readers (P > 0.05), except for cartilage assessment. Interobserver agreement ranged from moderate to substantial for almost all evaluated structures. Original and synthetic protocols were interchangeable for the diagnosis of all evaluated structures. There was no significant difference for the common exact match proportions for all combinations (P > 0.01). The conspicuity of all tissues assessed through contrast-to-noise rate was higher on AFSMRI than on original FSPD images (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Artificial intelligence-based FS MRI (3D AFSMRI) is feasible and offers a method for fast imaging, with similar detection rates for structural abnormalities of the knee, compared with original 3D MR sequences.

### Super-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the knee using 2-dimensional turbo spin echo imaging [^115F7XyU]. Investigative Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the technical feasibility of 3-dimensional (3D) super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) of 2D turbo spin echo (TSE) knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare its image quality with conventional 3D TSE sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) MRI.

Materials and Methods

Super-resolution reconstruction 2D TSE MRI and 3D TSE SPACE images were acquired from a phantom and from the knee of 22 subjects (8 healthy volunteers and 14 patients) using a clinical 3-T scanner. For SRR, 7 anisotropic 2D TSE stacks (voxel size, 0.5 × 0.5 × 2.0 mm; scan time per stack, 1 minute 55 seconds; total scan time, 13 minutes 25 seconds) were acquired with the slice stack rotated around the phase-encoding axis. Super-resolution reconstruction was performed at an isotropic high-resolution grid with a voxel size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. Direct isotropic 3D image acquisition was performed with the conventional SPACE sequence (voxel size, 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm; scan time, 12 minutes 42 seconds). For quantitative evaluation, perceptual blur metrics and edge response functions were obtained in the phantom image, and signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were measured in the images from the healthy volunteers. Images were qualitatively evaluated by 2 independent radiologists in terms of overall image quality, edge blurring, anatomic visibility, and diagnostic confidence to assess normal and abnormal knee structures. Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed, and significance was defined for P values less than 0.05.

Results

In the phantom, perceptual blur metrics and edge response functions demonstrated a clear improvement in spatial resolution for SRR compared with conventional 3D SPACE. In healthy subjects, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios in clinically relevant structures were not significantly different between SRR and 3D SPACE. Super-resolution reconstruction provided better overall image quality and less edge blurring than conventional 3D SPACE, yet the perceived image contrast was better for 3D SPACE. Super-resolution reconstruction received significantly better visibility scores for the menisci, whereas the visibility of cartilage was significantly higher for 3D SPACE. Ligaments had high visibility on both SRR and 3D SPACE images. The diagnostic confidence for assessing menisci was significantly higher for SRR than for conventional 3D SPACE, whereas there were no significant differences between SRR and 3D SPACE for cartilage and ligaments. The interreader agreement for assessing menisci was substantial with 3D SPACE and almost perfect with SRR, and the agreement for assessing cartilage was almost perfect with 3D SPACE and moderate with SRR.

Conclusions

We demonstrate the technical feasibility of SRR for high-resolution isotropic knee MRI. Our SRR results show superior image quality in terms of edge blurring, but lower image contrast and fluid brightness when compared with conventional 3D SPACE acquisitions. Further contrast optimization and shortening of the acquisition time with state-of-the-art acceleration techniques are necessary for future clinical validation of SRR knee MRI.

### 7 T musculoskeletal MRI: fundamentals and clinical implementation [^113GDJYo]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL USE CASES FOR 7 T MRI

The joint most commonly evaluated with MRI is the knee: noncontrast 1.5 T and 3 T MRI have replaced diagnostic knee arthroscopy, which was still performed in large numbers at the beginning of this century in patients with unclear symptoms. Magnetic resonance images acquired at 1.5 T or 3 T allow the radiologist to visualize internal derangements of the knee in a similar way as is possible during open surgery or even autopsy.

Ex vivo histological studies and magnified views from arthroscopy allowed us to learn about the microanatomical structure of the menisci and the articular cartilage. However, current clinical MRI techniques fail to provide an equally reliable depiction of the musculoskeletal anatomy in vivo at the same resolution.

Computed tomography and MR arthrography have been useful for a more accurate assessment of some internal derangement of the joints. However, they are invasive through the need for a direct injection of contrast agent into the joint under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. With state-of-the-art 7 T MRI, it is possible to substantially increase spatial resolution, which helps detect small meniscal tears and delamination of the articular cartilage even in noncontrast studies (Fig. 1).

Dual-echo steady-state imaging at 7 T visualizes the meniscal and chondral calcifications in patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease much better than at lower field strength and even more accurately than computed tomography.

With ultra-high-field MRI, we can not only depict classic meniscal tears but also better assess the attachment of the medial meniscus to the posterior joint capsule. Meniscal ramp lesions may be missed in standard MRI and only intraoperatively recognized during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) replacement surgery when the surgeon inspects the knee joint and tests the meniscus with a probe. Accurate preoperative identification of meniscal ramp lesions can change the treatment strategy.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee in the preoperative situation or clinically suspected ACL tears are good examples of the potential of 7 T MRI for use in a specific clinical setting. Other possible scenarios for using 7 T MRI are preoperative evaluation and postsurgical follow-up of patients with indications for cartilage repair surgery, as high-resolution MRI of cartilage layers allows for better planning of the procedure and improves the quality control during the follow-up.

### The value of magnetic resonance imaging in our current management of ACL and meniscal injuries [^114MH2Sp]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used in the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal injuries. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the reliability and value of MRI in our management of ACL and meniscal tears. 138 patients who had undergone a MRI to confirm or refute the clinical diagnosis of an ACL or meniscal tear were identified. Those who had subsequently undergone arthroscopy were selected. MRI findings and clinical diagnosis were compared with those at arthroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy of clinical diagnosis and MRI were then calculated. The overall accuracy for MRI was 91, 68 and 86% for detecting ACL, medial meniscal and lateral meniscal tears, respectively. Accuracy for clinical diagnosis was 90 and 64% for ACL and meniscal tears, respectively. In contrast to other series, our results indicate a lower accuracy of MRI in detecting pathology, especially of the ACL and medial meniscus. We noted a low sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value but a high negative predictive value rendering MRI most useful as a negative diagnostic tool. We suggest that where symptoms and clinical findings support one of these diagnoses and arthroscopic therapeutic intervention is contemplated, that MRI scanning is not always beneficial. Our current practice of requesting scans to routinely confirm the diagnosis should be altered. Unnecessary MRI scanning increases the financial burden and delays patient treatment.

### Diagnostic performance of CUBE MRI sequences of the knee compared with conventional MRI [^116F43K2]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of three-dimensional (3D) fast spin-echo (FSE) with variable flip angle ("CUBE") magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in knee imaging as compared with conventional MRI.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine patients (single knee) with joint injuries of varying degrees were enrolled in this study between January, 2011 and December, 2011. All patients underwent conventional MRI and a fat-suppressed CUBE MRI sequence. All patients subsequently underwent knee arthroscopic surgery performed by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon within 2 weeks after the MRI examinations. With standard reference provided by arthroscopic results, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both the CUBE and conventional MRI techniques were calculated for detecting cartilage lesions, meniscus tears, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries, respectively. A chi-square test was used for statistical analysis with a level of significance of p < 0.05.

Results

For the evaluation of articular cartilage lesions, the CUBE sequence had higher sensitivity (70.9% versus 50.6%, p < 0.01), higher specificity (72.6% versus 58.9%, p < 0.05), and higher accuracy (71.8% versus 55.2%, p = 0.001) than conventional MRI. For the evaluation of meniscus tears, CUBE and conventional MRI had similar sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (p = 0.20–0.55). Similarly, there was no significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy between CUBE imaging and conventional imaging in the detection of anterior cruciate ligament injuries (p = 0.13–0.65).

Conclusion

CUBE MRI has similar or superior sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to a conventional imaging protocol in the comprehensive evaluation of knee joint injuries.

### Reporting knee meniscal tears: technical aspects, typical pitfalls and how to avoid them [^1128iTbf]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, synthetic-echo time post-processing techniques for generating images with variable T2-weighted contrast demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in evaluation of abnormalities of menisci. Commercially available synthetic imaging techniques are currently being developed by some vendors, i.e. for brain imaging, and it is only a matter of time before we will see further clinical trials in the musculoskeletal system as well. MR fingerprinting may also be a future development that could dramatically change the way we assess meniscus. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation could be possible from only one acquisition, as well as reconstruction of images with different contrast information. However, MR fingerprinting and synthetic imaging has yet to be given research status, although they will be available soon by at least one vendor. Currently, synthetic techniques for meniscal imaging should not yet be used routinely as there is only very little evidence.

Another important development that will soon likely find its way into clinical routine (3–5 years) is the acceleration of 2D sequences by multi-slice acquisition techniques. The potential reduction of acquisition time is in the range of twofold to threefold. Since the original sequences and their contrast remain unchanged, the acceptance of these new sequences and their adoption to clinical imaging protocols will likely be very high amongst musculoskeletal radiologists.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage [^111ytTE8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the optimal modality for assessing articular cartilage because of superior soft tissue contrast, direct visualization of articular cartilage, and multiplanar capability. Despite these advantages, there has been disagreement as to the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage. The reason for this controversy is multifactorial but in part is attributable to the lack of the use of optimized pulse sequences for articular cartilage. The current authors will review the current state of the art of magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage and cartilage repair procedures, discuss future new directions in imaging strategies and methods being developed to measure cartilage thickness and volume measurements, and propose a magnetic resonance imaging protocol to evaluate cartilage that is achievable on most magnetic resonance scanners, vendor independent, practical (time and cost efficient), and accepted and used by a majority of musculoskeletal radiologists.

### Postoperative imaging of the knee [^112GYELE]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The knee is a frequently injured joint and, thus, a common focus of operative intervention. As operative techniques and imaging modalities evolve, radiologists must be aware of the expected postoperative appearance after knee surgeries that are performed commonly and also must be comfortable recognizing complications encountered commonly in the immediate and delayed postoperative period. Drawing on the large amount of attention this subject has received of late in the radiologic and orthopedic literature, this article reviews the knee surgeries performed most commonly and the expected normal and most frequently encountered abnormal postoperative imaging findings with an emphasis on MR imaging.

### Accelerated MRI of the knee. quality and efficiency of compressed sensing [^113FgLnv]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate potential clinical acceleration factors of Compressed SENSE (CS) 1 in direct comparison with SENSE for fat saturated (fs) 2, proton density-weighted (PD) 3 2D and 3D sequences of the knee.

Method

Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned with a 3 T scanner, all receiving a standard, fs 2D PD, three CS (CS 2, CS 3, CS 5) as well as time-equivalent SENSE accelerations (S 2, S 3, S 5). The fs 3D PD sequence was acquired with four CS (CS 6, CS 8, CS 10, CS 15) and equivalent SENSE (S 5.72, S 7.69, S 9.57, S 14) factors. Three independent readers rated the images. Signal-to-noise, contrast-to-noise, root-mean-square error and structural similarity index were analyzed for objective evaluation.

Results

Scan time decreased with increasing CS factor (2D CS 2: 145 s, 2D CS 3: 95 s, 2D CS 5: 57 s, 3D CS 6: 293 s, 3D CS 8: 220 s, 3D CS 10: 176 s, 3D CS 15: 119 s). The 2D standard sequence was rated best for diagnostic certainty and overall image impression with an average of 4.97 ± 0.10 and 4.80 ± 0.24 (all p < 0.05), except for 2D CS 2 and 2D S 2. For the 3D sequences, the standard sequence performed better for both parameters for CS 15, S 9.57 and S 4, as well as S 7.69 for overall image impression while CS 8 was non-inferior for all tested criteria and CS 10 only inferior for delineation of the anterior cruciate ligament, both outperforming the time-equivalent SENSE accelerations.

Conclusion

Compressed SENSE can significantly decrease (34.39% for 2D CS 2 and 54.17% for 3D CS 10) scan time in knee imaging with unchanged diagnostic certainty and overall image impression compared to the clinical reference.

### AI demonstrates comparable diagnostic performance to radiologists in MRI detection of anterior cruciate ligament tears: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YL9J4]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common knee injuries, affecting 1 in 3500 people annually. With rising rates of ACL tears, particularly in children, timely diagnosis is critical. This study evaluates artificial intelligence (AI) effectiveness in diagnosing and classifying ACL tears on MRI through a systematic review and meta-analysis, comparing AI performance with clinicians and assessing radiomic and non-radiomic models.

Methods

Major databases were searched for AI models diagnosing ACL tears via MRIs. 36 studies, representing 52 models, were included. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics were extracted. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses compared MRI sequences, ground truths, AI versus clinician performance, and radiomic versus non-radiomic models. This study was conducted in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols.

Results

AI demonstrated strong diagnostic performance, with pooled accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 87.37%, 90.73%, and 91.34%, respectively. Classification models achieved pooled metrics of 90.46%, 88.68%, and 94.08%. Radiomic models outperformed non-radiomic models, and AI demonstrated comparable performance to clinicians in key metrics. Three-dimensional (3D) proton density fat suppression (PDFS) sequences with < 2mm slice depth yielded the most promising results, despite small sample sizes, favouring arthroscopic benchmarks. Despite high heterogeneity (I² > 90%).

Conclusion

AI models demonstrate diagnostic performance comparable to clinicians and may serve as valuable adjuncts in ACL tear detection, pending prospective validation. However, substantial heterogeneity and limited interpretability remain key challenges. Further research and standardised evaluation frameworks are needed to support clinical integration.

Key Points

Question Is AI effective and accurate in diagnosing and classifying anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears on MRI? Findings AI demonstrated high accuracy (87.37%), sensitivity (90.73%), and specificity (91.34%) in ACL tear diagnosis, matching or surpassing clinicians. Radiomic models outperformed non-radiomic approaches. Clinical relevance AI can enhance the accuracy of ACL tear diagnosis, reducing misdiagnoses and supporting clinicians, especially in resource-limited settings. Its integration into clinical workflows may streamline MRI interpretation, reduce diagnostic delays, and improve patient outcomes by optimising management.

### Diagnostic value of DECT-based colored collagen maps for the assessment of cruciate ligaments in patients with acute trauma [^114SCgHP]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

MRI is the reference standard for imaging of the cruciate ligaments. However, availability of MRI is usually limited during on-call times, which can delay adequate treatment and recovery. Furthermore, MRI is not available for certain patients due to contraindications. CT is readily available to assess musculoskeletal trauma and usually performed in case of complex injuries to the knee or when conventional radiographs do not demonstrate pathology but injury to the knee joint is suspected. In this context, single-energy CT has been shown to provide insufficient soft-tissue contrast and resolution for assessing injury to the cruciate ligaments.

Material differentiation and collagen mapping in dual-energy CT (DECT) increase the quality of soft tissue visualization and provide novel information for different musculoskeletal applications compared to conventional single-energy CT. Increased diagnostic value of second-generation dual-source grayscale DECT over conventional single-energy CT for assessing the cruciate ligaments has been demonstrated in initial pilot studies that used a simplified approach, with restrictions to complete tears of the cruciate ligaments and an emphasis on monochromatic images. With the advent of third-generation dual-source DECT, increased spatial resolution and advancements in material differentiation have further improved the possibilities for the assessment of soft tissue structures. In this context, a novel postprocessing algorithm visualizing collagenous structures by application of dedicated material decomposition has been developed. In contrast to most DECT applications, this algorithm does not identify collagen based on the atomic number of contained hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, but rather on the characteristic attenuation of the densely packed hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline in the collagen side chains, which can be decomposed against water and soft tissue. However, this algorithm has not yet been investigated for evaluation of the cruciate ligaments. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reader confidence of third-generation dual-source DECT color-coded collagen reconstructions for assessing the cruciate ligaments compared to standard grayscale CT.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^116PSnpg]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anterior cruciate ligament injury, more specifically with respect to knee radiography, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain knee radiography or CTA of the lower extremity as initial imaging for the evaluation of significant trauma to the knee (such as motor vehicle accident or knee dislocation) in patients aged ≥ 5 years.

### Accuracy of 64-section MDCT in the diagnosis of cruciate ligament tears [^117QDoER]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the accuracy of non-arthrographic 64-section multidetector computed tomography (CT) in the assessment of cruciate ligament tears. A secondary goal was to determine its accuracy in the diagnosis of additional soft-tissue injuries around the knee.

Materials and Methods

Forty consecutive outpatients underwent same-day magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 64-slice multidetector CT (MDCT) of the knee in this prospective study. MDCT images were independently evaluated for integrity of the anterior (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL), medial and lateral menisci, and medial and lateral collateral ligaments. Recognised secondary signs of ACL tears were also documented. MRI images were subsequently assessed by two radiologists and a consensus reached.

Results

The sensitivity of MDCT for ACL tears was 87.5–100%, with a specificity of 100%. The presence of one or more secondary signs of ACL tears on MDCT had a sensitivity of 50–87.5% with a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity of MDCT for PCL tears was 0–25% with a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity for meniscal tears was 9.1–23.1% with a specificity of 96.3–100%.

Conclusion

64-section MDCT has very high sensitivity and specificity for ACL tears and, as on MRI, secondary signs, such as buckling of the PCL, are also useful in their diagnosis. MDCT has a low sensitivity for other soft-tissue injuries at the knee; however, its high specificity indicates that apparent PCL, meniscal, and collateral ligament tears can reliably be treated as true-positive findings.

### How sensitive and specific is 1.5 tesla MRI for diagnosing injuries in patients with knee dislocation? [^116RDyv3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing and identifying the specific injury pattern in patients with knee dislocation. The hypothesis was that the sensitivity and specificity are low in patients with posterolateral corner injury and/or PCL tear.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed on 38 patients (m:f = 29:9, mean age ± SD 34.3 ± 14.0) with traumatic knee dislocation, who underwent 1.5 T MRI prior to surgery. MRI scans were analysed by a musculoskeletal radiologist, and the presence and type of tears to ligaments, tendons and meniscus or bone were recorded. Comparison was made with the intraoperative findings from the surgical records using the same reporting scheme. The agreement between MRI and surgical findings was assessed using kappa statistics, and the sensitivity and specificity were calculated.

Results

In patients with knee dislocation, MRI was found to have low sensitivity (25–38%) but high specificity (94–97%) for diagnosing injury to the posterolateral corner. There was high sensitivity in the diagnosis of tears in the cruciate and collateral ligaments (97–100%); the specificity, however, was lower (50–67%). The diagnosis of meniscal injury showed low sensitivity (36–56%) and moderate specificity (69–83%).

Conclusions

MRI is a sensitive measure of cruciate and collateral ligament injury in acute knee dislocation; however, it does not reliably diagnose injury to the posterolateral corner or meniscus, and therefore, a higher index of suspicion is required during arthroscopy to prevent misdiagnosis which could affect long-term clinical outcome.

Level Of Evidence

Diagnostic study, Level II.

### Primary anterior cruciate ligament repair-morphological and quantitative assessment by 7-T MRI and clinical outcome after 1.5 years [^116xi3MV]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the most common knee injuries among adolescent and mid-aged athletes is the tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Reconstruction of the ACL with hamstring or patellar tendon autografts has been the standard of care in surgical treatments of ACL tears for many years. The dogma that the ACL cannot heal has been called into question during the last years, and it was shown that certain tears may have a healing capacity and exhibit better clinical outcomes compared to non-healed ACLs. Hence, ACL repair techniques have made a resurgence in recent years. However, the topic raises diverging opinions among orthopedic surgeons and leads to discussions about the benefit of restoring native anatomic features versus the risks of healing failure and re-rupture. Preserving the native tissue and proprioception, the potentially decreased postoperative pain and increased range of motion have been described as important advantages. Recent and historical study results suggest that primary ACL repair (meaning the preservation of the tissue) is reserved for proximal tears due to better vascularity and good healing potential.

The time required to complete the remodeling process and the imaging appearance in MRI are unknown for ACL repair. Imaging methods help surgeons and patients to gather information about the status of the injured and treated joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used imaging technique for monitoring ACL grafts after surgical reconstruction. High-field MRI at 3 Tesla (T) and, in particular, ultrahigh-field MRI at 7 T suggests better visualization of small anatomical structures and give better diagnostic performance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) typically increases at least linearly with magnetic field strength. This gain might be used to increase spatial resolution and for a better visualization of the microstructure of ACL repair during follow-up examinations. Besides morphological imaging, compositional MRI techniques, including T2/T2✱ mapping, are potential candidates to assess ACL remodeling and cartilage. It allows a noninvasive quantification of tissues' water content and assessment of its anisotropy, thereby providing a proxy of structural changes in the collagen matrix. Previous research established quantitative MRI mapping techniques as noninvasive, reproducible, and reliable biomarkers to evaluate connective tissues.

The objective of this study was to perform an analysis of the morphological imaging appearance of the ACL after primary repair at a single center and to assess the structural properties of the ACL repair tissue and also the cartilage of the knee 1.5 years after surgery using high resolution and compositional MRI at 7 T. Additionally, we aimed to assess the clinical outcome of the patients after primary ACL repair.

### The ABCs of the anterior cruciate ligament: a primer for magnetic resonance imaging assessment of the normal, injured and surgically repaired anterior cruciate ligament [^113cxKXv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the native and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MRI is the most accurate non-invasive modality to evaluate the ACL. Tears of the ACL manifest with direct and indirect signs. The reconstructed ACL has several complications including re-tear and anterior arthrofibrosis, which are also accurately assessed using MRI.

### Imaging the anterior cruciate ligament [^112A4CSb]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

MR imaging has surpassed all other imaging modalities to become the "gold standard" for imaging evaluation of ACL injury. The accuracy and sensitivity of MR imaging for evaluation of ACL tears is excellent when correlated with clinical tests and arthroscopic findings, and is improved in equivocal cases with assessment of secondary signs for ACL tear. The MR imaging assessment of partial and chronic ACL tears is less accurate but is clinically useful. MR imaging provides information about associated injuries prior to surgery. Radiologic diagnostic methods for the assessment of ACL tears on MR images are well established; recent techniques such as dedicated cartilage imaging offer new information of use to clinicians about the sequelae of ACL injuries.

### Optimizing knee joint imaging: a comparative study of 7T MRI sequences [^117BiVkZ]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To reduce long scan durations and improve patient comfort while maintaining image quality by assessing varying 7 T MRI sequences to optimize knee joint imaging.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, healthy participants underwent knee joint scans using 7 T proton density fat-saturated (PD-FS), 3-dimensional double-echo steady-state (3D-DESS), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences. We evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of cartilage, meniscus, ligaments, synovial fluid, and adipose tissue and the imaging quality of cartilage, meniscus, and ligaments. Also, we assessed the concurrence reached by two independent evaluators using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

Twenty participants [mean age, 25.6 years ± 8.4 (SD); 13 women] were evaluated. The 3D-DESS sequence demonstrated the highest SNR for cartilage, ligament, joint fluid, and meniscus structures (P < .001). It performed similarly to the PD sequence for fat but outperformed the SWI sequence. The CNR analysis revealed that 3D-DESS produced the highest contrast between joint fluid and other structures (P < .001), followed by PD-FS, whereas SWI exhibited the lowest contrast. The SWI sequence demonstrated superior CNR between ligament and fat (P < .001). The PD-FS sequence exhibited the highest CNR between cartilage and meniscus (P < .001). Both observers reported substantial concordance in their evaluations (ICC > 0.7). The cartilage visualization was excellent in all sequences, with the SWI sequence displaying slight superiority (P < .05). The ligament and meniscus images were of the highest quality when using PD-FS (P < .001).

Conclusion

A combination of PD-FS and 3D DESS sequences is recommended for comprehensive and comfortable 7 T MRI assessments of knee joints, ensuring detailed visualization of various vital knee structures.

### First in-vivo magic angle directional imaging using dedicated low-field MRI [^112gQ6uN]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have successfully demonstrated the MA MRI system based on a rotatable low‐field magnet and obtained in vivo volume images of a sufficient quality for their use in the proposed method. We have successfully applied the MADI method to those images to produce highly encouraging collagen tractography results. Prior to this work, the condition of highly aligned collagen structures in MRI were predominately identified by negative contrast using a fluid sensitive sequence or contrast agents such as intra‐articular gadolinium injection to identify defects in known structures such as the ACL. For the first time, we can now image highly aligned collagen structures directly and with further work potentially negating the need for routine fluid weighted sequences for the identification of defects or injuries We believe that application of this method could lead to significant improvement in the diagnostic accuracy for MRI for ligaments, tendons, menisci, and other tissues consisting of collagen structures. Being low‐field, MA‐MRI is inherently low‐cost in comparison with conventional hospital MRI systems, and this could be a significant factor to facilitate its future adoption.

### Learning co-plane attention across MRI sequences for diagnosing twelve types of knee abnormalities [^117KXuQe]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The knee joint is a complex hinge joint and one of the main load-bearing joints of the human body, supporting the completion of complex movements in daily activities. Various knee abnormalities can arise from aging or injury, including meniscal tears, cartilage damage, anterior cruciate ligament tear, posterior cruciate ligament injury, medial collateral ligament injury, lateral collateral ligament injury, patellar retinaculum injury, infrapatellar fat pad injury, synovial plica, cysts (such as popliteal cyst, ganglion cyst, meniscus cyst, and synovial cyst), bone contusion, and joint effusion. These 12 types of knee abnormalities are relatively common and often result in knee pain and dysfunction, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and psychological well-being and imposing a substantial social cost –. Different types of knee abnormalities often occur together but are best treated with quite different methods: mild abnormalities (e.g. bone contusion, infrapatellar fat pad injury, and effusion) usually require only conservative treatment and follow-up observation; and severe abnormalities (e.g. anterior cruciate ligament tear and meniscal tear) require surgical treatment. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis of knee abnormalities is crucial for developing personalized treatment plans and improving the overall quality of life for patients.

Arthroscopy is widely considered the gold standard for diagnosing the pathology of knee abnormalities. However, this inspection method cannot detect some knee abnormalities located outside the joint cavity (e.g. bone contusion, infrapatellar fat pad injury, and patellar retinaculum injury)and carries the risk of additional trauma and serious complications (e.g. joint infection and deep vein thrombosis) –. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method for accurate evaluation of knee pathology and provides results comparable to those of arthroscopy. In addition to conventional T1- and T2-weighted (T1W and T2W) imaging sequences, knee MRI requires proton density-weighted (PDW) imaging sequence because of its high signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution to accurately detect abnormalities. However, knee MRI interpretation is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Some subtle lesions of the knee joint can easily be overlooked by radiologists with insufficient work experience. Therefore, automatic methods have a huge clinical demand for accurate diagnosis of knee abnormalities.

### Health technology assessment of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee [^115ynPt7]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

A search of the available literature was performed and the role of MR imaging of the knee is discussed. Based on this search the authors concluded that MR has a high sensitivity in detecting any abnormalities in the knee but it does not have the same diagnostic accuracy as a clinical investigation performed by a trained knee specialist when all knee injuries are taken together. It does lead to a decrease in the number of surgical interventions due to its high negative predictive value. For the detection of meniscal injury, MR has the same accuracy as arthroscopy and should be performed in order to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions. A negative MR also obviates further investigation in suspected cartilage damage. This is not true for anterior and posterior cruciate ligament problems where MRI is less accurate than clinical investigation.

### Evaluation and management of traumatic knee injuries in the emergency department [^115SwUaP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic knee pain is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The use of clinical decision rules can rule out reliably fractures of the knee and reduce the unnecessary cost and radiation exposure associated with plain radiographs. If ligamentous or meniscal injury to the knee is suspected, the ED physician should arrange for expedited follow- up with the patient's primary care physician or an orthopedic specialist for consideration of an MRI and further management. Patients presenting after high-energy mechanisms are at risk for occult fracture and vascular injuries. ED providers must consider these injuries in the proper clinical setting.

### Diagnostic value of DECT-based colored collagen maps for the assessment of cruciate ligaments in patients with acute trauma [^113YD6jz]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 100 patients considered for study inclusion, 15 patients were excluded due to suspected or known malignancy (n = 4), inflammatory conditions (n = 3), and inadequate imaging quality due to metallic implants (n = 8) (Fig. 1). Therefore, a total of 85 patients who had undergone non-contrast third-generation dual-source DECT of the knee joint followed by MRI (n = 78) or arthroscopic inspection (n = 34) were finally included in this study (50 male and 35 female, mean age, 44 ± 16 years; range, 14–89 years; Table 1). Seven patients did not undergo MRI prior to arthroscopy. Both MRI and arthroscopic inspection were available as a reference standard in 27 patients. In two of these patients, arthroscopy revealed partial rupture of the ACL that were missed in MRI. No lesions of the PCL were missed in MRI. Together, the reference standards revealed an injury to the ACL in 21 patients (24.7%; complete tear = 11; partial tear = 4; avulsion fracture = 6) and the PCL in 10 patients (12.9%; complete tear = 1; partial tear = 0; avulsion fracture = 9). One patient had injury to the ACL and PCL. Using only MRI as the reference standard revealed injury to the ACL in 19 patients (complete tear = 11; partial tear = 2; avulsion = 6) and to the PCL in 10 patients (complete tear = 1; avulsion fracture = 9). No statistical significance was observed between the demographics of patients with injury to the cruciate ligaments and patients without injury. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The mean interval between dual-energy CT and MRI or arthroscopic inspection was 6 days (range, 0–13 days). Color-coded image reconstruction took on average 3 min (range, 1–5 min). An example case without injury to the cruciate ligaments is given in Fig. 2.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^115cGE21]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies and systematic reviews have been published about MRI of the knee and its structures, discussing detailed anatomy, imaging findings, and correlations between imaging and clinical findings. This paper includes evidence-based recommendations for a general radiologist regarding choice of imaging sequences and reporting basic MRI examinations of the knee. We recommend using clinicians' terminology when it is applicable to the imaging findings, for example, when reporting meniscal, ligament and tendon, or cartilage pathology. The intent is to standardise reporting language and to make reports less equivocal. The aim of the paper is to improve the usefulness of the MRI report by understanding the strengths and limitations of the MRI exam with regard to clinical correlation. We hope the implementation of these recommendations into radiological practice will increase diagnostic accuracy and consistency by avoiding pitfalls and reducing overcalling of pathology on MRI of the knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning and assessing studies to evaluate acute and chronic knee findings by advocating the use of unequivocal terminology and discussing the strengths and limitations of MRI examination of the knee. KEY POINTS:
- On MRI, the knee should be examined and assessed in three orthogonal imaging planes.
- The basic general protocol must yield T2-weighted fluid-sensitive and T1-weighted images.
- The radiological assessment should include evaluation of ligamentous structures, cartilage, bony structures and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, alignment, and incidental findings.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^111nUQWv]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Knee MRI for osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) with a known lesion on x-ray is presented as optional: "an MRI of the knee is an option to characterize the OCD lesion or when concomitant knee pathology is suspected such as meniscal pathology, ACL injury, or articular cartilage injury". The page lists "Strength of Recommendation: High", but the rationale states that "AAOS conducted a systematic review that identified two diagnostic studies" that were "evaluated as a Level II study" and "also evaluated as a Level II study"; it further notes that "both x-ray and MRI are good rule in tests and do not address the incremental diagnostic value of an MRI in the setting of known OCD determined by x-ray", concluding "therefore we downgraded the strength of this recommendation to limited".

Advanced imaging for acute meniscal tears — Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose acute meniscal tears because of its high accuracy, while CT arthrography or ultrasound can be used, particularly when MRI is not available or is contraindicated. Quality of evidence is High and the strength of recommendation is Strong. Diagnostic accuracy data report MRI sensitivity 0.93[0.71,0.99] and specificity 0.83 [0.45, 0.97] for the identification of acute meniscal pathology, with lateral meniscus having a higher specificity (0.94 [0.86,0.97] versus 0.78[0.66, 0.86]) and medial meniscus having a higher sensitivity (0.94[0.89, 0.97] versus 0.80 [0.70, 0.87]). For patients in which an MRI is contra-indicated, examples include cardiac implants (ie pacemaker), spinal implants, some dental implants, infusion pumps, or cochlear implants. Benefits and harms include MRI "avoiding any radiation or intervention (arthrogram)", "Ultrasound also presented with limited harm with added benefit when applicable", potential radiation harm from "computed tomography or a SPECT", with "particular harm… in those of childbearing age due to detrimental effects of radiation during pregnancy", and for arthrography "added risk with injection, which include infection and pain as well as intolerance (ie allergic reaction) to contrast".

### Pain following double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: correlation with morphological graft findings and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [^114u3USr]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the relationship between knee pain following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft placement with morphological graft findings and dynamic contrast enhancement as assessed at MRI.

Material and Methods

Following institutional review board approval, 37 consecutive patients with double-bundle ACL reconstruction were enrolled. Thirteen patients had pain and 24 were asymptomatic. Imaging was performed using a 1.5 T MRI machine an average of 7.6 months after surgery. Graft-related (increase signal intensity, abnormal orientation, discontinuity, cystic degeneration, anterior translation of lateral tibia, arthrofibrosis), and non-graft related causes of knee pain (meniscal tear, cartilage injury, loose bodies, and synovitis) were evaluated. During dynamic contrast enhancement analysis, peak enhancement (ePeak) was calculated by placing a region of interest at the osteoligamentous interface of each bundle. Student's t-test was used for continuous variables analysis and chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables analysis.

Results

There was no difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients regarding morphological graft-related or non-graft-related causes of knee pain. For dynamic contrast enhancement analysis, symptomatic patients had significantly lower ePeak values than asymptomatic patients in the anteromedial (p = 0.008) and posterolateral (p = 0.001) bundles or when using the higher ePeak value in either bundle (p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Morphological ACL graft findings as assessed at MRI could not be used to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, lower ePeak values had a significant association with knee pain. This may indicate poor neovascularization of the graft, potentially leading to graft failure.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1115FWoJ]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric orthopaedic injuries — plain radiography is the standard first-line modality, while MRI is an adjunct for occult or soft tissue pathology, and an acute MRI is rarely required. Plain radiography remains the standard and most cost-effective imaging for screening and characterizing osseous injuries, but it is well recognized that pediatric fractures can occur without radiographic abnormalities. The capability of MRI to demonstrate marrow edema, cartilage defects, and soft tissue injuries makes it an important adjunct in the further evaluation of trauma to the growing skeleton, and its value is especially noted in finding growth plate injuries, stress fractures, avulsion injuries, osteochondritis dissecans, transient patellar dislocation, and soft tissue injuries. An acute MRI is rarely required.

### How to optimize the use of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction [^114MzYzE]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most current diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected ACL injuries. It is an accurate, highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of ACL tears, graft tears and associated injuries. However, it can also be used for various other aspects of anatomic ACL reconstruction.

Methods

Special sequences as the oblique sagittal plane should be obtained from a parallel line to the lateral epicondyle, ensuring a proper visualization of both bundles of the ACL. Another special set of images, the oblique-coronal sequence, allows for the ACL long-axis evaluation. The coronal-oblique sequence increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing isolated AM or PL bundle injuries and also helps to visualize the proximal insertion of the bundles for haemorrhage and rupture.

Results

Quantitative measurements can be taken from a proper MRI protocol, so as to determine the rupture pattern; measure insertion site size, inclination angle and autograft size; and evaluate for post-operative complications. These parameters help surgeons to objectively decide for a better graft and technique for an individualized approach and to evaluate the anatomic placement of the graft.

Conclusions

MRI can be used in different ways, serving as a very valuable tool in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Special protocols can provide accurate visualization of the double-bundle anatomy. Objective parameters to aid in pre-operative decisions and graft's anatomic placement evaluation can be also extracted from the MR images.

### First in-vivo magic angle directional imaging using dedicated low-field MRI [^113zhGYP]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

MRI is commonly undertaken as an imaging modality for diagnosing conditions in joints, owing to its excellent soft tissue contrast and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. However, conventional MRI struggles with the imaging of ligaments, tendons, menisci, and articular cartilage, which largely consist of extracellular structures of highly organized collagen fibers. As much as 89% of the water present in these tissues is bound to collagen, making the unaveraged dipolar interactions of proton nuclear spins to be the dominant signal decay mechanism. This results in very shortandrelaxation times, low signal returns, and inherently low contrast. Diagnostic imaging of these structures is usually based on a negative contrast with adjacent t, variable amounts of mostly extracellular water in the form of local edema, hemorrhage, or joint fluid. However, reliance on the signal from these fluids to depict damage to the actual collagen structures leads to severe limits in the diagnostic accuracy. Conditions such as partial ligament tears and chronic injuries remain difficult to diagnose accurately and the accepted diagnostic gold standard is arthroscopy or open surgery, though these methods can be associated with complications and they are generally undertaken only as part of treatment.

In addition, these tissues exhibit strong field‐related anisotropy associated with the magic angle (MA) effect, whereby the amount of dipolar coupling is significantly reduced if the collagen fibers are oriented to the main fieldat an angle. Under these conditions, may be significantly extended and result in a significant, and often unexpected, increase in the observed signal. From the clinical perspective MA has been viewed as a source of artifacts, potentially leading to erroneous diagnosis of injury or disease. Healthy ligaments and tendons are expected to return low signal (dark), and any brighter regions may be caused by tissue damage or potentially by the MA effect. Therefore, efforts are usually made to minimize the MA effectby extending the echo time. The MA effect continues to be a subject of interesting new research related to its impact on MR of tissues such as articular cartilage, while improved theoretical models for anisotropicrelaxation mechanisms are also being sought.

### Imaging review of knee ligament reconstructions other than the anterior cruciate ligament [^115PwsF3]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessment of knee ligament reconstructions other than the anterior cruciate ligament is challenging due to limited data and continuously developing techniques. Imaging is vital to assessment, demonstrating expected postoperative findings, allowing detection of complications, and enabling differentiation of techniques from one another-information that is critical if revision is being contemplated. Stress radiography is useful for evaluating joint stability in the setting of ligament insufficiency. The three-dimensional and multiplanar reconstruction capabilities of CT are highly useful in multiligament reconstruction, allowing unhindered evaluation of the many intersecting bone tunnels. Susceptibility artifacts in MRI can be remedied by use of metal artifact reduction sequences. Each technique, graft, and choice of specific ligaments to reconstruct must be decided on a case-to-case basis. Anatomic reconstruction reproduces the native ligament's anatomy but is more technically complex. Nonanatomic reconstruction is easier to perform but potentially provides less stability. As for graft selection, an autograft weakens another knee stabilizer, but an allograft is more expensive and less readily available. The decision to perform a single-ligament versus combined-ligament reconstruction ultimately rests on the degree of instability and the desire to return to sport. In contrast to single-ligament reconstruction, combined-ligament procedures are at higher risk of postoperative stiffness, arthrofibrosis, and tunnel convergence. Renewed attention to repair along with improvements in patient selection and rehabilitation protocols may change the future of operative treatment of ligament injury, and along with it, radiologic appraisal and reporting. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Postoperative MR evaluation of chondral repair in the knee [^1163JMeL]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Articular cartilage abnormalities of the knee are a cause of significant patient morbidity. Several surgical techniques have been developed to treat these lesions to improve patient symptoms and to delay or prevent the development of osteoarthritis. MRI has been shown to be an accurate non-invasive test for the evaluation of articular cartilage injuries and for evaluating the postoperative knee following chondral repair. As these surgical repair techniques become more commonly performed, is important for radiologists to be familiar with the surgical techniques and the MRI appearance of the postoperative knee including both normal and abnormal findings. In this article, these chondral repair techniques will be reviewed as well those normal and abnormal MRI findings following these surgeries.

### In vivo contrast-enhanced micro MR-imaging of experimental osteoarthritis in the rabbit knee joint at 7.1T1 [^115hsQC8]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In this longitudinal MR study the early stages of joint pathology in two surgically-induced rabbit models of osteoarthritis (OA) were monitored by in vivo contrast-enhanced MRI at 7.1T. Qualitative and quantitative MR data were compared with macroscopic and microscopic findings.

Method

Scanning of mature, male New Zealand White rabbits (N = 12) was performed before surgery, and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after unilateral transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT), medial meniscectomy (ME), or sham operation. MR-images were simultaneously obtained of both knee joints after intravenous injection of Magnevist. We implemented a 2D T1-weighted (T1w) coronal, fat-saturated gradientecho protocol (68 x 138 microm2, slice thickness 1 mm). Additionally, consecutive 3D gradientecho images were obtained from two sham-operated and two rabbits of the ME group (234 x 273 x 234 microm(3)). ACLT animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks (N = 1), and 8 weeks (N = 3), ME animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks (N = 2), and 8 weeks (N = 4), and sham-operated animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks (N = 1) and 8 weeks (N = 1), respectively.

Results

Both OA models reflected important characteristics of the clinical picture of OA. With MR we were able to monitor time dependently the decline of synovial effusion and the formation of osteophytes. Morphologic MR examination showed a moderate to high accuracy for detecting synovial effusion (75%), meniscus (86%) and cruciate ligament (91%) lesions, and osteophytes (88%) as assessed by macroscopic examination. False-negative MR findings for gross macroscopic changes were due to the relative high slice thickness in 2D scans and the fact that the slices only covered the main weightbearing area of the femorotibial joint. Contour abnormalities of articular cartilage were not reliably detected. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant increase of cartilage signal intensity in medial tibial cartilage (48 ± 9% ACLT, and 29 ± 9% ME in 2D datasets) as compared to contralateral control knees in two-week scans. Signal enhancement persisted or increased at later dates.

Conclusion

With high-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI at 7.1T the time course of gross pathologic changes in rabbit knees with surgically induced OA can be monitored. Still insufficient spatial resolution and image contrast of the applied 2D protocols limit the sensitivity and prohibit detection of articular cartilage contour abnormalities. However, signal alterations in the cartilage layer indicate alterations of tissue composition at a very early stage of OA development. When used with 3D protocols, contrast-enhanced MRI offers a promising tool for qualitative and quantitative in vivo monitoring of OA in rabbit models.

### Development of a multi-task deep learning system for classification of nine common knee abnormalities on MRI: a large-scale, multicentre, stepwise validation study [^116FV4db]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Reference standard

MRI images were labeled for the presence or absence of nine types of common knee abnormalities, categorized into primary and secondary abnormalities. Primary abnormalities including meniscal tear, cartilage defect, and ACL tear, are (1) most frequently found in symptomatic knees, (2) strongly correlated with the patients' primary complaints, and (3) generally warrant surgical intervention rather than conservative treatment. In contrast, secondary abnormalities (including PCL injury, MCL injury, LCL injury, IFP injury, synovial plica, and cyst) are typically observed in conjunction with primary abnormalities, with their treatment approach determined by the underlying primary lesion. The definitions of nine knee abnormalities on MRI are described in Supplementary Table S2.

Each knee case was independently annotated by a panel of three musculoskeletal radiologists, adhering to a rigorous and standardized labeling procedure. The radiologists received specialized training and participated in weekly consensus meetings to ensure consistency and accuracy. Original radiology reports were used as supplementary information to support the annotation process and improve the reliability of the reference standard. Each knee MRI examination comprised more than 72 images randomly shuffled and queued before being reviewed. Two radiologists (Z.Y.X. and R.Z. with 5 and 18 years of experience in musculoskeletal radiology, respectively) independently annotated each case. After annotating a case, the radiologist proceeded to the next randomly assigned case. If the annotations were consistent, they were accepted as the reference standard. In cases of disagreement, an expert musculoskeletal radiologist (Y.H.Z. with 35 years of experience) reviewed and checked the discrepancy and made the final reference standard.

Inter-rater agreement between the musculoskeletal radiologists was assessed prior to the consensus review. Each radiologist independently assessed a randomly selected sample of 500 MRI examinations. Cohen's kappa values were used to quantify the agreement, with the following scale: 0–0.20, poor; 0.21–0.40, fair; 0.41–0.60, moderate; 0.61–0.80, substantial; and 0.80–1.00, excellent.

### US and MR imaging of the postoperative knee [^113ZHzTN]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Constantly increasing number of surgical procedures on the soft tissues of and around the knee generates the need for postoperative soft tissue assessment. Sports medicine is constantly seeking new — faster, better, more efficient — ways to help patients, especially competitive athletes to come back to their full activity as soon as possible. One of the important factors in that acceleration is postoperative tissue assessment. It helps the clinician making better decisions in terms of the rehabilitation stages, come back to basic and sport-specific training and finally in letting the patient put a full load on the operated structure. The healing of the collagen structure cannot only be guided by patient's pain. Diagnostic imaging methods such as US and MRI, which focus on the soft tissue assessment are best fitted to do the job. They also help in the diagnostics of the reinjuries of operated structures. Often criteria used for basic diagnostics do not fit the need of assessment of the structure which underwent an initial injury, was operated, healed and often reinjured again. Criteria used for regular injury diagnostics are in most cases seriously modified. Moreover the whole matter of structure evaluation after an injury and medical intervention leaves a lot of slippery ground and should be carefully studied before taking the challenge of judging the surgeon and the natural healing processes. Diagnostic judgment has much more impact on the operated patient than the primary injury diagnosis. Depending on the author both MRI and US are pointed out as the best imaging methods in terms of postoperative knee assessment. In fact both methods can be complementarily used in the postoperative follow up. Depending on the operated structure the choice of methods usually depends on local equipment availability and personal doctor's experience. MRI is probably best fitted for evaluation of the internal knee structures such as cruciate ligaments and hyaline cartilage on the tibia and patella. US is my choice always in the evaluation of the superficially located connective tissue structures, femoral cartilage and menisci. In both cases the learning curve is nearly flat, frustrating and dedicated to only those radiologist who know how their surgeon looks like with and without a surgical mask. Tight surgeon-radiologist cooperation and information exchange is essential in this kind of diagnostics.

### Pathologic conditions of the ligaments and tendons of the knee [^115LDuRQ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Excellent spatial resolution and unparalleled contrast resolution have allowed MRI to emerge as the dominant imaging modality for diagnosis of ligament and tendon pathology of the knee joint This article presents several important mechanisms of injury associated with tendon and ligament disruptions. When present, the pattern of bone contusions may reveal the vector of force. When one is aware of the mechanism of injury, it is possible to analyze systematically the structures of the knee and maximize the detection of pathology. Recognition of a knee dislocation pattern is important because the diagnosis may be unsuspected, and the clinician may have to be alerted to the possibility of vascular and neural injury.

### Measuring synovial thickness on knee MRI in pediatric patients with arthritis: is contrast necessary? [^116cMbwi]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of contrast-enhanced imaging has long been standard for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of synovitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). However, advancements in MRI technology have allowed for reliable identification of synovium without contrast.

Objective

To assess the equivalence of unenhanced MRI with contrast-enhanced MRI in evaluating synovial thickness.

Materials and Methods

This is an institutional review board approved, retrospective study performed in a tertiary children's hospital. Pediatric JIA patients under 21 years old were included who underwent knee MRI scans (1.5 T or 3 T) without and with contrast between January 2012 and January 2022. Two radiologists independently measured synovial thickness at 6 knee sites on contrast-enhanced and unenhanced sequences. Numerical measurements and ordinal scores based on juvenile idiopathic arthritis magnetic resonance imaging scoring (JAMRIS) system were recorded, and tests of equivalence were conducted, as well as between-reader and within-reader reliability by concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). All tests were considered significant at the 5% level.

Results

A total of 38 studies from 35 patients (25 females, median age 14 years; interquartile range 7 to 15.7) were included. Equivalence was demonstrated at each of the 6 sites for both continuous measurements (P-values < 0.05) and ordinal scores (P-values < 0.05) based on the average over readers. Within-reader reliability was moderate to high (CCC 0.50–0.89), except for the cruciate ligaments site. Averaged over the 6 sites, reliability between readers was low for unenhanced (CCC 0.47, with 95% CI: [0.41, 0.53]) and moderate for contrast-enhanced (CCC 0.64, with 95% CI: [0.59, 0.69]) sequences.

Conclusion

Unenhanced knee MRI is equivalent to contrast-enhanced MRI in assessment of synovial thickness using conventional MRI sequences. Contrast material helped improve inter-reader reliability.

### How to optimize the use of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction [^1166xN5L]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The goal of anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is the restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation and insertion sites. The ACL consists of two functional bundle, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PL), which together provide both anterior and rotatory stability of the knee.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most frequent diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected ACL injuries. It is an accurate, highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of ACL tears, graft tears and associated injuries. The application of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction is rapidly expanding. Currently, MRI is used not only for diagnosis, but also for the measurement of the size and inclination angle of the ACL, pre-operative assessment of the size of autograft sources and post-operative evaluation of graft healing. MRI has also been used in several other evaluations related to ACL reconstruction, such as tunnel enlargement, roof impingement, tibiofemoral relation and cartilage degenerative changes after ACL injury. This paper focuses on all applications of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction. It will also describe an MRI ACL protocol for ACL injury and reconstruction.

### Development of a multi-task deep learning system for classification of nine common knee abnormalities on MRI: a large-scale, multicentre, stepwise validation study [^1126iDBt]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The first advantage of our DLS lies in its comprehensive classification of nine common knee abnormalities on MRI. Previous DL studies often focused on isolated primary abnormalities (e.g. meniscal tear, cartilage injury, ACL tear) using single-centre datasets with smaller sample sizes (294–2287 cases) and arthroscopic confirmation, achieving AUCs of 0.847–0.980. In contrast, our large-scale multi-centre dataset included both arthroscopic and non-arthroscopic cases, with variations in MRI vendors, protocols, and patient demographics. This broader clinical perspective allowed our DLS to achieve an average AUC of 0.902 for primary abnormalities on the internal test set. Moreover, our DLS expanded to classify ligamentous injuries (e.g. PCL, MCL, LCL), which are underexplored in DL literature. It achieved 90.9%, 87.7%, and 91.2% accuracy for PCL, MCL, and LCL injuries, respectively, outperforming previous studies where radiologist accuracy was 84.5%, 69.1%, and 65.9%. Aligned with the European Society of Radiology's guidance that knee MRI interpretation should include bursae and soft tissues in addition to menisci, ligament, and cartilage, our DLS covered bursal/soft-tissue entities (e.g. IFP injury, synovial plica, and cyst) and classified them successfully. It matched senior radiologists' performance in classifying meniscus tear, ACL tear, and MCL injury, and demonstrated comparable accuracy to junior radiologists for cartilage and cyst classifications. The findings underscore its clinical value in enhancing diagnostic precision and guiding treatment decisions for knee abnormalities.

A widely used DLS should be equitable and beneficial for all patients. In our analysis of the external dataset II, the DLS demonstrated superior performance in identifying meniscal tear in patients over 40 years old. However, we hypothesize that these results may not be solely age-related. A detailed review of knee images revealed that numerous false-positive cases were linked to the partial volume effect, where surrounding small blood vessels mimicked meniscal tears (Supplementary Fig. S14). Other anatomical structures, such as the transverse meniscal ligament, the meniscofemoral ligaments (Humphrey and Wrisberg), popliteomeniscal fascicles, and arterial pulsation artifacts, also resembled meniscal tears. These findings highlight areas for future model improvement, such as including a broader array of normal anatomical structures that can mimic meniscal tear in the training dataset.

### Multidetector computed tomography arthrography of the knee: diagnostic accuracy and indications [^115wzDdw]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and indications of arthrography with multidetector computed tomography (arthro-MDCT) of the knee, in patients with absolute or relative contraindications to MRI and in patients with periarticular metal implants using diagnostic arthroscopy as the gold standard.

Materials and Methods

After intra-articular injection of iodixanol and volumetric acquisition, 68 knees in patients of both sexes (30 females, 38 males, age range 32–60 years) were examined with a 16-detector-row CT scanner. The patients had arthralgia but no radiologically detected fractures. They could not be studied by MRI either because of absolute contraindications (subcutaneous electronic implants), surgical metal implants or claustrophobia. In 37 of 68 patients who had had previous knee surgery, the arthro-CT examination was preceded by an MRI on the same day. All examinations were interpreted by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. The findings were compared with arthroscopic findings carried out within 28 days of the CT study.

Results

In non-operated patients the comparison between arthro-MDCT and arthroscopy showed sensitivity and specificity ranging between 86% and 100%. In the 37 operated knees, arthro-MDCT had an accuracy of 95% compared with 53% of the MRI. Inter-observer agreement was almost perfect (K = 0.97) in the evaluation of all types lesions, both on MDCT and MRI. When arthro-MDCT was compared with MRI in post-operative patients by a McNemar test, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between these two techniques.

Conclusions

Arthro-MDCT of the knee is a safe technique that provides accurate diagnosis in identifying chondral, fibrocartilaginous and intra-articular ligamentous lesions, in patients that cannot be evaluated by MRI, and in patients after surgical.

### Basketball injuries [^111XZZLP]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Basketball injuries are most prevalent in the lower extremity, especially at the ankle and knee. Most basketball injuries are orthopedic in nature and commonly include ligament sprains, musculotendinous strains, and overuse injuries including stress fractures. By virtue of its excellent contrast resolution and depiction of the soft tissues and trabecular bone, magnetic resonance imaging has become the principal modality for evaluating many basketball injuries. In this article, commonly encountered basketball injuries and their imaging appearances are described. The epidemiology of basketball injuries across various age groups and levels of competition and between genders are reviewed.

### Advanced MR imaging of the cruciate ligaments [^114WcqhQ]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are crucial stabilizers of the knee. These ligaments are named by the location of their tibial attachments. Each ligament is composed of separate functional bundles that differ in size but are equally important in function. MR imaging is accurate and sensitive, making it the imaging technique of choice for evaluating these ligaments. Acute and chronic injuries involving the cruciate ligaments have typical appearances and associated findings. MR imaging interpretation must take into account atypical injuries and imaging pitfalls. Knowledge of normal ligament reconstruction techniques allows differentiation of the normal postoperative appearance from reconstruction failure and complications. Ligament reconstruction techniques, complications, and appearances are reviewed in this article.

### Diagnostic value of DECT-based colored collagen maps for the assessment of cruciate ligaments in patients with acute trauma [^116p6sjF]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This retrospective study has certain limitations we would like to address. First, because patients with fractures or a high probability of damage to the internal structures of the knee did not routinely receive MRI before surgical inspection, we used a mixed reference standard comprising MRI and/or arthroscopic inspection. Nevertheless, MRI represents the current imaging gold standard for cruciate ligament assessment besides arthroscopy; thus, we decided to include each patient undergoing at least one of both reference standards. Interestingly, the diagnostic accuracy was significantly increased when arthroscopy was available as a reference standard. We believe that this is not a technical issue but rather attributable to the fact that the prevalence of ligamentous injury was significantly higher in patients where arthroscopy was performed, and that the sustained injuries of these patients were more severe and readily picked up in imaging. This is underlined by the fact that the use of MRI as a single reference standard did not lead to a reduction of diagnostic accuracy. Nonetheless, further studies with larger patient's cohorts should be performed to gain more insights into this finding. Second, we evaluated the incremental diagnostic value of third-generation dual-source DECT-derived color-coded collagen reconstructions over third-generation dual-source DECT grayscale images. Due to improved material differentiation, soft-tissue contrast has also improved significantly for standard grayscale images. Therefore, the incremental diagnostic value of collagen reconstructions over single-energy CT or previous generations of dual-source DECT could be underestimated from the results of this study. Last, the color-coded collagen reconstruction algorithm used in our study is vendor-specific; and therefore, the results of our study cannot be generalized, although all major vendors offer dual-energy CT.

In conclusion, our study shows that third-generation dual-source DECT color-coded collagen reconstructions substantially improve diagnostic accuracy for the detection of acute complete and partial tears of the cruciate ligaments of the knee compared to standard grayscale images, with inexperienced readers benefiting the most. Color-coded reconstructions demonstrate good agreement with MRI and achieve superior diagnostic confidence, image quality, and noise scores compared to grayscale CT for all readers. Therefore, we believe this algorithm may become a viable alternative for assessing the cruciate ligaments when MRI is unavailable, but dual-energy CT can be performed.

### Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the cruciate ligaments [^115d5nwn]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament are key stabilizers of the knee. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging excels at depiction of injury in both the native and reconstructed cruciate ligaments as well as associated injuries. This article reviews the anatomy, injury patterns, and relevant surgical techniques crucial to making accurate interpretation of MR imaging of the cruciate ligaments.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the collateral ligaments and the anatomic quadrants of the knee [^113VqLiS]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Injuries to the lateral and medial supporting structures of the knee can be significantly disabling and somewhat difficult to detect and evaluate clinically. An accurate imaging evaluation of these structures requires the use of the appropriate MR imaging sequences and the detailed knowledge of the anatomic structures that are present in these locations. Normal function is dependent on the integrity of the complex functional structures and effective clinical treatment, including surgical repair, of these structures is predicated on an optimal diagnostic evaluation. A successful diagnostic evaluation can expedite treatment and provide the best opportunity for a favorable long-term outcome.

### MRI deep learning models for assisted diagnosis of knee pathologies: a systematic review [^112gC3Pv]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knee injuries are a prevalent health concern globally, affecting both paediatric and adult populations. Current diagnosis involves clinical examination followed by imaging such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is crucial in diagnosing knee injuries due to its superior soft tissue contrast resolution. In-plane two-dimensional (2D) MRI knee studies are typically acquired in three orthogonal planes using a combination of sequences. While 2D knee MRI is useful for assessing various conditions, its limitations include restricted spatial resolution, partial volume effect (PVE), and geometrical constraints that may limit a thorough interrogation of selected small features of knee injuries. Additionally, 2D MRI does not allow image reconstruction onto arbitrary anatomical planes.

Advanced MRI sequences like three-dimensional (3D) MRI can gather larger data sets offering additional information compared to 2D MRI. 3D MRI sequences capture data volumes with higher spatial resolution and reduced PVE. Moreover, it enables image reconstruction on arbitrary diagnostic planes. Despite the radiologist's preference for multi-sequence 2D MRI due to their enhanced contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the traditional limitations of 3D MRI including longer scan times are now mitigated through high magnetic field scanners and compressed sensing techniques that expedite scan time. Furthermore, the recent application of deep-learning (DL) denoising algorithms into 3D MRI sequences has promised to deliver excellent improvements in CNR.

Interpreting knee MRI images requires significant experience. While proficient radiologists exhibit good diagnostic accuracy in knee MRI exams, attaining such expertise demands rigorous training. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a transformative force in the field of medical imaging. DL, a sub-field of AI, is capable of leveraging advanced image pattern recognition capabilities to detect abnormalities and has the potential to revolutionise the way we approach MRI analysis and the classification of injuries and diseases. Today, a growing number of DL models for radiology applications are being developed using different convolutional neural network (CNN) infrastructures, training and validation techniques.

In the context of knee MRI, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of training DL models with MRI data to help clinicians with limited expertise in assessing knee injuries. Nevertheless, the precision of DL models for diagnosis remains under investigation. This systematic review aims to summarise the status of the DL MRI models developed for the classification and assisted diagnosis of common knee injuries and diseases.

### Imaging of the knee in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114LCPGs]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging

Within the last decade, the use of MRI and advances in MRI techniques have substantially improved the evaluation of joint pathologies in children with JIA. MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory and destructive changes in JIA as compared to conventional radiography, ultrasonography and physical examination. Furthermore, MRI is the only imaging modality that is useful in visualizing bone marrow changes, a potential predictor of erosive joint damage in JIA, as previously demonstrated in adults. Therefore despite practical limitations, MRI holds the potential to become an important outcome measure for assessing the knee joint in clinical trials of children with JIA.

Main MRI features and imaging protocol

In children with JIA and knee involvement, the main imaging features include synovial thickening, joint effusion and bone marrow oedema. Moreover cartilage loss and bone erosions — although relatively rare in paediatric patients — can be observed. Tendinopathy, enthesopathy, inhomogeneity of the infra-patellar fat pad and bone cysts can be seen, as well, but these abnormalities are relatively uncommon in the knee joint. Moreover, the reliability of scoring these secondary features is unsatisfactory. Table 3 shows an MRI protocol for evaluating the JIA knee joint.

Table 3
Knee MRI protocol

*mDixon best option if available

FS fat-suppressed, Gd gadolinium, PD proton density, STIR short tau inversion recovery, T1 T1-weighted spin echo, T2 T2-weighted

Synovial inflammation leading to synovial thickening is the principal pathological process in JIA, and the presence of synovial thickening on knee MRI is associated with the clinical onset of JIA. On MRI, the inflamed synovial membrane is thickened and irregular, and its outline may be wavy. In the knee, a synovial thickness of > 2 mm is considered pathological. The central locations in the knee (around the cruciate ligaments and retropatellar and suprapatellar areas, Fig. 2) are most commonly affected. The signal intensity of this thickened synovial membrane is low to intermediate on T1-weighted images and high on T2-weighted images, similar to joint effusion. T1-weighted images after administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents provide better differentiation between joint effusion and synovial thickening. Omitting intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents in the MRI assessment of joints in JIA is therefore not advised.

### How useful is MRI in diagnosing isolated bundle ACL injuries? [^116R4PB1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Selective bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and/or remnant ACL preservation may be reasonable options for some patients. However, the frequency of isolated anteromedial (AM) or posterolateral (PL) bundle injuries in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction is unknown, and the value of MRI for prediction of this injury pattern is likewise unknown.

Questions/Purposes

We sought to determine (1) the proportion of knees with an intact AM or PL bundle in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction; (2) whether MRI predicted the bundle conditions seen at the time of surgery; and (3) whether the accuracy of the MRI prediction was affected by the timing of MRI after injury.

Methods

During primary ACL reconstructions of 156 knees, conditions of AM and PL bundles were separately examined and classified into three categories: (1) completely torn; (2) attenuated; and (3) intact. Then, the bundles were assessed by blinded observers on MRI and classified into the corresponding three categories for 77 patients who had an MRI at our institution using a standard protocol. Diagnostic accuracy of MRI was computed, and the early MRI group (≤ 6 weeks from injury to MRI acquisition) was compared with the late MRI group (> 6 weeks).

Results

Only 11 (7%) of the 156 knees we treated had an intact AM (one knee) or PL bundle (10 knees). Another 55 knees (35%) had a structurally continuous but attenuated AM or PL bundle. The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI was 83%; accuracy was better for the AM bundle than the PL bundle (91% versus 78%; p = 0.026). MR prediction was less accurate in the early MRI group, particularly for PL bundle injury.

Conclusions

An isolated bundle tear is uncommon in patients with ACL tears undergoing reconstruction. MRI can help surgeons predict bundle injury pattern with satisfactory precision, but caution should be used in predicting PL bundle injury using MRI with early acquisition time from injury.

### Intensity of signal contacting meniscal surface in recurrent tears on MR arthrography compared with that of contrast material [^112pSuYZ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Several previous studies reported that the signal contacting the meniscal surface in a recurrent tear on MR arthrography had intensity equal to that of intraarticular contrast material. Because we failed to diagnose recurrent tears using this criterion, we reviewed our knee MR arthrograms in patients who had prior meniscal surgery.

Conclusion

On knee MR arthrograms, the signal contacting the surface of a recurrent meniscal tear may be equal to or less than that of adjacent intraarticular gadolinium contrast material.

### Cartilage and soft tissue imaging using X-rays: propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography of the human knee in comparison with clinical imaging techniques and histology [^115Fih3d]. Investigative Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluates high-resolution tomographic x-ray phase-contrast imaging in whole human knee joints for the depiction of soft tissue with emphasis on hyaline cartilage. The method is compared with conventional computed tomography (CT), synchrotron radiation absorption-based CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Material and Methods

After approval of the institutional review board, 2 cadaveric human knees were examined at an synchrotron institution using a monochromatic x-ray beam of 60 keV, a detector with a 90-mm field of view, and a pixel size of 46 × 46 μm. Images of phase-contrast imaging CT were reconstructed with the filtered back projection algorithm and the equally sloped tomography method. Image quality and tissue contrast were evaluated and compared in all modalities and with histology.

Results

Phase-contrast imaging provides visualization of altered cartilage regions invisible in absorption CT with simultaneous high detail of the underlying bony abnormalities. The delineation of surface changes is similar to 3-T MRI using cartilage-dedicated sequences. Phase-contrast imaging CT presents soft tissue contrast surpassing that of conventional CT with a clear discrimination of ligamentous, muscular, neural, and vascular structures. In addition, phase-contrast imaging images show cartilage and meniscal calcifications that are not perceptible on conventional CT or on MRI.

Conclusions

Phase-contrast imaging CT may facilitate a more complete evaluation of the human knee joint by providing concurrent comprehensive information about cartilage, the underlying subchondral bone, and their changes in osteoarthritic conditions.

### Feasibility of an accelerated 2D-multi-contrast knee MRI protocol using deep-learning image reconstruction: a prospective intraindividual comparison with a standard MRI protocol [^112qgUw8]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is among the most commonly performed MRI examinations and requires about 15 min of acquisition time. Reference standards for knee MRI are proton density (PD)– and T1–weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences due to the excellent tissue contrast and high in-plane spatial resolution with good assessment of meniscal, ligamentous, and cartilaginous injuries.

Due to their anisotropic voxel size, two-dimensional (2D)–TSE sequences require the acquisition of different image planes separately, which is time consuming. One approach to accelerate MRI of the knee is three-dimensional (3D)–TSE techniques, generating isotropic data sets of higher spatial resolution to create virtually any image plane from a single parental data set. Although technical developments can provide accelerated imaging, mainly based on parallel imaging (PI) acceleration, the acquisition time of a high-quality isotropic data set with 3D–TSE requires still around 5 to 10 min. Besides, with increasing acceleration in PI, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases rapidly, while residual artifacts are generally increased which limits the achievable speed.

Another innovative technique, which is commonly used to accelerate MRI, is compressed sensing (CS), in which only a reduced set of data points is required. SNR is preserved better than by PI only, but CS tends to oversimplify image content, resulting in residual blurring and loss of realistic image textures.

The latest promising approaches to overcome this drawback are deep-learning (DL) algorithms. These feature trainable components in contrast to a priori assumptions on sparsity and promise higher acceleration factors while simultaneously increasing SNR and preserving high image quality. With regard to MRI of the knee, a recently published study using retrospectively undersampled data showed that DL images perform interchangeably with standard clinical images for the detection of internal derangement of the knee. Furthermore, retrospectively undersampled, DL–accelerated images were rated with higher image quality than standard imaging and allowed an acceleration of the standard images. There have been other technical developments of the DL reconstruction recently, but so far, there has been no prospective clinical study at both 1.5 and 3 T.

Our hypothesis was that TSE DL can produce similar image quality that is comparable to clinically used segmented sequences while significantly reducing the acquisition time. Therefore, we implemented TSE DL at 1.5 and 3 T in a prospective study to assess diagnostic performance compared to standard imaging sequences in routine clinical practice.

### MR imaging of acute knee injuries: systematic evaluation and reporting [^114iCMn3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute knee injury ranges among the most common joint injuries in professional and recreational athletes. Radiographs can detect joint effusion, fractures, deformities, and malalignment; however, MR imaging is most accurate for radiographically occult fractures, chondral injury, and soft tissue injuries. Using a structured checklist approach for systematic MR imaging evaluation and reporting, this article reviews the MR imaging appearances of the spectrum of traumatic knee injuries, including osteochondral injuries, cruciate ligament tears, meniscus tears and ramp lesions, anterolateral complex and collateral ligament injuries, patellofemoral translation, extensor mechanism tears, and nerve and vascular injuries.

### Anatomy of the knee… [^1173pPzN]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Knee Ligament Injuries No validated rules have been formulated for the use of radiography in patients with suspected ligament injuries, but a decision tree can be used as a guide. ACL injury has three main radiographic signs: avulsion of the intercondylar tubercle, anterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur, termed the "radiographic drawer sign, " and Segond fracture, termed the "lateral capsular sign" 16. Note, however, that these radiographic signs are frequently absent in patients with ACL injuries. In one study, 22 the gravity sign near extension correctly diagnosed PCL injury in 20 of 24 patients, and active reduction of posterior tibial subluxation correctly identified PCL injury in 18 of 24 patients. The gravity test is performed at 20 degrees of knee flexion. Neither maneuver requires anesthesia.

Nonetheless, clinical diagnosis may be difficult, and radiographic signs are important. 18 The most common radiographic sign of PCL injury is avulsion at the site of the ligament's origin on the posterior tibia. Less commonly, avulsion can be seen at the site of PCL insertion at the medial femoral condyle. When the PCL fails, posterior sagging of the tibia relative to the femur may be seen on the lateral radiograph. MRI is accurate in diagnosing PCL injuries. It can also show associated injuries of the ACL and medial collateral ligament, as well as bone contusions. MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT Knee injuries involving valgus force, with or without a rotational element, are suggestive of MCL injury. The physical examination may demonstrate effusion or local soft tissue swelling and ecchymosis. 18 Injuries to the MCL usually occur at the ligament's proximal origin. Therefore, tenderness is usually localized along the distal femur and extends to the joint line.
17.

The major secondary radiographic sign of MCL injury is widening of the medial joint space. A lateral tibial plateau fracture may also suggest MCL injury. MRI demonstrates MCL injury as well as associated injuries of the medial meniscus, capsule and ACL. LATERAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENTOUS COMPLEX.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences? [^1132NCPD]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in MRI hard- and software development and the resulting improved image quality as well as image interpretation using artificial intelligence programs will likely help to better assess unenhanced images. This study contributes to the re-evaluation of the need and benefit of contrast agents in monitoring the disease activity of JIA. Hemke et al reported that the reliability of the JAMRIS score for the assessment of synovial thickening decreases when omitting contrast agents in MRI examinations of the knee at 1 Tesla. Based on our data, no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy when using enhanced or unenhanced images could be found when using the clinical JADAS10 as a reference. In our study, we not only compared unenhanced and enhanced images but also included PD-weighted MRI, so it is possible to hypothesize that the accuracy of unenhanced images can be increased by additional evaluation of PD-weighted sequences. Furthermore, the higher magnetic field strength of 3 Tesla used in our study might lead to improved spatial resolution compared to a magnetic field strength of 1 Tesla used by Hemke et al. Nevertheless, a recent review published on behalf of the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) arthritis subcommittee and the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) indicated that diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced MRI is limited compared to contrast-enhanced MRI due to the reduced ability to evaluate synovitis. In this article, recommendations are based on the literature review (among others: Hemke et al) and/or expert opinion. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating equal accuracy for the detection of active disease in JIA patients in unenhanced and enhanced 3 Tesla MRI.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^11436asj]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid-sensitive sequences can vary considerably and the choice of weighting must be adjusted according to scanner and local preference of the reporting radiologist. In acute knee trauma, an MRI should always be accompanied by a radiograph (or computer tomography) of the knee to avoid missing small bony avulsions. If bone marrow pathology is detected first on MRI, radiographs or CT may be performed to supplement the MRI if the diagnosis is uncertain. This should not be misinterpreted as "radiographs are unnecessary", or that MRI of the knee should be the first modality regardless of clinical indication. Level of evidence of recommendation: 4/Low.

Clinical indications for knee MRI

The optimal use of MRI is best decided in conjunction with key local stakeholders, but there are some overarching principles. MRI of the knee is indicated in acute knee trauma with suspected internal derangement and in the course of posttraumatic assessment. It is also indicated in clinically unexplained chronic knee pain, when prior radiographs are non-diagnostic. Some imaging centres vary their knee MRI protocols according to the clinical query. However, even though clinical history improves MRI diagnostics, important incidental or concomitant findings may be missed if all structures are not routinely evaluated.

Basic image assessment

The assessment should include evaluation of the menisci (including roots), ligamentous structures and tendons, cartilage, bone and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, and femorotibial and patellar alignment, as well as any incidental findings. In the following section, when referring to T1, T2, or PD images, this also includes Dixon images which are derived from post-processing and reconstructed with various weightings.

Menisci

The lateral and medial menisci are semicircular fibrocartilage structures between the tibia and femur which function as shock absorbers and provide stability to the knee joint. Anteriorly and posteriorly, they both are attached to the tibia with meniscal roots. On MRI, menisci are best appreciated on coronal and sagittal images. They appear as homogenous low-signal triangular structures when normal on T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images. They can also be appreciated well on transverse images, where the semicircular form is seen. Pathology is seen as high signal lines that run horizontally, vertically (subdivided into radial or longitudinally), or complex (Fig. 1 A–E). It is important to recognise lesions that require surgical treatment, as locking of the knee due to meniscal flaps or fragments damages the cartilage.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the pediatric knee [^116CQSMk]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In pediatric patients, the high resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for complete evaluation of osseous and soft-tissue structures around the knee joint, and its lack of ionizing radiation makes it a preferred modality for advanced imaging. Older children and adolescents are most commonly imaged to evaluate athletic and traumatic injuries, whereas in infants and school age children MR imaging is used to evaluate developmental conditions such as Blount disease or assess for causes of atraumatic pain such as infection or inflammatory arthritis. A thorough understanding of normal skeletal development is necessary to avoid misdiagnoses.

### Is simultaneous multisection turbo spin echo ready for clinical MRI? A feasibility study on fast imaging of knee lesions [^116XQerw]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the image quality and diagnostic accuracy of simultaneous multiple-section (SMS) turbo spin echo (TSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gradient-based "controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration" (CAIPIRINHA) for lesions of the knee.

Materials and Methods

This prospective study included 10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients scanned at 3 T using SMS (a prototype) and conventional TSE sequences for T1 and proton-density (PD)-weighted imaging (with fat saturation). MRI images of volunteers were evaluated using a five-point score based on artefacts, and visualisation of the bone, cartilage, ligaments, and menisci. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of ligament/bone, meniscus/bone, and cartilage/bone on T1-weighted images, as well as ligament/effusion, meniscus/effusion, cartilage/effusion, and bone/effusion on PD-weighted images (with fat saturation) were compared for better contrast. The SMS images for diagnosis of lesions of the knee were also evaluated using another five-point score: image sharpness, depiction of lesions, relationship to surrounding structures, and overall artefacts in the lesions.

Results

Compared to conventional TSE sequences, SMS provides similar diagnostic accuracy with significantly reduced scan time. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative analysis showed a comparable image quality between these two sequences except for the aliasing artefacts near the coil edges and CNR of cartilage/bone in T1-weighted images in SMS.

Conclusion

Compared to conventional TSE sequences, SMS requires shorter scan times and offers similar image quality and diagnostic accuracy. SMS is valuable for MRI examinations of the knee.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113NWopa]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

X-ray, MRI, CT, Bone Scan

X-ray: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, radiographs should be the initial imaging modality utilized for the evaluation of knee pain. Radiographs provide adequate evaluation of the joint space, osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation, displaced or chronic stress fractures, joint effusions, and sclerosis in the subarticular region.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If radiographs are normal, or demonstrate a joint effusion, the ACR recommends an MRI without intravenous (IV) contrast as the next most appropriate study. MRI accurately demonstrates the soft tissues of the knee, without the use of ionizing radiation, and depicts tendon and ligamentous damage, tears and other abnormalities of the meniscus, the presence of synovitis, the extent of effusions, the presence and/or rupture of a popliteal cyst, the extent of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, subchondral insufficiency fractures, tibial stress fractures, and osteonecrosis.
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or a joint effusion is detected. However, the utilization of IV contrast may be beneficial to help more accurately diagnose such causes of chronic knee pain as infrapatellar bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome ("runner's knee"), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), and Hoffa's fat pad syndrome.
Computed tomography (CT): While not a first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of knee pain, according to the ACR, under certain circumstances, a CT without IV contrast may be indicated for the evaluation of knee pain, especially in settings where MRI may be contraindicated (ie, in a patient with a non-MRI compatible pacemaker, spinal column stimulator, or deep brain stimulator). CT offers enhanced bony detail and may be useful to confirm a prior osseous injury such as a subtle acute non-displaced fracture or chronic stress fracture. In the setting of chronic knee pain related to patellofemoral syndrome, CT may be helpful in evaluating the patellofemoral anatomy.CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated but may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies.
Bone scan: Bone scan is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with knee pain. Bone scan has low specificity and decreased anatomic resolution when compared to CT or MRI. However, bone scan may help to distinguish between bone and soft-tissue origins for pain.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not often useful as a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive examination of the knee. It may be appropriate to use ultrasound to confirm a suspected effusion or popliteal cyst, and can be utilized to guide in aspiration of synovial fluid which can be evaluated for crystal disease or infection. It also may be utilized to evaluate for synovial pathology, where the use of power Doppler ultrasound can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow that is associated with knee pain. Ultrasound is also useful for following patients with iliotibial (IT) band syndrome and in evaluating medial plicae. Ultrasound can also demonstrate an extrusion of the meniscus (with is suggestive of an underlying meniscal tear) and, on occasion, can detect peripheral meniscus tears, and chondrocalcinosis.

### Reassessing the role of MRI in the evaluation of knee pain… [^111UjoWy]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Several studies have shown that MRI may identify signal change that suggests a meniscal tear when the meniscus is not actually torn. 1 Other studies have shown that even when a meniscal tear is detected, it may not be related to the presenting symptoms. 2, 3 Research suggests that a fairly high percentage of arthroscopic procedures may be performed based on abnormal MRI findings instead of clinical findings.
4. A thorough patient history and physical examination combined with plain radiography are effective in differentiating surgical knee pathology from nonoperative, patellofemoral knee pain. 1, 5 Most patients with knee symptoms have patellofemoral knee pain or some other form of tendinitis and do not require surgery. MRI is not needed to differentiate a patient with patellofemoral pain or tendinitis from one who requires surgery.

When and under what circumstances should MRI be obtained in the evaluation of knee pain. Most patients will improve after four to six weeks of conservative care; therefore, emergent MRI is typically not required. Even in patients with a suspected anterior cruciate ligament tear, there is no urgent need for MRI because surgery is usually performed after knee rehabilitation has started. The only situation in which urgent MRI is required is when a younger, athletic patient sustains a traumatic injury, is unable to straighten the leg, and has a suspected meniscal tear. In such cases, MRI can be helpful in identifying repairable meniscal tears, and surgery should be performed within a few months to optimize outcomes.

6 Aside from this indication, MRI should not be performed for at least four to six weeks after the onset of knee pain, and then only after conservative treatment has been ineffective. As discussed by Grover in this issue of American Family Physician, MRI can then be used as a confirmatory test before surgery in patients with suspected internal derangement based on historical and physical examination findings. In conclusion, primary care physicians have a critical role in establishing appropriate expectations in patients with knee pain. Evaluation must be based on a thorough history and physical examination, rather than relying on MRI. When used judiciously, knee MRI should decrease the number of surgical procedures performed, resulting in better patient outcomes and significantly decreased costs.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the multiple-ligament injured knee [^113NbbdT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detecting soft tissue, neurovascular, and bony injury after multiple ligament knee injury, including knee dislocation.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective search was performed for patients presenting with reported knee dislocation from May 1993 through May 2000 who underwent both MRI and surgical reconstruction. Twenty-one patients met these criteria (15 men and six women; age range 14 to 75 years; mean 32.6 years). Magnetic resonance diagnoses of soft tissue and bony injury were compared with the patients' operative findings. MRA of the popliteal vessels was performed in seventeen of our twenty-one patients, and the results of these studies are described.

Results

Multiple ligamentous, tendinous, meniscal, chondral, osseous, and neural injuries were seen. There was excellent correlation (kappa > 0.8) between the magnetic resonance and operative findings with regard to the size and location of tears. Regarding meniscal tears, the type (e.g., bucket, radial split, meniscocapsular separation) and location correlated well with surgery. All ten nerve injuries noted on magnetic resonance were confirmed at surgery. Six of our patients had both conventional angiograms and MRAs with 100 percent agreement between the studies. In one patient an intimal flap in the popliteal artery was seen on MRA and confirmed on conventional angiographic images.

Conclusion

MRI is an accurate method of assessing soft tissue, osseous, and neural damage after knee dislocation. Our early experience with popliteal fossa MRA is encouraging with complete agreement between the MRA and conventional angiography in patients who had both studies.

Background

No standardized methodology and objective criteria currently exist to accurately and objectively assess tunnel placement and consequent graft orientation in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) through a single imaging modality. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology have enabled the use of volumetric high spatial and contrast resolution proton density-weighted sequencing, which allows precise delineation of graft orientation, tunnel position, and quantitative assessment of tunnel position relationship to adjacent reproducible anatomic landmarks.

Purpose

To establish an MRI protocol that would provide an accurate alternative to 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) for standardized assessment of bone tunnel placement in ACLR, as a component of assessing ACLR outcomes and to assist in presurgical planning for revision ACLR.

Study Design

Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Twenty-four participants diagnosed with a failed ACLR underwent MRI and 3D-CT per the imaging protocols of the Sydney Orthopaedic Research Institute, in which the acquired data were converted to 3D models. The bone tunnels of the previous ACLR were then intraoperatively digitized at the tunnel aperture and along the length of the tunnel (barrel) and used as the reference standard to evaluate the accuracy of high-resolution MRI and 3D-CT. Differences in geometry between the image-based model and the reference point cloud were calculated through point-to-point comparison.

Results

At the tunnel apertures, no significant differences were detected between the MRI and 3D-CT models versus the reference models for the femur (P = .9472) and tibia (P = .5779). Mean ± SD tunnel barrel deviations between MRI and 3D-CT were 0.48 ± 0.28 mm (femur) and 0.46 ± 0.27 mm (tibia). No significant differences were detected between the MRI and 3D-CT models versus the reference models for the femoral (P = .5730) and tibial (P = .3002) tunnel barrels.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that, in addition to being the optimum modality for assessment of soft tissue injury of the knee, a high-resolution 3D turbo spin echo proton density sequence can provide an accurate assessment of tunnel placement, without the use of ionizing radiation. Therefore, this protocol provides the foundation for an objective standardized platform to quantitatively evaluate the location of ACL bone tunnels and graft orientation for routine postoperative assessment, presurgical planning, and evaluation of clinical outcomes.

### A biomechanical approach to interpreting magnetic resonance imaging of knee injuries [^115NGvzh]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article discusses common injury mechanisms and the subsequent constellation of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in the knee following trauma in the context of instability, as distinguished by the degree of knee flexion and tibial rotation at the time of initial injury, in addition to the direction and magnitude of the responsible force vectors. Using 3-dimensional imaging, common injury mechanisms are illustrated and correlated with MR imaging findings of the resulting osteochondral, ligamentous, meniscal, and musculotendinous lesions. The most common classification and grading systems for these individual lesions and their subsequent treatment implications are discussed.

### Contrast-enhanced MRI findings of the knee in healthy children; establishing normal values [^112L64TZ]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define normative standards for the knee in healthy children using contrast-enhanced MRI, focusing on normal synovial membrane thickness. Secondly, presence of joint fluid and bone marrow oedema was evaluated.

Methods

For this study, children without disorders potentially resulting in (accompanying) arthritis were included. Patients underwent clinical assessments, followed by contrast-enhanced MRI. MRI features were evaluated in consensus using the Juvenile Arthritis MRI Scoring (JAMRIS) system. Additionally, the presence of joint fluid was evaluated. No cartilage lesions or bone abnormalities were observed.

Results

We included 57 healthy children. The overall mean thickness of the normal synovial membrane was 0.4 mm (min-max; 0.0–1.8mm). The synovium was thickest around the cruciate ligaments and retropatellar and suprapatellar regions. The mean overall diameter of the largest pocket of joint fluid was 2.8 mm (min-max; 0.9–8.0mm). Bone marrow changes were observed in three children (all in the apex patellae).

Conclusions

The normal synovial membrane was maximally 1.8 mm thick, indicating that the JAMRIS cut-off value of 2 mm can be considered a valid measure for evaluating synovial hypertrophy. Some joint fluid and bone marrow changes suggestive of bone marrow oedema in the apex patellae can be seen in healthy children.

Key Points

- Knowledge on the normal synovial appearance using contrast-enhanced MR is lacking.
- In healthy children, normal synovial membrane is maximally 1.8 mm thick.
- Normal synovium is thickest around the cruciate ligaments, retropatellar and suprapatellar.
- Bone marrow oedema in the apex patellae is seen in healthy children.

### 3T MRI of the knee with optimised isotropic 3D sequences: accurate delineation of intra-articular pathology without prolonged acquisition times [^116PJL8e]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate optimised isotropic 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) and gradient echo (GRE)-based pulse sequences for visualisation of articular cartilage lesions within the knee joint.

Methods

Optimisation of experimental imaging sequences was completed using healthy volunteers (n = 16) with a 3-Tesla (3T) MRI scanner. Imaging of patients with knee cartilage abnormalities (n = 57) was then performed. Acquired sequences included 3D proton density-weighted (PDW) TSE (SPACE) with and without fat-suppression (FS), and T2✱W GRE (TrueFISP) sequences, with acquisition times of 6:51, 6:32 and 5:35 min, respectively.

Results

One hundred sixty-one confirmed cartilage lesions were detected and categorised (Grade II n = 90, Grade III n = 71). The highest sensitivity and specificity for detecting cartilage lesions were obtained with TrueFISP with values of 84.7% and 92%, respectively. Cartilage SNR mean for PDW SPACE-FS was the highest at 72.2. TrueFISP attained the highest CNR means for joint fluid/cartilage (101.5) and joint fluid/ligament (156.5), and the lowest CNR for cartilage/meniscus (48.5). Significant differences were identified across the three sequences for all anatomical structures with respect to SNR and CNR findings (p-value < 0.05).

Conclusion

Isotropic TrueFISP at 3T, optimised for acquisition time, accurately detects cartilage defects, although it demonstrated the lowest contrast between cartilage and meniscus.

Key Points

- Cartilage is better visualised with 3D TrueFISP than 3D SPACE sequences.
- 3D TrueFISP is a reliable sequence for detecting low- and high-grade cartilage defects.
- 3D TrueFISP at 3T provides excellent contrast between cartilage and joint fluid.

### Magnetic resonance imaging provides additional utility in the preoperative cartilage assessment of patients undergoing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty [^116t1Mrs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The selection of patients with correct indications is important to optimise the success and longevity of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Accepted surgical indications for medial UKA are anteromedial bone‐on‐bone osteoarthritis (OA), full‐thickness cartilage in the lateral compartment and functionally intact medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL). Additionally, and particularly for the Oxford UKA, evidence of patellofemoral (PF) OA may not be considered a contraindication if the PF joint does not have full‐thickness cartilage loss within the lateral facet or trochlea, with any eburnation, grooving or subluxation.

The traditional gold standard for assessing these features is with preoperative anteroposterior and mediolateral radiographs, which provide reliable sensitivity and specificity for experienced UKA surgeons. More recently, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide higher accuracy in the assessment of the joint has become commonplace. The high tissue contrast obtained with MRI provides improved resolution to delineate partial‐thickness cartilage defects and ACL or MCL deficiencies, compared with standard radiographs. Specifically for medial UKA, MRI is useful for checking the integrity of the lateral and PF compartments and the ACL. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to detect additional structural abnormalities not visible on radiographs, such as subchondral bone marrow oedema (BME) but may have the potential to affect clinical outcomes.

Although MRI can provide additional resolution compared to radiographs alone, some have suggested that it may be too sensitive for preoperative assessment of UKA patients. This could adversely lead to unnecessary costs or over‐utilisation of total knee arthroplasty for patients who would otherwise have good clinical outcomes with UKA. There is a need to better understand the perceived benefits and need of MRI for UKA patient assessment. There is currently no consensus on the most appropriate classification system of cartilage damage severity using MRI. The International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) classification, initially developed for use in arthroscopy, is considered easily transferrable for MRI evaluation. The ICRS MRI lesion classification is used here to evaluate the utility of MRI for preoperative assessment of medial UKA patients. The main aim of this study was to assess the benefits offered by MRI for preoperative cartilage assessment of UKA patients compared with standard radiographs by (1) comparing OA severity of the medial, lateral and PF compartments when assessed using MRI compared with standard radiographs, and (2) investigating associations of these two assessments with postoperative clinical outcomes.

### Development of a multi-task deep learning system for classification of nine common knee abnormalities on MRI: a large-scale, multicentre, stepwise validation study [^114s4FXa]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Through structured radiologist interviews and extensive case review, we identified scenarios where the DLS provided significant support in minimizing overdiagnosis or missed detections for nine abnormalities. The first challenge is diagnosing meniscal tear alongside ACL tear (Fig. 5 A). Trauma-induced hemarthrosis complicates visualization due to the paramagnetic properties of blood and hemoglobin degradation, with residual ACL fibers and synovitis further mimicking meniscal tears, leading to false positives. The second challenge involves early detection of cartilage defect (Fig. 5 B), particularly when confined to the superficial cartilage layer. Joint effusion and indistinct lesion boundaries can obscure early cartilage changes. The third challenge concerns partial ACL tear, which overlap with mucoid degeneration of the ACL on PDwFS images (Fig. 5 C). Additionally, while ACL is typically evaluated in the sagittal plane, this orientation may not always provide parallel alignment, leading to misinterpretation from partial volume effects. The fourth challenge is chronic PCL injury (Fig. 5 D), which can appear as a continuous ligament with near-normal signal intensity, making it easy to overlook. Additionally, a normal PCL in its relaxed state often appears tortuous with increased PDwFS signal, leading to potential overdiagnosis. The fifth difficulty lies in diagnosing MCL injury in the presence of medial compartment pathologies (Fig. 5 E), such as meniscal tear or osteoarthritis, where reactive fluid may cause an MCL bulge, leading to overdiagnosis. The sixth challenge pertains to LCL injury due to complex adjacent structures (Fig. 5 F). Variability in these structures, such as the popliteofibular ligament, arcuate ligament, and fabellofibular ligament, adds to the diagnostic difficulty. The seventh challenge involves IFP injury (Fig. 5 G), where effusion extending along the gap between the IFP and infrapatellar plica can be misdiagnosed as edema. The eighth issue concerns lateral synovial plica (Fig. 5 H), which are deep and often obscured by nearby structures like the lateral meniscus, LCL, and synovium. The ninth challenge is differentiating cystic structures (e.g. popliteal or synovial cyst) from effusions in knee recesses due to their anatomical overlap (Fig. 5 I). In conclusion, the DLS's ability to address diagnostic challenges enables radiologists to make more reliable decisions, boosting their confidence and supporting ongoing medical development.

### MR imaging of meniscal and cruciate ligament injuries [^111q3a2r]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

MR imaging provides clinically useful information in detecting and characterizing sports-related pathology of the menisci and cruciate ligaments in a noninvasive fashion. Meniscal tears can also be detected and characterized with regard to extent and tear stability with MR imaging. Acute and chronic tears of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments can be accurately identified and evaluated with MR imaging.

### Editorial commentary: magnetic resonance imaging of the knee anterolateral ligament: does It really matter? [^117ENArK]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Great interest remains in the structures of the knee anterolateral complex and how they work synergistically with the anterior cruciate ligament to control anterolateral rotatory laxity. Many studies have now used magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree of damage to the anterolateral ligament. The systematic review described in this commentary rigorously highlights the many deficiencies that exist within our current understanding of the imaging analysis of these structures. Marked variability in the definition of anterolateral ligament injury, significant methodological differences, and the lack of a gold standard reference make it very challenging to translate the findings of these imaging studies into clinical practice. More information is required to fully understand the injury pattern, and then clinical studies are needed to guide treatment. Hopefully we will then have the ability to better treat our patients with these challenging complex laxity patterns that exist over and above an isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury.

### New-generation 0.55 T MRI of the knee-initial clinical experience and comparison with 3 T MRI [^112Xa94M]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Internal derangement of the knee is one of the most common indications for MRI of the musculoskeletal system, and consequently, the knee is a commonly imaged joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the imaging standard, due to the superior soft tissue contrast when compared with other imaging modalities. Although both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI can provide diagnostic images, 3 T MRI is generally preferred at most institutions, providing higher image resolution. This is in keeping with a contemporary meta-analysis, suggesting benefits of 3 T over 1.5 T knee MRI. Moreover, increasing literature is published regarding the potential of ultra-high field 7 T MRI of the knee, possibly offering superior assessment of joint cartilage. Perhaps contradicting this trend of greater field strength knee MRI for ever more detailed analyses, we hypothesized that new-generation low-field MRI allows for diagnostic knee examinations in clinical practice and is able to answer common referrer queries. These include the identification of trauma sequelae of the ligaments, tendons, menisci, bone, and joint cartilage. Thus, the purpose of our study was to compare the detection rate of and reader confidence in new-generation 0.55 T knee MRI findings with 3 T knee MRI in patients with knee pain after acute trauma.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences? [^114HLF3A]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another imaging technique proven valuable for the detection of synovitis and enthesitis is ultrasound. The advantages of US over MRI are lower costs, short examination time, easy accessibility, and the ability to depict soft tissue inflammation without the use of contrast agents, even though contrast media might further improve the evaluation of subclinical synovitis. However, ultrasound US has limited reproducibility since no standardized imaging or reporting protocols exist. Deep joint spaces cannot be assessed due to acoustic shadowing from overlying bones and this method is limited in large or obese children. Cruciate ligament synovial involvement, a structure of deep joint space, has been shown to be specific for JIA and improves discrimination between JIA and unaffected children. This discrimination is possible only with MRI but not with US, rendering MRI an indispensable diagnostic tool in JIA. Another great advantage is the possibility to examine the entire joint.

Our study has limitations. Not all MRI examinations of the knee were conducted with a dedicated knee coil. In patients in need of an MRI of both knees, this examination was carried out in some patients in one single examination using a multi-channel body matrix. However, the use of surface coils for MR imaging of the knee might be nonetheless sufficient under certain circumstances and can produce images of acceptable quality. Due to the small number of knee examinations acquired using a dedicated knee coil in our study, no clear conclusion can be drawn and further investigation is needed. We used the Youden index to calculate specificity and sensitivity. Since the cutoff point is determined via statistical analysis and disregards clinical factors, the specificity was higher than the sensitivity.

Another limitation is the small number of patients involved as this was a single-center study with a retrospective study design. In addition, for most patients, no follow-up MRI was available to evaluate and correlate with clinical therapy response. However, this is the first study to show unenhanced MR images acquired on a 3T MRI to detect synovial thickening of the knee joint as reliably as on enhanced MR images.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116sDPhb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Investigations

Laboratory tests are almost never necessary in evaluating a patient with anterior knee pain. CBC, ESR or CRP, blood and joint cultures should be done if infection is suspected. Arthritis is a clinical diagnosis; ANA, rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 are helpful in classification and treatment but not diagnosis.

Imaging

Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most common imaging tools used to assess the pediatric knee. As with all tests, false positive and false negative results may occur and clinical correlation is necessary.

Radiographs

Routine radiographs of the knee include weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. The AP view allows evaluation of the distal femoral physis, proximal tibial physis, tibial intercondylar eminence, and patella. The lateral view allows evaluation of the position of the patella and tibial tubercle. Axial (skyline patellar profile) and tunnel (notch) views are part of the traditional orthopedic evaluation. The axial view is tangential to the anterior aspect of the flexed knee (usually 30 to 45 degrees of knee flexion) allowing evaluation of the congruity of the patellofemoral articulation and a measure of patellar tilt. The tunnel (notch) view, most commonly used in pediatrics to diagnose osteochondritis dissecans, is an AP radiograph with the knee flexed to 20 degrees to allow evaluation of the articular surfaces of the distal femoral condyles.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

MRI is a powerful tool in diagnosing knee disorders. In the absence of established guidelines, it is commonly misused as a screening examination. MRI images are obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal planes. MRI allows evaluation of the soft tissues including the muscles, tendons, menisci, cruciate and collateral ligaments, retinaculum, neurovascular bundle, bursa and synovium. MRI also allows a more detailed evaluation of osseous structures including articular and physeal cartilage, subchondral bone, periosteum, and bone marrow elements. Intravenous injection of gadolinium is not routine but is useful to delineate synovial enhancement.

MRI should be done only after a thorough clinical examination and standard radiographs are unable to provide a specific diagnosis. Ideally it should be ordered by a physician capable of interpreting the images and providing definitive treatment.
