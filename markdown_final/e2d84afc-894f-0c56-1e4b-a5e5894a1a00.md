## Question

Key components to creating an educational toolkit for adults with IDD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key components to creating an educational toolkit for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that underpin effective, equitable education for adults with IDD. Then, I should verify the core content domains that must be covered. Next, I will examine accessibility and universal design features. After that, I need to consider delivery formats and implementation logistics. I will then review evaluation and quality assurance, followed by stakeholder engagement and coproduction. Finally, I should address transition and life-course considerations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles, because if I get these wrong, everything downstream will falter. Person-centeredness, autonomy, and least-restrictive supports are essential, and I should explicitly align with DSM-5's emphasis on adaptive functioning across conceptual, social, and practical domains rather than IQ thresholds, while also honoring supported decision-making and human rights frameworks that prioritize dignity and self-determination [^79fcdfdb] [^679b83c6] [^10bfddcc]. I need to ensure the toolkit is trauma-informed and culturally responsive, given the cumulative impact of stigma and systemic barriers across the life course, and I should double-check that these principles are woven into both content and process rather than treated as add-ons [^73b706ea] [^e5267cac].

> Next, I should review the core content domains that adults with IDD consistently need. Health literacy and self-management are foundational, including medication understanding, preventive care, and chronic disease management, with evidence that structured, supported programs can be feasible and impactful when adapted to cognitive and social realities [^36ac4d5c] [^9bed24a9]. Sexual and reproductive health education must be comprehensive, nonjudgmental, and accessible, recognizing that many adults with IDD are sexually active yet underserved by standard curricula [^899162c1]. I should also include mental health and behavioral health literacy, with attention to diagnostic overshadowing and functional assessment approaches that match developmental level rather than chronological age [^ffe6ab85] [^b171f8d9]. Daily living and independence skills, communication and social participation, and legal rights and decision-making supports round out the essential domains, and I need to ensure each is scaffolded to build capacity over time [^a963efbe] [^679b83c6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about format without addressing accessibility and universal design. I should confirm that materials follow plain language principles, use multimodal formats, and incorporate visual supports and pictorial consent processes, drawing on validated tools for extreme low literacy and disability-informed design [^62a2f330]. I need to check that cognitive load is managed by chunking content, repeating key points, and providing concrete examples, and I should ensure accommodations are built in rather than retrofitted, including alternative formats and assistive technology compatibility [^899162c1] [^5c0e097a]. But wait, what if the user has limited digital access or prefers analog tools? I should plan for both digital and print options and test comprehension and usability with the target audience before finalizing [^notfound].

> I will now examine delivery formats and implementation logistics, and I need to ensure flexibility and feasibility. Individualized, one-to-one or small-group formats often improve engagement and generalization, and I should consider embedding education within existing routines and natural environments to support transfer of learning, as shown in developmental and sequenced interventions and supported self-management models [^31c1ca5f] [^9bed24a9]. Let me verify that supporter involvement is structured and explicit, with clear roles for caregivers, direct support professionals, and peers, and I should confirm that training for facilitators includes communication strategies, trauma-informed care, and disability-specific pedagogies to maintain fidelity and quality [^d3d3b4ab] [^daef1a47]. I should also consider hybrid models that blend in-person and asynchronous components to accommodate varying schedules and support needs [^notfound].

> Next, I should review evaluation and quality assurance, and I need to ensure metrics are aligned with real-world outcomes. Pre/post assessments of knowledge, skills, and confidence are necessary but insufficient; I should also track behavior change, health outcomes, and participation gains, and I must adapt transition readiness tools to IDD-specific capacities rather than assuming neurotypical milestones [^9bb0d6dc]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overpromising on psychometrics; feasibility and acceptability data from pilot work, along with structured fidelity checks and iterative quality improvement cycles, will strengthen claims while we build stronger outcome evidence [^36ac4d5c] [^aef896a0].

> I should confirm that stakeholder engagement and coproduction are not afterthoughts but integral to design, development, and dissemination. People with IDD must be paid co-creators who shape content, format, and delivery, and clinicians, caregivers, and community organizations should be engaged early to ensure relevance and uptake; coproduced toolkits show higher perceived value and real-world impact [^f8fbcad9]. Hold on, I should verify that feedback loops are built into governance, with advisory boards that include people with IDD and mechanisms to iterate based on user input and changing needs [^f8fbcad9].

> Let me consider transition and life-course integration, because adults with IDD often face abrupt shifts in systems of care and supports. I need to ensure the toolkit addresses healthcare transition, legal and financial planning, and evolving decision-making supports, ideally starting in adolescence with least-restrictive alternatives and aligning with Six Core Elements frameworks adapted for IDD [^e6794f47] [^36524d9f]. I should double-check that content is staged across the life course, with modules that can be revisited as goals, capacities, and environments change, and I must incorporate supported decision-making agreements and accessible advance planning tools [^679b83c6] [^e47be00a].

> Finally, I will synthesize the key components succinctly while preserving the evidentiary anchors. The toolkit must be grounded in person-centered, trauma-informed, culturally responsive principles; cover health literacy, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, daily living and communication, and legal rights; embody universal design with plain language, multimodal formats, and built-in accommodations; offer flexible, individualized delivery with trained facilitators and explicit supporter roles; include robust, IDD-aligned evaluation and iterative quality improvement; be coproduced with people with IDD and key stakeholders; and integrate transition and life-course planning to support autonomy across settings [^79fcdfdb] [^899162c1] [^62a2f330] [^31c1ca5f] [^f8fbcad9] [^e6794f47]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis aligns with both the evidence base and the lived experience priorities articulated in recent consensus statements and community-led agendas, which it does, while acknowledging that ongoing research and evaluation are needed to strengthen the evidence base and refine implementation [^10bfddcc].

### Sexual health education for adolescents and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities: recommendations for accessible sexual and reproductive health information [^899162c1]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Sexual and reproductive health is an important aspect of human development, but discussions with adolescents and young adults on this topic are often challenging for health-care providers. As a result, many adolescents and young adults do not receive appropriate, comprehensive sexual education, despite recognition from WHO and the UN that access to this education is a human right. Adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate intellectual or developmental disability, or both, are just as likely to be sexually active as are their peers without disability; however, these individuals are less likely to receive comprehensive sexual education. To ensure adequate comprehensive sexual education for adolescents and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, sexual health educators should facilitate conversations about sexual and reproductive health that are non-judgmental and sexually inclusive. Such initiatives should use an educational framework grounded in universal design for learning, including use of multiple media types with clear, concise language and images.

### About whom are we talking when we use intellectual and developmental disabilities? [^87a97d35]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Communicating clearly about who is included in a population group is a critical element to effective dissemination and knowledge transfer. This narrative review highlights the inconsistency as it relates to communicating about individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and developmental disability (DD).

Observations

There is enormous variability in the use of definitions and abbreviations in the field of intellectual disability and developmental disabilities. The lack of consistency has resulted in widely varying reported rates of prevalence and has contributed to confusion around the interpretation of research and clinical findings, population statistics, and policy decisions. The reported rates of prevalence for developmental disabilities published by different US federal agencies have ranged widely from 3% to 17%. This represents a 5-fold difference. Equally confusing is the inconsistent and ambiguous adoption of initialisms. These initialisms include ID/DD, IDD, and I/DD for which it is not always clear if these initialisms reference separate and independent populations (eg, ID or DD) or populations with co-occurring conditions (eg, persons with ID and DD). This Narrative Review discusses these issues and proposed a number of recommendations that would contribute to enhanced consistency and clarity of understanding for stakeholders, administrators, practitioners, researchers, and policy makers.

Conclusion

Authors of scholarly works, clinical publications, policies, and position papers are encouraged to provide a clear operational definition as well as the choice of initialisms used (eg, ID/DD, IDD, I/DD, etc) when it is first used.

### Oral health status of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in India: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^53e0f4b3]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings serve as a call to action for healthcare practitioners, legislators, and caregivers to include oral health in treatment programmes for children with IDD. Given the current state of oral health among children with IDD, numerous initiatives, such as educational components for caregivers as well as dental professional training on how to manage oral health in this population should be established. Parents or caregivers of IDD children must be aided in managing their children's dental health through food warnings, information about accessible toolkits, dental telemedicine services, specific professionals and trauma prevention. Furthermore, oral health should be included in the overall healthcare plan for children with IDD. This could include routine dental check-ups beginning at the age of one year, as well as the incorporation of oral health instruction within special education curricula for healthcare personnels. The government should encourage dental biomedical enterprises to actively participate in enhancing products and technologies for IDD children.

### "All doctors should be trained in that": the coproduction and mixed-methods evaluation of an educational toolkit to enable safe, high-quality genetic health care for people with intellectual disability [^f8fbcad9]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

People with intellectual disability inequitably access high-quality genetic health care. However, they are keen to understand genetic health care and recommend that clinicians need education on delivering more inclusive care and that multimodal genetic health literacy resources should be coproduced.

Methods

Our inclusive research team applied best-practice coproduction principles to deliver a suite of resources, the GeneEQUAL Toolkit. Mixed-methods evaluation, including surveys and focus group/interviews, assessed (1) clinicians' perceived capabilities, motivation, and opportunities for providing inclusive health care for people with intellectual disability before and after exploring the Toolkit; (2) the perceptions and opinions of people with intellectual disability about the Toolkit; (3) the reach of the Toolkit components; and (4) the reflections of people with intellectual disability and clinicians on the coproduction process.

Results

The Toolkit met the expectations and preferences of people with intellectual disability and clinicians, and had a global reach. Coproduction was feasible and judged as critical for the high value of the Toolkit, in motivating clinicians to change their clinical practice and empowering people with intellectual disability.

Conclusion

Coproduction can be successfully applied to improve the engagement of people with intellectual disability, potentially reducing health inequity and improving the safety and quality of genetic health care.

### Advancing health policy and outcomes for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities: a community-led agenda [^10bfddcc]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Importance

At least 10 million people in the United States have an intellectual and/or developmental disability (IDD). People with IDD experience considerably higher rates of poor overall health, chronic conditions including diabetes, mental health challenges, maternal mortality, and preventable deaths. This Special Communication proposes national goals based on a community-led consensus model that advances priority health outcomes for people with IDD and their caregivers/partners and identifies critical policy opportunities and challenges in achieving these goals. A community-led consensus agenda offers a foundation for focusing research, improving data collection and quality measurement, enhancing coverage and payment for services, and investing in a prepared clinical workforce and infrastructure in ways that align with lived experiences and perspectives of community members.

Observations

People with IDD prioritize holistic health outcomes and tailored supports and services, driven by personalized health goals, which shift over their life course. Caregivers/partners need support for their own well-being, and easy access to resources to optimize how they support loved ones with IDD. Development of an adequately prepared clinical workforce to serve people with IDD requires national and regional policy changes that incentivize and structure training and continuing education. Ensuring effective and high-value coverage, payment, and clinical decisions requires investments in new data repositories and data-sharing infrastructure, shared learning across public and private payers, and development of new technologies and tools to empower people with IDD to actively participate in their own health care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Consensus health priorities identified in this project and centered on IDD community members' perspectives are generalizable to many other patient populations. Public and private payers and regulators setting standards for health information technology have an opportunity to promote clinical data collection that focuses on individuals' needs, quality measurement that emphasizes person-centered goals rather than primarily clinical guidelines, and direct involvement of community members in the design of payment policies. Clinical education leaders, accrediting bodies, and investors/entrepreneurs have an opportunity to innovate a better prepared health care workforce and shared data infrastructure to support value-based care programs.

### Efficacy of healthy aging interventions for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities: a systematic review [^8bb573ec]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There is a lack of information on intervention strategies employed for health promotion and disease prevention for older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), who usually experience poorer health compared to their peers without IDDs. We carried out the first systematic review to scrutinize the impact of intrinsic factors (e.g., cognitive, mental, and physical health) on the health status of older adults with IDDs.

Research Design and Methods

To assess the efficacy of such interventions, we examined 23 articles including prospective "healthy aging" interventions designed for adults with IDDs. Searches were carried out in the databases Web of Science, Scielo, and PsycINFO in April 2020. Articles were organized in thematic areas: (a) physical activity and health nutrition (n = 10), (b) health education and health screening (n = 6), (c) social inclusion and community participation (n = 3), and (d) multicomponents (n = 4). Except for 5 randomized controlled trial studies, the designs were mainly nonrandomized, involving small sample sizes (Nrange = 8–379 participants), and lacking follow-up.

Results

The studies included 2,398 men and women with IDDs (ranging in age from 18 to 86 years [mean age: 44.3 years]). Overall, intervention outcomes were mostly positive; however, some negative outcomes were reported.

Discussion and Implications

In brief, healthy aging interventions for people with IDDs remain scarce, incipient, and sporadic. We recommend that more attention needs to be given to active health promotion with people with IDDs as a program practice among organizations and as a focal public policy among governments.

### Strategies for addressing the needs of children with or at risk of developmental disabilities in early childhood by 2030: a systematic umbrella review [^f4429450]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In this context, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to achieve universal health coverage, reduce poverty and promote social inclusion, amongst other goals by 2030. SDG 4 is dedicated to early childhood development and care; specifically, Target 4.2 calls for actions to facilitate school readiness for children with disabilities towards inclusive education. These goals require the identification of children with or at risk of developmental disabilities in the first 5 years of age and the provision of services to address their needs before school entry. However, despite the growing number of children with developmental disabilities, global funding schemes for early childhood development do not adequately address the challenges faced by these children and their families.

While services for children with and at risk of developmental disabilities (encompassing prevention, identification and rehabilitation interventions) are often perceived as highly specialised and costly, it is crucial to understand and provide evidence for comprehensive support that may not be so. For instance, evidence-based developmental screening tools integrated into regular early childhood check-ups can streamline identification of potential challenges early on, leveraging existing healthcare infrastructure. This integration eliminates the need for extra appointments, ensuring timely support and contributing to intervention sustainability by utilising the existing network of healthcare professionals, making essential care accessible to a wider population and broadening their impact. Access to care and support should begin with ensuring that routine child health services and education are inclusive of children with disabilities. By embedding inclusivity at this foundational level, we pave the way for a more equitable and supportive environment that can foster better developmental outcomes.

Consequently, amidst this drive for equitable access and comprehensive support, there is a growing interest in early identification of developmental disabilities, spurred by a global commitment to equity and inclusive education. However, this poses practical and ethical challenges when suitable services are not available for identified children, particularly in LMIC. The goal of early identification is universal, and some methods and tools used in high-income countries can be beneficial without requiring significant adaptation, depending on the specific disabilities. For example, corrective glasses may not need adaptation to be prescribed in all populations. It is therefore essential to consider contextual differences and carefully assess how evidence-based interventions can be adapted and effectively implemented in various settings to ensure their relevance and effectiveness for the target population. Stigma, discrimination and exclusion further emphasise the need for a transformative approach to early care and support, because they perpetuate societal inequalities, hinder access to essential services and reinforce barriers that impede the holistic development and well-being of children with developmental disabilities.

### Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities [^bbc49f8f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of individuals with I/DD from the priority guidelines stems, in part, from a continued inattention to this population in research studies. Specifically, national population health data for individuals with I/DD is incomplete and strategies to improve vaccination rates in individuals with I/DD are under-explored. Additionally, the vast majority of research has not been informed by the perspectives, experiences, and priorities of individuals with I/DD and their families. These research gaps are particularly critical to fill during the pandemic in order to identify strategies to increase vaccination rates and understand host immunological responses to vaccinations for this population.

We propose the following to address the pressing needs of the I/DD community during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, all individuals with I/DDs should be prioritized for vaccinations. This requires a broadening of current Phase 1 prioritizations. Of course, merely amending the guidelines will not be sufficient to address the health disparities, exacerbated by COVID-19, that individuals with I/DDs face. Thus, there is a concomitant need to develop a public-health infrastructure that will promote access to vaccinations. These investments should support awareness and education regarding vaccination availability and protocols to ensure that individuals with I/DD are able to benefit from the priority guidelines. As an example, ACIP should provide clear guidance to individuals and families on their website and all public materials. Further, I/DD populations should expressly be integrated into state vaccination guidelines. State guidelines should consistently include those in group homes or other institutions, as well as their direct support professionals, and make procedures understandable and easy to navigate. Finally, researchers and funders should prioritize studies that will promote the health and well-being of individuals with I/DDs during the pandemic. We urge the new Biden administration and community of policymakers to accept these recommendations and commit to a social-justice oriented agenda that will ameliorate health disparities for individuals with I/DDs.

### Development and implementation of a continuing care program for patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities in family medicine [^fd27ec16]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

In the United States, individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) consistently experience health disparities. One factor is limited access to quality healthcare services equipped to meet the needs of those with IDD, particularly as they transition to adulthood. The purpose of this work is to describe the development and implementation of Jefferson's Continuing Care Program (JCCP), which was designed to address this care gap. We share how the idea, logistics, and support for the clinic were developed; how JCCP was designed to be uniquely accessible both via physical space and clinic flow; and how those challenges encountered have been crucial for fine-tuning optimal patient care. Since its inception in 2019, JCCP has made large strides towards educating the next generation of medical providers to care for patients with IDD. Looking to the future, JCCP plans to broaden its impact by serving more patients, continuing our advocacy and education work, and continuing to adapt to the needs of our community.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^31c1ca5f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Narzisi and colleagues summarized the common components of these therapeutic programs that seem related to higher efficacy: starting as early as possible, which includes both early diagnosis and minimizing delays from diagnosis to treatment; being intensive; involving family; providing regular assessments to update treatment goals; providing supervision; encouraging spontaneous communication; supporting positive behaviors rather than tackling challenging behaviors; promoting skills via play with peers; and completing the acquisition, subsequent generalization and maintenance of new skills in natural contexts. These last two components are easier to achieve by including children into schools. Despite these recent advances, many challenges remain, and the condition of individuals with ASD is still a severe burden.

Intellectual disability (ID) is frequently comorbid with ASD, although the exact rate depends on the specific subpopulation (e.g.). For example, when patients with both ASD and epilepsy are recruited, up to 25–45% of cases have ID. ID is also a poor prognostic factor for long-term outcomes of ASD. Very few intervention models to date have specifically addressed the comorbidity of ID with ASD, in particular when ID is moderate to severe. In addition, most clinical studies exploring treatment efficacy have excluded children with very low Intellectual Quotient (IQ) and/or associated disorders. Peters-Scheffer et al. showed larger improvement on developmental age and adaptive skills in children with ASD and ID who received 2-years of low intensity behavioral treatment (LIBT) supplementing preschool services, compared to treatment as usual. Two randomized controlled trials compared 3-months of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) versus structured ABA in a school intervention setting for children with ASD and mild to moderate ID. They showed significant gains in social communication skills and significantly lower levels of disruptive behavior for PRT condition. PRT was also assessed for children with ASD and language delay: first, Minjarez and al showed that parents can learn PRT in group therapy, resulting in correlated gains in children's language; second improvements in language and cognitive functioning are maintained 3 months after completion of a 12-week PRT parent education group. Finally, another study on minimally verbal children with autism showed that a brief, targeted intervention on joint attention and play (JASPER: Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement and Regulation intervention) can improve core deficits. However, there is globally a dearth in the literature about specific interventions targeting children with ASD and ID. Furthermore, providing access to education is very difficult for this population. Thus, focusing research efforts on this understudied population who traditionally have been excluded from intervention trials is warranted whether it regards care as well as education.

### Intelligence… moving beyond the lowest common denominator [^4f51542b]. The American Psychologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite a century of use in assessing children for predicting academic success, IQ theory and assessments largely overlook the intellectual repertoires of adolescents and adults that are not common, including declarative, procedural, and tacit knowledge. Such knowledge and skill repertoires are essential elements of adult intellectual life and livelihood. A proposal for considering a wider range of knowledge and skills in the definition and assessment of intelligence is offered, along with ideas for moving forward in both research and applications. When intelligence is considered beyond the lowest common denominator, it is clear that there are many important questions have yet to be answered about adolescent and adult intellectual development, maintenance, and decline, occupational performance, relations between intelligence and nonability traits, and the role of engagement in day-to-day intellectual functioning. The proposed focus is to reconsider what it means to be an intelligent adult beyond the IQ measures and to recognize that adults, on average, are far more "intelligent" than they have been considered to be by traditional IQ assessments developed over the last century.

### The individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA) for children with special educational needs [^c6e55830]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Infants, toddlers, and the IFSP — Part C scope and plan components are outlined as follows: "Although IDEA focuses most of its attention on children aged 3 years and older, part C was developed in 1986 for the promotion of EI for children with developmental disabilities from birth to 3 years of age". It is "intended to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities, minimize the need for special education, and maximize the individual's long-term potential for independent living", and emphasizes family and community involvement. "The inclusion of families as team members is critical in developing and implementing the IFSP. The IFSP is a written plan with several key components or statements", including "Service coordinator (ie, a professional responsible for program implementation)", "The child's present levels of development, in the following areas: physical (including vision, hearing, and health status), cognitive, communication, social or emotional, and adaptive", "Family's resources, priorities, and concerns related to enhancing the child's development", and "Measurable results or outcomes expected to be achieved by the child and family, with criteria, procedures, and timelines to be used".

### Improving the use of transition readiness measures in research and clinical care [^9bb0d6dc]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of transition readiness is considered a crucial component of effective transition. It is included as one of the Six Core Elements of Transition in national transitional care guidelines. However, the current measures of transition readiness have not been found to correlate with either current or future health outcomes for youth. In addition, there are challenges in measuring transition readiness in youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities, who may not be expected to achieve skills and knowledge that are considered essential for transition in typically developing youth. These concerns make it difficult to know how best to use transition readiness measures in research and clinical care. This article highlights the appeal of measuring transition readiness in clinical and research contexts, the current barriers that prevent us from fully achieving those benefits, and potential strategies for bridging the gap. IMPACT: Transition readiness measures were developed as an attempt to identify those patients who were ready to successfully navigate the transition from pediatric to adult health care. Thus far, the measures that have been developed do not appear to be related to health outcomes such as disease control or timely attendance of the first adult appointment in adult care. We provide suggestions for how to address the current concerns with the available transition readiness measures.

### Implementation of inclusive education for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in African countries: a scoping review [^82464003]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To advance understanding of practices that support inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in inclusive education classrooms in Africa by conducting a review of the extant literature. Methods: Five academic databases were searched supplemented by a hand search of key journals and references of included studies. Two authors independently screened studies via a reference manager (Covidence) which allowed for blinding. A third author was consulted in cases of conflict. Results: Thirty articles that provided empirical evidence of inclusive education implementation were included. Eight articles highlighted practices that support inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Using Bronfenbrenner's bioecological framework, findings revealed that inclusive education implementation is influenced by factors on the bio level, micro level, meso level, and macro level. Recommendations for promoting inclusive education implementation are provided. Conclusions: Inclusion goes beyond teachers and requires strong commitment of other stakeholders such as families and governments. To guarantee the smooth inclusion of children with special education needs and particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, a set of practices validated through rigorous research as supportive and unique and that can be universal to Africa is wise. Implications for rehabilitation A number of strategies were identified that can improve the classroom inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Development of policies that support such strategies could improve implementation. Inclusion goes beyond teachers. Rehabilitation professionals (i.e. occupational therapists) and educational professionals should partner to identify practical solutions to the challenges of creating inclusive environments for children with special education needs. Committing more resources and time towards the development and implementation of special education policies can advance the successful inclusion of children with special education needs.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^f9a961c1]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Special education prevalence and income disparities — As of the 2019–2020 school year, 7.3 million children in the United States ages 3 to 21 received special education services through IDEA, and this number constitutes 14% of the total number of all students receiving public education. People with disabilities have lower median annual household incomes: $46,900 for a U.S. household with a person with a disability compared with $74,400 for those without a person with a disability.

### Designing and testing an educational innovation [^f95d7584]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Technology provides an opportunity to develop innovations to improve the way we teach. Developing educational innovations must be approached in a methodical and thorough manner to identify the educational gap and validate the innovation's success in filling the gap. A successful educational innovation requires a stepwise approach that includes needs assessment, design of intervention, testing and analysis, evaluation of intervention, and determination of learning retention.

### Using the NIH toolbox in special populations: considerations for assessment of pediatric, geriatric, culturally diverse, non-english-speaking, and disabled individuals [^5c0e097a]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In order to develop health outcomes measures that are relevant and applicable to the general population, it is essential to consider the needs and requirements of special subgroups, such as the young, elderly, disabled, and people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, within that population.

Methods

The NIH Toolbox project convened several working groups to address assessment issues for the following subgroups: pediatric, geriatric, cultural, non-English-speaking, and disabled. Each group reviewed all NIH Toolbox instruments in their entirety.

Results

Each working group provided recommendations to the scientific study teams regarding instrument content, presentation, and administration. When feasible and appropriate, instruments and administration procedures have been modified in accordance with these recommendations.

Conclusion

Health outcome measurement can benefit from expert input regarding assessment considerations for special subgroups.

### Aligning health worker education and learning approaches with population health needs: WHO's family planning and comprehensive abortion care toolkit for the primary healthcare workforce [^afdbf4e6]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

WHO defines competencies as: '… the abilities of a person to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes in their performance of tasks in a given context. Competencies are durable, trainable and, through the expression of behaviours, measurable'. Competency-based education and learning focus on outcomes, emphasise the learner's ability to perform, promote greater learner centredness and link the health needs of the population to the competencies required of health workers providing FP and CAC. Competencies generally specify minimum standards and the conditions within which they should be applied. The competencies needed to provide FP and CAC are best embedded in a competency-based education and learning system with competency-based performance assessment.

In 2011, WHO published a guidance document, Sexual and reproductive health — Core competencies in primary care, defining the competencies that primary care providers need to safely deliver SRH services at community level and included FP and CAC. These competencies were designed to inform preservice education, management of SRH services, client care and to improve universal access to quality health services. In 2020, as part of formative efforts to update the guidance, an assessment of published literature on how the 2011 WHO SRH — Core competencies in primary care document had been used discovered that the framework presented some important gaps and was not widely adopted. From this process, it was determined that specific FP and CAC competencies for health workers in primary healthcare should be provided to facilitate ease of uptake in a variety of contexts, place greater emphasis on attitudes, behaviours and managing care in restrictive environments, increase focus on people in vulnerable settings, such as adolescents and people with disabilities, and include innovative tools to support integration and implementation of the competencies. The 2022 WHO Family Planning and Comprehensive Abortion Care Toolkit for the primary healthcare workforce or the FP and CAC Toolkit incorporates all these characteristics.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^b072775f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Recommendations for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) — pediatric practice guidance states: Preservation of human rights and human dignity for all youth is essential while promoting autonomy of patients, pediatricians should advocate for the least restrictive decision-making environment for their patients, pediatricians can promote and support the developing autonomy of all patients by actively engaging them in conversations about care decisions while accounting for the youth's intellectual or developmental ability to express preferences and understand decisions about different aspects of their care, and discussions about decision-making should be a part of the structured transition planning for youth with IDD and start between the ages of 12 and 14 years.

Second, the study results are salient in the current French context. Since the seventies, France has developed specialized institutions for children with ASD. Daycare hospitals and medico-social institutes provide various integrative care aiming to develop socio-communicative abilities through play activities in a developmental view of building social relationships. But they offer very few educational support. However, French authorities have enshrined in the legislation the right for disabled children to be included in mainstream schools. Thus, special settings have been developed in schools and French children are more and more included in school. However, many children with severe ASD and ID initially cannot be placed in mainstream or even special education classrooms, especially if significant behavioral problems are present. Meanwhile, French families are still advocating to have more children with ASD included in mainstream schools even if there is comorbid moderate-severe ID. Several agencies, in France and in other countries, have recommended conducting interventions in school-based settings. Research demonstrates that children with ASD benefit from being with their peers in a school setting, and a variety of interventions could be used in classrooms, yet there is a gap between this research and educational practice. The context of a preschool seems to provide opportunities to develop communication skills, and by offering children opportunities to enter into play groups, teachers can reinforce a nonverbal ASD child's requests. Intervention in schools may be more generalizable because students can use learned communication skills within a natural environment such as a classroom. Two objectives should be combined: improving core deficits and practicing social communication. To date, more research is needed to identify the most effective classroom interventions: the majority of studies examine behavioral interventions in school, and the literature on school-based interventions generally deals with the question of providing intervention in school. They do not explore which ingredients will allow children with severe disabilities to rise to a learner position and enter school effectively. DS1-EI is one approach to allow children with autism and severe ID to participate in school activities, while developing socio-communicative abilities simultaneously. Impossibility of inclusion in an external school was an inclusion criterion. Through this setting, children who had very low abilities and often severe behavioral disorders and who were thus initially receiving very few time of unstructured education were actually able to participate in structured school activities 10 h per week. DS1-EI may be integrated into daycare hospitals or special education institutes, used to prepare children to enter mainstream schools, or delivered within the school context.

ACSM Expert Consensus — focus on moving more in adults with physical or developmental disabilities emphasizes a "move more" approach over prescriptive dosing, stating that "The health benefits of physical activity are graded, and people who are completely inactive have the most to gain from small increases in their activity levels", and that transitioning from inactivity to "even low levels of activity could have major health benefits". Evidence for behavior-change approaches is cited: "A systematic review (1) of eight meta-analyses showed that targeted behavioral interventions increased physical activity behavior in adults with physical or intellectual disabilities", with "Average effect sizes ranged from 0.29 to 1.0".

### The individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA) for children with special educational needs [^120ad5ce]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) — using EI or school evaluations in clinical care: The diagnostic evaluation performed by the EI program or school for eligibility can be helpful because it offers a standardized assessment of a child's development or intellectual functioning, and for young children it involves motor, communication, social, behavioral, adaptive, and sensory (hearing, vision) skills. Optimally, EI programs and schools share evaluation results with health care providers with informed written parental consent, though programs and schools may require a specific parental request; when received, the health care provider can review and discuss results with the family.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^679b83c6]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Supported decision-making — terms, implementation, and reported effects: The ability to make decisions concerning one's health care forms a continuum ranging from fully autonomous to fully substituted decision-making, punctuated by levels of supported decision-making in between these two extremes, and balancing autonomy with appropriate supports is an important consideration. Supported decision-making may be considered as an alternative to guardianship for individuals who need assistance to make some decisions, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes the right to autonomy and stresses the importance of supported decision-making over substituted decision-making. In recent years, numerous states have enacted laws adopting supported decision-making and pediatricians can familiarize themselves with the legislation/laws in their respective states; individuals with a range of disabilities can make appropriate decisions if supports are in place. Implementation involves choosing the trusted support person(s) and creating an agreement with the support person(s) that identifies the decision-making domains where assistance is needed or desired and the supports that are desired; examples include attending medical appointments, explaining what the physician said during a visit, and talking through treatment options, with a written document that can be shared with health professionals and other care team members. Douglas and Bigby propose an evidence-based framework that includes 7 steps in the supported decision-making process. Individuals with IDD who use supported decision-making report increased confidence in themselves and their decision-making, improved decision-making skills, increased engagement with their community, and perceived more control of their lives, while barriers include the required time, effort, payment, training of practice team members, and resources in practice settings, as well as the need to educate.

### Identifying the key elements of an education package to up-skill multidisciplinary adult specialist palliative care teams caring for young adults with life-limiting conditions: an online Delphi study [^f4988dd2]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and data analysis

A Delphi process is a systematic, interactive method using a panel of experts answering questions in two or more rounds. Examples of the application of a Delphi process are available in a clinical setting, including priority setting projects for a trials methodology research agenda, research into adolescent chronic illnesses and transitional care for adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A modified online Delphi process, using an online survey tool (Survey Monkey:), was used to collate suggestions for the required elements of the education package and was undertaken in three rounds. An online Delphi process was chosen due to its usefulness in gaining views from a wide range of experts in the field, all able to participate equally in the process while avoiding the practical difficulties of other, more resource-intensive methods, such as face-to-face consensus meetings.

Round 1

As the research team did not have extensive experience in caring for young people with life-limiting conditions, it was not possible to generate a list of questions with items available for rating. Therefore, Round 1 was used to generate these items using open-ended questions. SPC professionals known to the authors, were invited to take part in Round 1 of the Delphi. An initial email was sent to potential participants with a URL link to the Delphi Survey. The survey remained open for 2 weeks (10 working days); a reminder was sent after five working days for non-responders. Once the survey had closed, responses were collated and downloaded.

Participants were asked to answer 12 open-ended questions; the first three questions were demographic and screening questions about their job role. The remaining nine questions asked for their experiences in the facilitators and barriers to good transition, how families can best be supported through the transition process, challenges for caring for young people with life-limiting conditions, the essential skills and knowledge required to care for young people by palliative care providers (all roles), the format an education package should be delivered in, how often professionals would need to repeat or need training updated, and who should deliver the educational package.

Responses to each question were coded and summarised. The Study Management Group refined and summarised the list further, grouping the responses into the following categories: job role; content of the education package; format of the education package; frequency of delivery of the education package; who should deliver the education package. The final list was then used to generate the items for Round 2. A total of 87 items were generated across the five categories.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^4dbef306]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

In France, children with ASD and ID can be treated within special education centers (called "medico-social institutes") and daycare hospitals where school activities represent a minimal part of daily activities. Rehabilitation take an important place and children spend a consequent amount of time receiving individual or group care dispensed by psychologists, speech or occupational therapists. This care often called "integrative care" is embedded within free play sessions with adults and peers, and educative socialized moments. This care organization lays on the idea that children with very low developmental levels have to build the basic social and communicational abilities, before being able to access formal instruction in a classroom. They are rarely included in mainstream classrooms and receive few formalized education.

However, these programs have not been well-studied, and the research that exists is mainly observational. The largest study included 152 French children with autism. They received a large panel of interventions, but these interventions were not described because the study focused on the developmental trajectories and the predictive factors of outcome. French authorities, following the pressure of family associations, asked professionals to increase evidence-based research of French therapeutic programs for children with ASD and to promote education, which is less intensive compared to that of other European countries.

Indeed, mainstreaming is historically well-developed in Italy and is now common in many other countries. However, while education is compulsory in France, adapted education for children with ASD is not well-developed in France or in some other countries. This is particularly the case for children with severe ID, for whom mainstreaming might be anyway very difficult. In France, they are generally placed in daycare hospitals and medico-social institutes with very few educational support. Thus, few children with a low level of cognitive functioning can access adapted education. Could an individualized educational program, given by trained professionals in a one-to-one format, be implemented in these institutions, even for children with very low IQ? Could it bridge the gap between institutional care and adapted education in mainstream schools? How might this foster cognitive, socio-communicative and relational progress?

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^fcb7bc45]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Disability awareness, training, accessibility, and diversity — Guideline 1 states that psychologists strive to learn about various disability paradigms and models and their implications for service provision, noting that legal definitions determine eligibility and parameters for services and benefits, and that the ADA defines disability as a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such impairment", with the clarification, "This holds even with the use of equipment designed to mitigate the disability", and that this definition is inclusive of episodic disabilities or chronic illnesses when these affect one or more major life activities. Models described include the moral model, which views disability as "an embodiment of evil, a punishment for a family member's or ancestor's transgression, a divine gift, a test of faith and opportunity to overcome a challenge", and scientific/medical traditions such as the biomedical model that "views disability as a medical problem that deviates from the norm" and the medical model described as "a linear sequence, that is, pathology to disease to disability", which "emphasizes finding a cure and relieving or eliminating symptoms caused by impairment". The guidance underscores practice implications, stating it is important for psychologists to understand the influence of their own and clients' paradigms for "establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship and weighing clinical decisions", to consider "compensatory applications of these interventions in individualized ways that support the specific client and their needs", and it highlights a primary weakness of the medical model as "its omission of social determinants of health", with many advocates arguing that it "devalues individuals as "patients".

### Developing the FEEDS toolkit of parent-delivered interventions for eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties in young children with neurodisability: findings from a Delphi survey and stakeholder consultation workshops [^f6b8a392]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

An iterative online Delphi survey and two stakeholder consultation workshops were undertaken.

Delphi survey

Participants

Invitations to participate were sent to respondents from the FEEDS national surveywho had expressed interest in subsequent research stages. This included: parents of children (aged up to 12 years) with neurodisability who experienced EDSD; and health professionals working with children and young people (aged 0–18 years) with neurodisability. Participants were recruited through a wide range of sources, including the National Health Service (NHS), professional and parent networks and schools. Full recruitment strategies are outlined elsewhere

Measure

The questionnaire listed interventions and outcomes identified in earlier stages of the FEEDS research programme, comprising updates of three systematic reviews, a mapping review, a national survey and focus groups. The questionnaire's structure and format was developed with reference to methodological recommendationsand previous experience of Delphi surveys. The questionnaire contained three sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) parent-delivered interventions for young children with neurodisability and EDSD; and (3) outcomes to measure improvement in EDSD.

Questions related to 25 interventions and 22 outcomes (tables 1 and 2). Respondents rated the importance of the interventions as part of a treatment package for EDSD, and the outcomes to measure (using a 9-point scale: 0–3 'not important', 4–6 'important but not essential', 7–9 'essential'). Respondents could tick 'unable to score'. The questionnaire was hosted on Qualtrics.

Table 1
Description of interventions presented in Delphi survey

Table 2
Description of outcomes presented in Delphi survey

Patient and public involvement

The questionnaire and information sheet were developed by the research team, which included parent co-investigators, in consultation with the Parent Advisory Group (PAG) and following focus groups with parents and health professionals.

Procedure

The same questionnaire was sent to parents and health professionals in two rounds. In round 1, respondents rated the importance of individual intervention categories, and outcomes. In round 2, respondents were shown bar charts of parent and health professionals' ratings from round 1 and then re-rated the importance of each intervention and outcome. No items were removed between rounds. Both survey rounds were open for 3 weeks with a week between the rounds for data analysis. Respondents and non-respondents from round 1 were invited to take part in round 2, to maximise participation. Round 2 respondents entered a prize draw to win one of five £100 vouchers for each stakeholder group.

### Scoping review of evidence-based practice guidelines for the evaluation and care of young children with developmental disabilities in LMIC settings: evidence for action [^07c1f694]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Environmental and socioeconomic factors

Both environmental and socioeconomic factors influence a young child's brain maturation and neurodevelopment. While HIC guidelines often focus on biomedical risks, incorporating broader social determinants and a humanistic approach can enhance personal relevance and equity. Growing evidence highlights the scientific relationship between early life experiences, physical health and future neurodevelopmental patterns. Therefore, the effective implementation of clinical guidelines should take these factors into careful consideration. Integrating this awareness promotes cultural sensitivity and supports a more humanistic approach — one that incorporates both medical and neurodiversity models while emphasising human dignity and individual potential.

Monitoring early child developmental profiles

Comprehensive early child developmental monitoring is vital to be integrated into routine child health visits in order to support and guide best practice even if there is not good evidence for any tool being perfect at screening level in terms of specificity. While LMICs often lack validated, culturally adapted tools to achieve this, some tools have been successfully modified. Implementation approaches, however, must be tailored to the local context, with local norming and linguistic appropriateness crucial for effective surveillance. The use of developmental tools to guide assessment should, however, when possible, have normative data for local populations of children, be culturally modifiable and offered within the family's own primary language.

Broadening already existing guidelines and identifying comorbidities

Several existing practice guidelines for specific physical illnesses can be adapted for broader use. For example, WHO's international guideline for the Treatment and Care of Persons affected by the Zika, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, and the WHO Pocketbook of primary healthcare for children and adolescents could be adapted to support children with DDs using transdisciplinary approaches. Recognising comorbidities that often coexistmay be helpful, such as those with ASD or epilepsy syndromes who have significant co-occurring feeding, nutritional or cardiac difficulties. The adaptation of any clinical care guideline between different settings should take into account key regional and local supports and barriers to early childhood healthcare and education inclusion services.

Comprehensive (when feasible) interdisciplinary assessments

Overall, current practice guidelines highlight the importance of collaborative teamwork guiding comprehensive diagnostic and monitoring and evaluation processes. Collaborative, community-based assessments are vital but challenging in resource-limited contexts with few trained professionals. Although, ideally, professionals could collaborate across fields to prioritise the goals and needs of the child and family, there is a need for clearer frameworks on what constitutes interdisciplinary evaluation and how to implement it efficiently.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^4ce03a78]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
A developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder: main principles

In France, teachers working in daycare hospitals and medico-educational institutes are specialized teachers belonging to the French public school system who are available to meet the needs of disabled children hosted in care institutions. Teachers usually receive in their classroom the children of the institution for short time sessions, individually or in small groups. For this study, they were trained to structure the classroom space and time session. The setting was a small classroom with 3 or 4 pupils, including a desk for each child, with two chairs (one for the child, one for the adult facing him to work with the child), a screen presenting pictures of the child's schedule, and a locker. The child sat with his/her back close to the wall where the screen was placed (Fig. 2). The setting also included a large table for mid-session group snacks and an area with benches and carpets for the gathering sessions of all participants (both children and adults) with repetitive social activities at the beginning and end of a session.

The customized educational program followed developmental rules by focusing on the nearest expected activity or skill, given a child's development in a particular area. Given that the program was curriculum-based, there were specific educational objectives for each child. The teacher created the curriculum and its objectives following academic recommendations from the French Ministry of National Education. Academic objectives involved four domains: language and communication, mathematics, intermodality, and autonomous behaviors. Because the DS1-EI by design follows a developmental approach, we performed a detailed assessment and curriculum for each child's academic program. The curriculum allowed selecting appropriate cognitive/motor activities for training a given child within each above listed domain.

### Perinatal and postpartum health among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities [^26785f7a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Among more than 430 000 Medicaid-enrolled pregnancies and deliveries over a 12-year period among a diverse, nationwide sample of birthing people, we observed that birthing people with IDD were significantly younger at first delivery, had fewer live births, and had markedly higher rates of obstetric and co-occurring physical and mental health conditions in the year before and after delivery than their peers without IDD. The greatest disparities were observed in rates of co-occurring mental health conditions, yet all marked differences persisted after accounting for important covariates. Similar disparities were observed for the subgroups of autistic people and those with ID compared with people without IDD. The robust results clearly reveal a profile of a diverse group of birthing people with IDD who are both younger and substantially more burdened with serious obstetric and co-occurring health conditions than other birthing people in the US.

The younger age at delivery of the birthing people with IDD and the left shift of the age distribution of the subgroup of autistic people compared with people without IDD are important warning signs. There are reported gaps in the provision of reproductive health and planning, sexual education, and pregnancy-related knowledge to people with disabilities. Reproductive health education starting in adolescence for people and, when relevant, their caregivers and educating health care professionals, of the potential reproductive and co-occurring health concerns of this vulnerable population are underexamined topics. Centering people with IDD in future research is essential to understanding their experiences and needs, including prioritization of partnerships in developing reproductive education resources for people with IDD, support for their families in understanding and addressing their needs, and curricula for health care professionals.

### Using a life course health development framework to combat stigma-related health disparities for individuals with intellectual and / or developmental disability (I / DD) [^73b706ea]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In the U.S., 1 in 6 children has an intellectual and/or developmental disability (I/DD). This population experiences a multitude of negative health outcomes across the life course, relative to the general population. Stigma-the social devaluation of individuals with certain characteristics, identities, or statuses within interpersonal, educational, healthcare, and policy contexts-is a potentially preventable contributor to health disparities. To date, existing approaches for addressing and preventing stigma are limited to discrete and siloed interventions that often fail to address the lifelong, cumulative impacts of the specific types of stigma experienced by the I/DD population. In the current paper, we describe three elements of Life Course Health Development (LCHD)-a novel translational framework that draws on evidence from biology, sociology, epidemiology, and psychology-that healthcare providers can use to prevent stigma-related health disparities and improve outcomes for individuals with I//DDs. We discuss the utility of targeting prevention to sensitive periods; prioritizing interventions for the most damaging types of stigmas; and leveraging supports from multiple service systems and sectors. By incorporating evidence from life course science into efforts to address stigma-related health disparities, providers can more effectively and strategically prevent and combat stigma-related health disparities for the I/DD population in childhood and across the life course.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^48d5fce1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

GLMM model

We used General Linear Mixed-effect Models to account for repeated measures (lme4 and lmer Test packages). Primary and secondary endpoints were used separately as a variable to be explained in the models. The effects were adjusted on the IQ/DQ score at baseline. All effects were fixed except the "subject" effect, which was a random effect. Explanatory variables in the model were DQ score at baseline, group, time, group*time interaction and subjects as random effect. The goal of assessing group*time interaction was to show whether change over time would differ between the two groups. To correct any bias, we planned to include covariates that showed an initial time imbalance in the multivariate model. Ultimately, none were required. For each judgment criterion, the p -values of group, time and group*time interaction effect were calculated, along with the endpoints delta and the estimated effect size using Cohen's d formula for each group. The institutions entered the research in a phased manner (from June 2013 to June 2014), but within each of the 11 institutions, recruitment was done at all at once. Intermediate analyses were planned at 12, 18 and 24 months when all 11 institutions had completed each of these measures. Here, we present the results of these intermediate analyses.

### Validation of the NIH toolbox cognitive battery in intellectual disability [^36d21a60]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To advance the science of cognitive outcome measurement for individuals with intellectual disability (ID), we established administration guidelines and evaluated the psychometric properties of the NIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIHTB-CB) for use in clinical research.

Methods

We assessed feasibility, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity of the NIHTB-CB (measuring executive function, processing speed, memory, and language) by assessing 242 individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS), Down syndrome (DS), and other ID, ages 6 through 25 years, with retesting completed after 1 month. To facilitate accessibility and measurement accuracy, we developed accommodations and standard assessment guidelines, documented in an e-manual. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of the battery to expected syndrome-specific cognitive phenotypes.

Results

Above a mental age of 5.0 years, all tests had excellent feasibility. More varied feasibility across tests was seen between mental ages of 3 and 4 years. Reliability and convergent validity ranged from moderate to strong. Each test and the Crystallized and Fluid Composite scores correlated moderately to strongly with IQ, and the Crystallized Composite had modest correlations with adaptive behavior. The NIHTB-CB showed known-groups validity by detecting expected executive function deficits in FXS and a receptive language deficit in DS.

Conclusion

The NIHTB-CB is a reliable and valid test battery for children and young adults with ID with a mental age of ≈5 years and above. Adaptations for very low-functioning or younger children with ID are needed for some subtests to expand the developmental range of the battery. Studies examining sensitivity to developmental and treatment changes are now warranted.

### Development and evaluation of a patient education programme for children, adolescents, and young adults with differences of sex development (DSD) and their parents: study protocol of empower-DSD [^adbb1956]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Data management

For the online-based data assessment we use the remote data capture system REDCap. Separate questionnaires were programmed for the target groups based on age and diagnostic groups. Before the study centres started the field work, they were trained in using REDCap by the central data management following a standardised training scheme.

The participant information form contains all the relevant information used to assign the diagnosis- and target group-specific questionnaires in the surveys. Family relationships are also assigned via this form, so that the responses of the parents can be linked to those of the associated children. The study included the following 4 groups: (i) children aged 6 to 13 years, (ii) adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, (iii) young adults aged 18 to 24 years (all groups with links to the corresponding parental questionnaires), (iv) parents of children newly diagnosed within the last two years. Baseline and follow-up assessments were separately programmed for each age group. Access codes for baseline and 3 follow-up assessments were generated for each participant and included the individual participant information.

Complex alpha-numeric pseudonyms are used as links between diagnosis- and age group-specific questionnaires. The pseudonyms were generated at the central data management. A list with a sufficient number of pseudonyms together with guidelines for documenting the use of them was sent to each study centre before the recruitment started.

The following quality assurance tasks are important in this project phase on the part of the central data management:

(i) Checking the family assignments for correctness, if necessary submit queries to the study centre. This ensures the correct assignment of questionnaires to the different assessment time points, but it is also essential for future evaluations in terms of linking questionnaire responses of parents with those of their children.

(ii) Verifying that questionnaires have been completed. A message regarding the completeness of the questionnaires is also included in the participant information. This was subsequently added by the central data management to help the local study nurses keeping track.

During the course of the project, it is important to keep a close communication between the central data management and the study centres to identify sources of error early and to correct them quickly, if possible.

Personal data from the qualitative interviews (e.g. audios) are only stored digitally with special access authorisation. Audios, complete transcripts or other person-identifying data are only transport encrypted, e.g. with a VeraCrypt container. Only pseudonymised data will be analysed.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^e47be00a]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Transition planning for youth with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) emphasizes early preparation and least-restrictive, rights-based supports. An estimated 750 000 youth in the United States transition into adulthood each year, and on their 18th birthday a youth reaches the age of majority and assumes independent decision-making rights. Health care guidance recommends initiating transition planning at 12–14 years of age. Because 1 in 6 children (17%) between the ages of 3 and 17 years have a developmental disability, transition planning should include discussions about alternative decision-making arrangements when there are concerns about capacity at the age of majority. Pediatricians are encouraged to uphold human rights and human dignity for all youth; for patients with limited decision-making capacity, pediatricians should understand the various levels of autonomy and guardianship, should be familiar with local resources, and may be called upon to assist in finding the best solutions. Federal laws affirmed by Supreme Court decisions uphold the rights of US citizens with IDD to reside in least restrictive appropriate environments and to receive resources enabling inclusion, therefore fostering autonomy and supporting the least restrictive alternative for decision-making are essential when independent decision-making is not appropriate. Historically, pediatricians have rarely discussed the legal aspects of transition to adult-oriented services with youth with IDD and their families.

### Equitable care for patients with disabilities: considerations for the gynecologic health care professional [^15de307c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

All patients deserve high-quality health care. Patients with disabilities have historically experienced discrimination in health care and subsequently detrimental health outcomes. Health care professionals often lack confidence and preparedness in treating patients with disabilities effectively. Barriers such as communication difficulties, biased assumptions, and inadequate equipment hinder comprehensive care. These barriers to care lead to health inequalities and a diminished overall quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Existing clinical guidelines for care of this underserved population are lacking. This article establishes a comprehensive educational framework and accessible reference tools for gynecologic health care professionals to enhance their ability to offer inclusive and effective care to patients with disabilities. Insights in this article stem from expert consensus among clinicians experienced in this field and ongoing dialog with community-based disability care partners. We present actionable steps to cultivate an open, adaptable, and patient-centric method to actively engage patients and to provide suitable accommodations when needed.

### A paradigm for improving transition planning for adolescents with intellectual developmental disorder [^dcebbc9e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Families of children with intellectual and developmental disorder (IDD) face unique challenges while navigating the transition into adulthood, such as finding suitable housing, optimizing independence, fostering meaningful relationships, and identifying a vocation. 1–3 Often, the daily struggles of managing the individual's needs overshadow essential long-term preparation. Individuals with IDD and their families need guidance to transition from an entitlement-driven system (special education) to multiple eligibility-driven systems (adult care, postsecondary education services, housing supports, etc). The majority of those currently involved in transition planning are school personnel, followed closely by family members. Few of these planning meetings include the individuals themselves or personnel from outside agencies, such as social services and mental health. 2 The complexity of these systems marginalizes this population by creating barriers to accessing necessary support. This is where psychiatrists, especially child and adolescent psychiatrists, can create a bridge.

### The individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA) for children with special educational needs [^4eef5564]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Identifying children for EI or special education — referral pathways and timelines: Developmental surveillance and screening by the primary care provider often lead to identification and referral to appropriate resources, including psychologists or pediatric subspecialists, and to local early intervention (EI) programs for age 0–3 years or school for 3 years and older, with parents also able to self‑refer. After a referral to the school system, the school must determine whether to evaluate; if an evaluation is conducted, the parent must give informed, written consent, the "comprehensive, multidisciplinary" evaluation must be completed by the school within 60 days of the parental consent (unless the state has a different timeline), and a meeting must be conducted to develop an IEP within 30 days of the eligibility determination, after which services are to be made available as soon as possible. If the district decides not to evaluate, it must provide prior written notice with reasons and supporting information, and at each step the district must provide a written response to any parental written request; follow‑up by the health care provider can help determine whether the child is evaluated appropriately. Further guidance and forms are available in AAP clinical reports cited on the page.

### A transition toolkit for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^dc1a6f92]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The care of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) now extends into adulthood. Childhood to adulthood transition planning is an important aspect of care, affecting health outcomes as well as other important aspects of adult life. In this article, we address transition planning as it relates to DMD health care, education, steps toward vocations, personal care, accessing the home and community, and the importance of relationships with others. Because of the complex, disabling, and progressive nature of DMD, coordinated, well-timed planning is critical to ensure that all components of transition are accomplished. In this article, we introduce the DMD Transition Toolkit. The toolkit is designed to help assess readiness for transition, track progress toward transition goals, and provide a template for documenting key elements of medical care, medical equipment, and services. The transition readiness assessment for young adults with DMD is used to gauge readiness for adult health care and living practices. Consistent with the 2018 DMD Care Considerations, the transition checklist for young adults with DMD is a comprehensive list to be considered, discussed, and planned for during transition. The medical summary for young adults with DMD can be used by a provider or individuals with DMD to communicate details of their health plan, provider contacts, and medical equipment needs. It can be used in transition handoffs, when adding new providers, or when informing new nursing agencies or personal care attendants. It could also be useful in urgent care settings by providing baseline information about the individual with DMD.

### Parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disability [^09161f5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Research suggests that the number of intellectually disabled people with children is increasing. Intellectual disabilities do not inevitably cause parenting difficulties, but it may impact on an individual's capacity to parent a child effectively. Children of parents with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of neglectful care, which could lead to health, developmental and behavioural problems, or increased risk of intellectual disability. Compared with other parents, those with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be involved in care proceedings.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities designed to support parenting, parent-child relations, safe parenting or family environments, or to develop parenting skills.

Search Methods

In July 2017, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and six other databases as well as two trials registers. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field to identify additional ongoing and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities with treatment as usual or a control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standardised Cochrane methods.

Main Results

As of July 2017, we identified four trials with 192 participants that met the review inclusion criteria. Participating parents were mostly mothers (seven fathers were included in two studies), and children's ages ranged from one month to six years and five months. One study was conducted in Australia, one in Canada, one in the Netherlands, and one in the USA. Each studied a different intervention and considered different outcomes. Three interventions were delivered at home, and one in a community venue (e.g. a church). Interventions varied in duration from seven weeks to 12 months. They included a range of practical childcare skills, home safety and developing parents' ability to respond sensitively to their children. Parents in the comparison groups included in the review received treatment as usual and most of these received the index intervention after the study was complete. One study was funded by the Ontario Mental Health Foundation and the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services Research Grants Program; one by the Alabama Development Disabilities Council; one by the Best Practice Parenting Education Initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services and the New South Wales Aging and Disability Department; and one by ZonMw, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development. It was not possible for us to conduct a meta-analysis. The GRADE quality assessment varied from very low to moderate across the studies. Primary outcomesNo study reported on the 'attainment of specific parenting skill targets". afe home practices' and 'understanding of child health': one study (30 parents, very low-quality evidence) reported some improvements in parents' knowledge of life-threatening emergencies, ability to recognise dangers, and identify precautions, in favour of the intervention group. It also found limited, very low-quality evidence that parent training improved parents' ability to understand child health, implement precautions, use medicines safely, recognise child illness and symptoms, and seek medical advice (i.e. visit the doctor). Another study (22 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved attainment of skills related to childcare and safety, in favour of the intervention group. Secondary outcomes'Parent-child interaction': one study (40 mothers, very low-quality evidence) reported improved maternal-child interaction following parent training at 12 months follow-up. Another study (83 mothers, 2 fathers, moderate-quality evidence) reported that inclusion in the intervention group led to a steeper decline in parenting stress related to the child compared to the control group'. arents' retention of child': one study (22 participants; very low-quality evidence) reported that before joining the programme nine of 11 (82%) families with a previous child had had the child removed from their care by child protection authorities due to maternal maltreatment, compared with only four of 22 (19%) families after participating in the programme (only one of these four mothers had also had a previous child removed). No study reported data on: 'return to independent care of child' or 'lifting of child-related court order'.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some very low-quality evidence that some parents, mainly mothers, with intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate parenting if they are given appropriate training and support to learn the parenting skills they need. However, there are few studies exploring how interventions might work, for whom and in what circumstances. In particular, there have been few studies that include fathers with intellectual disabilities, or that explore the views of parents themselves. There is a need for larger RCTs of parenting interventions, with longer follow-up, before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of parent training for this group of parents.

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^b171f8d9]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for assessment and intervention with persons with disabilities — functional assessment "measures how a person interacts with the environment and focuses on various domains of real-life skills" and "may include both use of functional measures and observation". It "may be particularly useful for clients with intellectual disabilities and those with multiple barriers to testing". Functional measures "may include the observation of a range of skills" across living, working, social, and learning environments, and the process "also incorporates disability accommodations". With appropriate adaptation, "both behavior and environment may become targets for intervention". Several functional measures have "adequate reliability and validity", and computerized administration "has helped reduce the number of items and amount of time needed", though "some concerns have been raised about the algorithms".

### A pilot test to support healthcare providers in promoting vaccine uptake among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities [^2105b159]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities encounter barriers to vaccine access, uptake, and confidence, leading to health inequities. These include barriers related to healthcare provider capacity to effectively address the social determinants of health, provide accessible needle procedures, and translate and disseminate inclusive public health information. The current study aimed to test the preliminary effectiveness of a virtual continuing medical education (CME) course on enhancing healthcare provider capacity to address these barriers. This CME was available free-of-charge online. Participants included 120 healthcare providers (physicians: 45%; nurses: 37%; and other learners: 18%) in internal medicine, family practice, and related disciplines. The CME-created based on video interviews with patients and providers-focused on factors that affect vaccine uptake/access/confidence (Module 1); strategies to increase vaccine receipt (Module 2); and inclusive public health communication (Module 3). The pre-post survey assessed self-reported understanding, confidence, and abilities. Following CME completion, learners were significantly more likely to report higher understanding, confidence, and abilities in responding to the social determinants of health (Module 1); addressing barriers to vaccine access/uptake/confidence (Module 2); and engaging in effective public health communication (Module 3). Findings support the utility of short-term healthcare provider trainings on this topic. Future research should evaluate longer-term impacts and identify opportunities to create standardized medical curricula for this population.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^d3d3b4ab]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The morning session was structured in two ways. First, the 2.5 h session followed an expected, structured agenda that each child received on a screen. Second, every 10–15 min, professionals (teacher or assistants) were asked to change desks and activities. Thus, each 10–15 min, children had a new activity and a new teacher or assistant in order to maintain their attention, to challenge their need for sameness and to help generalize social and scholastic abilities. In sum, the structured context is meant to allow the child to be able to work with a variety of teachers and to experiment with new interpersonal relationships but in a rather predictable way.

Each classroom was overseen by a teacher aided by assistants as per the 1-to-1 program design. The assistants were specialized educators or nurses who care for the children inside the institution during the day, through other forms of intervention (individual or group approaches using various support methods and aiming to develop relational or instrumental abilities). All professionals (the teacher and the assistants) received a one-week session including: (1) an overview of the method (using positive affect, shared engagement, responsiveness and sensitivity to children's cues); (2) specific instructions (focusing on verbal and nonverbal communication and supporting positive behaviors rather than tackling challenging behaviors). The DS1-EI detailed assessment/curriculum was explained, including how to best align learning proposals with a child's particular developmental needs.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: considerations and recommendations for prescribing exercise and designing physical activity programs for people with disabilities [^9928b50f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). High credibility.

ACSM Expert Consensus — Table 3 guidance for positive conversational interactions outlines concrete "Do" and "Don't" communication practices with persons with disabilities. Do items include "Ask if the individual's preference of person-first or identity-first language" and "Educate yourself on the person's disability by seeking out information", as well as "Discuss with the individual and their parent/caregiver (if appropriate) to better understand the individual's needs and wants". Don't items include "Presume a person's preference for using person-first or identity-first language", "Assume the individual has experience with specific exercises or physical activities such as walking on a treadmill or riding a bike", and "Rely on a one-size-fits-all approach to communicating".

### Working together to address disability in a culturally-appropriate and sustainable manner [^00f9e8b5]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Disability has an enormous impact throughout the world. An increasing amount of important disability research and practice is being undertaken in low-income settings; however, success and sustainability of programmes in these contexts can often be challenging. We share lessons from our experiences.

Method

We reviewed past literature and international consensus statements relating to disability and development practice. We then held several face to face and email discussions to document the key lessons we have learnt from working in this context. We report on these in this paper.

Results

The key lessons are to invest adequate time and develop trusting relationships, undertake sufficient consultation and collaboration, include and empower persons with disability, and view capacity building as a two-way process.

Conclusions

Improving the lives of persons with disability in development contexts is likely to be best achieved through processes that are inclusive, owned and driven by local communities.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^ffe6ab85]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Assessment of psychiatric comorbidities in intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder (ID/IDD) is guided by prior AACAP guidance that recommend a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for individuals who present with psychiatric or behavioral symptoms, including assessment of current behavior, behaviors typical of developmental age, and comparison to baseline. Questions asked of the child can be simplified and extra time allowed for the child to process and respond, and clinicians should avoid leading questions and monitor for comprehension. Knowledgeable informants are essential for identifying symptoms and functioning across settings and for considering the child's underlying impairment. Expectations for learning and behavior are guided by developmental level, not chronological age, and psychiatric diagnoses consist only of symptoms in excess of or atypical for the child's developmental level that cause impairment. Clinicians should remain alert to "diagnostic overshadowing", in which co-occurring psychiatric disorders are missed because symptoms are attributed to ID/IDD.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^05611c1c]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder (ID/IDD) — developmental onset and course — Onset is defined in DSM-5 as occurring during the developmental period; in the first 2 years of life delayed motor, language, and social milestones may be identified in individuals with severe ID/IDD, whereas mild ID/IDD may not be identified until school age. Although ID/IDD is generally lifelong, it is not a static disability; early and ongoing interventions may improve adaptive functioning throughout childhood and adulthood, and in some cases result in significant improvement such that the diagnosis of ID/IDD is no longer appropriate. Impairments can be reduced by provision of personalized services and supports, and cognitive and adaptive impairments may also improve with treatment of co-occurring medical conditions or worsen with progression of genetic disorders.

### Equitable and accessible informed healthcare consent process for people with intellectual disability: a systematic literature review [^02d42ee8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To identify factors acting as barriers or enablers to the process of healthcare consent for people with intellectual disability and to understand how to make this process equitable and accessible.

Data Sources

Databases: Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and CINAHL. Additional articles were obtained from an ancestral search and hand-searching three journals.

Eligibility Criteria

Peer-reviewed original research about the consent process for healthcare interventions, published after 1990, involving adult participants with intellectual disability.

Synthesis Of Results

Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify factors affecting informed consent. The findings were reviewed by co-researchers with intellectual disability to ensure they reflected lived experiences, and an easy read summary was created.

Results

Twenty-three studies were included (1999 to 2020), with a mix of qualitative (n = 14), quantitative (n = 6) and mixed-methods (n = 3) studies. Participant numbers ranged from 9 to 604 people (median 21) and included people with intellectual disability, health professionals, carers and support people, and others working with people with intellectual disability. Six themes were identified: (1) health professionals' attitudes and lack of education, (2) inadequate accessible health information, (3) involvement of support people, (4) systemic constraints, (5) person-centred informed consent and (6) effective communication between health professionals and patients. Themes were barriers (themes 1, 2 and 4), enablers (themes 5 and 6) or both (theme 3).

Conclusions

Multiple reasons contribute to poor consent practices for people with intellectual disability in current health systems. Recommendations include addressing health professionals' attitudes and lack of education in informed consent with clinician training, the co-production of accessible information resources and further inclusive research into informed consent for people with intellectual disability.

### Developing genetic literacy in high school students with intellectual disability: teachers' experiences and perspectives [^ef99b47e]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetics is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to achieve improved health outcomes through precision medicine. People with intellectual disability have asked to know more about genetic conditions that they may have, but require education to build their genetic literacy, thereby empowering them to make informed healthcare decisions. Key to this is ensuring students with intellectual disability can access and participate in genetics education at school. Despite integration of genetics into curriculum, little is known about whether teachers are equipped to engage students with intellectual disability with this content. To explore this issue, fifteen teachers who teach genetic content to students with intellectual disability participated in semi-structured interviews or in a focus group. The analysis revealed three interconnected themes addressing genetics education for students with intellectual disability. These themes encompassed effective pedagogical approaches and curriculum adaptations, the necessity for targeted professional development with appropriate resources, and the importance of fostering comprehensive genetic literacy across the entire school community to build capacity among students, staff, and families. These findings have widespread implications for supporting teachers to develop genetic literacy in students with intellectual disability. A key recommendation is to create professional learning and a suite of accessible, multimodal, online resources for students with intellectual disability, their teachers, and the broader school community.

### Advances in managing transition to adulthood for adolescents with congenital heart disease: a practical approach to transition program design: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4b854872]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive Deficits

An individual's transition goals must reflect their unique neurodevelopmental abilities, strengths and weaknesses. This is particularly relevant to the field of congenital heart disease, in which patients are at elevated risk of neurodevelopmental deficits and disorders in many domains including academic achievement, language and speech, visual perception, fine and gross motor skills, attention, and executive functioning. Both prevalence and severity of neurocognitive deficits increase in accordance with congenital heart disease complexity and the presence of genetic syndromes. Unfortunately, transition experiences and outcomes are known to be poorer for youth and young adults with neurodevelopmental disorders.

There are unique challenges when coordinating the transition of youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities from pediatric to adult care. These include: (1) identification of appropriate models of autonomy, (2) provision of appropriate, healthy, and respectful behaviors of health care professionals, (3) proactive incorporation of principles of ethics within transition programs as well as the evaluation of transition initiatives, and (4) responsiveness to the unique needs of youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities. For youth with congenital heart disease, the approach to patient education and self‐management skills training should therefore be respectful and flexible. Additional consideration needs to be given to establishing a medical power of attorney for those with severe neurocognitive deficits and a shared decision‐making pathway for those with less severe neurocognitive deficits. Ideally, this is discussed and formally documented before transfer.

Whereas most individuals with congenital heart disease will be able to eventually assume full responsibility for their health care oversight, the transition needs of those with cognitive deficits have not been well studied. Patients with more severe neurodevelopmental deficits have traditionally been excluded from transition surveys and interview/intervention research. Effective transition, especially for those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, demands engagement by all key stakeholders including patients, parents/caregivers, pediatric and adult congenital heart disease professionals, and other members of the health care team such as teachers, social workers, or counselors. Further, shared decision making and coordination within the broader care team is essential to support a proactive, developmental, and family‐based approach for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^aef896a0]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Supervision involved 2 different steps: 1) daily peer supervision sessions of verbal exchanges and written observations after class about each child in each domain with all professionals; 2) weekly supervision by a psychologist who gave support related to clinical issues, team clinical cohesion and proper adherence to DS1-EI implementation. To ensure fidelity of DS1-EI implementation and application over time, the main investigator (A H-B) came on each site at the beginning of the 3-year program and then at least 3 times per year to observe an entire morning session, to update each child's academic objectives and to discuss any deviations for protocol or adjustments needed. Daily written observations were given to the main investigator. A formal fidelity grid was rated during the visits (see Additional file 2). In addition, an external audit examined on-site application of the protocol. They concluded that " the observed homogeneity in program's application shows that the on-site teams were engaged in an active process of formation and supervision to obtain a consistency in concrete intervention procedures as well as time and space structuring and individual strategies ".

Data control and statistical analysis

The number of patients to enroll was based on the following theoretical statistics estimation: for a moderate effect size (α = 0.6), a power fixed at 80%, and a level of significance for a p -value fixed at < 0.05, 80 patients randomized into two groups are required for a student t -test. Given our choice to use linear mixed models (see below) to take into account participant's effect, we planned to recruit from 70 to 80 participants. The data were analyzed with the statistical program R, version 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), using two-tailed tests and a level of significance set at 5%.

### Examining older adults with neuroatypical conditions for MCI / dementia: barriers and recommendations of the neuroatypical conditions expert consultative panel [^31b7927c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

The Neuroatypical Conditions Expert Consultative Panel composed of numerous clinical and academic experts was convened to examine barriers to the examination of cognitive impairment in adults with a variety of neuroatypical conditions. Neuroatypical conditions affect normative intellectual development and function (such as intellectual disability and intellectual disability with conjoint psychiatric conditions), thought, moods, and cognition (such as severe mental illness), communication functions (such as the autism spectrum and hearing/vision impairments), and brain and motor function (such as cerebral palsy and acquired or traumatic brain injury). The panel concluded that current federal guidance for the assessment of cognitive impairment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia does not sufficiently include information as to how to assess such adults. In addition, it concluded that adults with these conditions (1) challenge clinicians when attempting to discern current behavior and function from that which was pre-existing; (2) often have inherent comprehension and oral communication difficulties, motor task performance impediments, and difficulty with visuals; and (3) pose difficulties when assessed with standardized dementia measures and can benefit from the use of specialized instruments. The panel recommended that federal guidance be broadened to include adaptations of assessment practices to accommodate neuroatypical conditions; that educational packs be developed for clinicians about such conditions and on detecting and diagnosing MCI or dementia; and that research be expanded to produce more evidence-based information on both assessing adults with neuroatypical conditions for later-life adult cognitive diseases/disorders and planning post-diagnostic care.

### Intellectual developmental disorders: towards a new name, definition and framework for "mental retardation / intellectual disability" in ICD-11 [^fd387859]. World Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Although "intellectual disability" has widely replaced the term "mental retardation", the debate as to whether this entity should be conceptualized as a health condition or as a disability has intensified as the revision of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) advances. Defining intellectual disability as a health condition is central to retaining it in ICD, with significant implications for health policy and access to health services. This paper presents the consensus reached to date by the WHO ICD Working Group on the Classification of Intellectual Disabilities. Literature reviews were conducted and a mixed qualitative approach was followed in a series of meetings to produce consensus-based recommendations combining prior expert knowledge and available evidence. The Working Group proposes replacing mental retardation with intellectual developmental disorders, defined as "a group of developmental conditions characterized by significant impairment of cognitive functions, which are associated with limitations of learning, adaptive behaviour and skills". The Working Group further advises that intellectual developmental disorders be incorporated in the larger grouping (parent category) of neurodevelopmental disorders, that current subcategories based on clinical severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, profound) be continued, and that problem behaviours be removed from the core classification structure of intellectual developmental disorders and instead described as associated features.

### Toward actionable practice parameters for "Dual diagnosis": principles of assessment and management for Co-occurring psychiatric and intellectual / developmental disability [^daef1a47]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

When traumatic stress underlies PS for an individual with IDD, supports should incorporate a variety of methods including a focus on principles of positive identity development (self-identity, self-efficacy) and efforts to build social-emotional learning skills such as self-awareness (identifying emotions, accurate self-perception, recognizing strengths, self-confidence, self-efficacy); an emphasis on self-management (impulse control, stress management, self-discipline, self-motivation, goal setting, organizational skills); instruction for social awareness (perspective-taking, empathy, appreciating diversity, respect for others); development of relationship skills (communication, social engagement, relationship building, teamwork); and guidance toward responsible decision-making (identifying problems, analyzing situations, solving problems, evaluating, reflecting, ethical responsibility) — all with the goals of promoting resiliency and preventing future traumatic experiences. All individuals may benefit when care-providers slow down their speech, use language for the individual to understand, present information one point at a time, take frequent pauses to check comprehension, use multisensory input, make specific suggestions for change, allow the individual some time to practice new skills, avoid assumptions that the presented information will generalize to other settings, and include multiple caregivers across various environments. Building family protective factors is also key. This can be accomplished by providing support to families that include asking and answering caregiver questions, providing timely information, addressing traumatic caregiver experiences, promoting secure attachment, promoting a healing and protective environment, fostering family-informed, person-centered planning, helping families access trauma-related supports, partnering with parents to create a recovery plan, and helping families navigate the challenges of systems of care. A trauma-informed approach focuses on safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural competence. Applying these principles when working with individuals with co-occurring disorders has been shown to foster resilience and recovery.

### Perinatal and postpartum health among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities [^8413123b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Findings from this cohort study present a need to tailor reproductive health education, perinatal care, and delivery services to ensure comprehensive and targeted support for birthing people with IDD. Designing and implementing policies aligned with and guided by the needs of people with IDD can lead to reductions in maternal health disparities. Advances to this objective may be accelerated by adapting current clinical guidelines and procedures associated with the specific needs and experiences of people with IDD. The effectiveness of new Medicaid policies in improving the health profile of birthing people with IDD, such as the postpartum coverage extension, should be assessed by tracking potential variation in outcomes after implementation of these policies.

### Beginning reading interventions for children and adolescents with intellectual disability [^5a0cf21e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, students with intellectual disability were not expected to learn to read, and thus were excluded from reading instruction. Over the past decades, societal expectations for this group of learners have changed in that children and adolescents with intellectual disability are now expected to be provided with, and benefit from, literacy instruction. This shift in societal expectations has also led to an increase in research examining effective interventions for increasing beginning reading skills for students with intellectual disability.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for teaching beginning reading skills to children and adolescents with intellectual disability.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2019: CENTRAL; MEDLINE, including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, 13 other databases, and two trials registers. We contacted authors of included studies, examined reference lists, and used Google Scholar to search for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (including trials that use quasi-random methods of allocation such as date of birth), involving children and adolescents with intellectual disability (defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) two standard deviations or more below the population mean) between the ages of 4 and 21 years, that evaluated the efficacy of a beginning reading intervention compared to a control intervention, including no treatment control, wait-list control, treatment as usual, attention control, or alternate non-reading instruction control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria, and extracted data from each trial using a piloted data extraction form to collect information about the population, intervention, randomization methods, blinding, sample size, outcome measures, follow-up duration, attrition and handling of missing data, and methods of analysis. When data were missing, one review author contacted the study authors to request additional information. Two review authors assessed the risk of bias of each included study and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (a systematic method for rating the certainty of evidence in meta-analyses). We conducted random-effect meta-analyses, with inverse-variance weighting to combine effect sizes for each of our primary and secondary outcomes. We presented effect sizes as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified seven studies involving 352 children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities that met the inclusion criteria. All studies provided the intervention in school settings. Four studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada, and two in the UK. Three studies were funded by grants from the US Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences; one study by the Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network and the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation; and three studies did not indicate a funding source. We identified some concerns with risk of bias, mainly due to the difficulty of blinding of participants and personnel, and the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Meta-analyses of the data demonstrated small-to-moderate effects of beginning reading interventions delivered to children and adolescents with intellectual disability across four dependent variables. We found medium effect sizes in favor of the beginning reading interventions for the primary outcomes of phonologic awareness (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.86; 4 studies, 178 participants; moderate-quality evidence), word reading (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.03; 5 studies, 220 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and decoding (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67; 5 studies, 230 participants; low-quality evidence). The studies reported no adverse events. We also found a moderate effect for the secondary outcomes of oral reading fluency (SMD 0.65, 95% CI -0.12 to 1.42; 2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence) and language skills (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; 3 studies, 222 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Results from this review provide evidence that beginning reading interventions that include elements of phonologic awareness, letter sound instruction, and decoding, delivered to children and adolescents with intellectual disability, are associated with small-to-moderate improvements in phonologic awareness, word reading, decoding, expressive and receptive language, and oral reading fluency. These findings are aligned with previously conducted studies that examined the effects of reading interventions for people without intellectual disability.

### Scoping review of evidence-based practice guidelines for the evaluation and care of young children with developmental disabilities in LMIC settings: evidence for action [^a64e1bc4]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Information sources

We conducted a literature search using key terms on major databases, including PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL as well as the websites of professional paediatric associations (online supplemental file 1) using Google search. We also searched grey literature databases and reviewed reference lists of included studies to find additional articles for consideration. The detailed search terms comprised the index, and free terms of the different DDs and the evidence-based recommendations combined with Boolean operators ("OR" and "AND"). Each of the conditions was searched separately on the Google search. The key search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 2. The databases were searched on 21 September 2022, while the Google searches were done between 6 October 2022 and August 2023. The literature search was updated on 12 June 2024. The relevant journal articles were screened by title and full paper using Covidence software. The first 100 hits on Google search were retrieved and those that appeared relevant were reviewed (figure 2).

Figure 2
PRISMA diagram showing flow from identification, screening to inclusion of evidence-based guidelines on developmental disabilities. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Selection of evidence sources

Three reviewers (DoM, AMM and DeM) independently screened the articles by title, abstract and full paper. These three were supported by the wider authorship group who all had specialised expertise in childhood DDs. Any discrepancies in the articles screened were resolved by reassessment of the article, discussion and consensus.

Data extraction

We developed a data extraction template into which we entered data on the characteristics of the identified practice guidelines, such as the author, publication date, professional organisation that developed the clinical guideline, country it was developed in, type of DDs, age of children, population the clinical guideline is intended for, scope of the practice guidelines and summary recommendations.

Quality assessment

We used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II)to assess the quality of reporting of the practice guidelines. AGREE II has a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) for 23 items grouped into six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence. For each of the 23 items, a score of 7 indicates an exceptional reporting that meets all the criteria while 2–6 partially meets the criteria. Therefore, higher percentage scores reflect exceptional reporting. The appraisal was conducted independently by DoM, AMM and DeM for each domain.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^b5943967]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Feasibility and acceptability

The diagram flow is shown in Fig. 3. A total of 75 participants were screened, but only 72 were included after randomization, as 3 were excluded. One family refused the randomization assigned to their child, which led further to the exclusion of the two patients of that initial pairing. One participant was recruited for inclusion and randomization, but as the institution was not able to find another child to form a pair for randomization, this participant was excluded. Of those 72 subjects in the ITT, 36 were randomized to each group. After randomization, 5 participants in the DS1-EI group and 4 participants in the TAU group left during the first 24 months of the study. The reasons for leaving included parents' electing to withdraw their child from the study (n = 1), leaving the institution (n = 6) and extreme behavioral impairments preventing participation in school activities (n = 2). As evidenced by a good retention rate after 24 months (86.1 and 88.9% in the DS1-EI group and TAU group, respectively), the study was well accepted. We had an excellent rate of participation in the study, with only 4.2% of drop-outs attributable to children or parents electing to leave the study. In terms of institutional participation, feasibility was excellent as all sites included 6 to 8 participants. However, despite good implementation of the DS1-EI setting across institutions, some teachers did not understand that assessment of the intervention included administering the annual education achievement test to children from the TAU group. This misinterpretation will be corrected for the 36 months collection, but 24-months educational variables were unfortunately not obtained in all TAU participants. Thus, school variables were not interpretable at 24 months outcome due to missing data.

### Global developmental delay and mental retardation or intellectual disability: conceptualization, evaluation, and etiology [^3e37bb0a]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Global developmental delay and mental retardation or intellectual disability offer challenges to the practitioner at several different levels. Accurate recognition of these most common of subtypes of neurodevelopmental disabilities is a central precondition to their correct evaluation and management. Proper evaluation is a time- and labor-intensive process that emphasizes several different goals. Guidelines now exist to assist the practitioner in selecting the appropriate investigation path to be pursued, and these guidelines should be used to inform the selections of investigations made. Although challenging and time consuming, the evaluation of these children offers many professional rewards and is a necessary first step in a family's adaptation to their child's chronic condition.

Transitioning to adulthood requires a shift from child-centered to adult-centered care, focusing on educational, medical, and community support for individuals with disabilities. Key elements include school-based transition utilizing the Individualized Education Plans, vocational training, and effective health care transitions prioritizing continuity of care and patient autonomy. The importance of mobility and physical activity is highlighted, particularly through adaptive sports, which enhance health and quality of life. Community involvement, social support, and mental and spiritual health are essential for fostering independence and self-esteem. There are critical financial and legal considerations, including guardianship, and resources are provided.

Guidance for pediatricians — Recommended actions include to "Recognize signs and symptoms of child maltreatment in all children and adolescents, including those with disabilities, and understand mandatory, state-specific reporting requirements for child and adult protective services" and to "Use each medical visit as an opportunity to assess family well-being". Clinicians should "Understand that families of children with disabilities benefit from assistance in addressing their child's abilities and needs", "Provide reasonable expectations for parents regarding their children with disabilities and be prepared to offer concrete suggestions about" "how to respond to common developmentally based challenges for the child with a disability", and "Refer families of children with disabilities to available community resources and agencies that provide necessary services designed to aid children with disabilities and their families". The guidance further advises to "Structure discussions about appropriate discipline within well-child visits for the child with a disability", noting that "Parents may be uncertain as to how to deal with discipline, especially for children who are verbal but developmentally delayed, so provide guidance on positive parenting", and to "Consider referring these families to specialists with expertise in parenting skills for children with disabilities". Pediatricians are also urged to "Be actively involved with both educational and medical treatment plans developed for children with disabilities and participate in collaborative team approaches" and to "Advocate at the state and local level for system changes that support at-risk children and those with disabilities and their families".

Lecture presentations may first be improved by thoughtfully reflecting on how learners might best absorb the material, considering the intended audience and focusing on the essential information to be delivered. The addition of slides should augment the presentation, not draw attention away from it. Slides should contain a minimum of verbiage and bullet points. Visual images may enhance the talk. Paying attention to the style of delivery will also aid in getting the message across.

### Providing a primary care medical home for children and youth with cerebral palsy [^dfcbfa15]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Preparation for adulthood in cerebral palsy — legal, educational, and self-management planning are outlined. Studies highlight planning for housing, education, community resources, and insurance, and families of youth with intellectual developmental disorder need additional preparation covering guardianship, conservatorship, supported decision making, special needs trust, and advance directives. Pediatricians report discussing these legal aspects less than 40% of the time, and consultation with a disability lawyer may be helpful. To enhance independence, it is recommended that youth with special health care needs have early life skills training and decision-making opportunities; parents play an essential role, and household chores are associated with better transition readiness. From age 16 years at the latest, a transition plan is part of the individualized education program (IEP) and is individualized with options for education after high school, housing, and job opportunities; one study of adults with CP recommended that self-advocacy goals and activities be included in IEP training. Those with intellectual developmental disorder, particularly with mild impairment, can learn self-management skills, and family members, peers, and mentors may assist with transition to adulthood.

Intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder (ID/IDD) — DSM-5 severity framework and person-first language are specified: The APA revised the criteria for ID/IDD to focus on four levels of severity of impairment based on adaptive functioning across conceptual, social, and practical domains, and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are not used in DSM-5 to define levels of severity. The field and federal law have adopted "person first" language ("a person with intellectual disability"), and clinicians should incorporate this form of reference in their communications with and about individuals with ID/IDD.

### Supporting the health care transition from adolescence to adulthood in the medical home [^e6794f47]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Health care transition (HCT) implementation — national initiatives and specialty customization — is detailed as follows: A growing number of pediatric and adult practices/systems and public health programs in the United States are customizing and implementing the Six Core Elements to establish a structured process for transition to adult care, and in 2016, the Council of Subspecialty Societies of the ACP identified pediatric to adult HCT as a priority initiative as part of its High Value Care Initiative. Several of the adult medical specialty societies created customized transition readiness and self-care assessments and medical summary templates from the Six Core Elements for young adults with selected conditions that include sickle cell disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, epilepsy and other neurologic conditions, and, in conjunction with the Society of Internal Medicine and the Society of Adolescent Health and Medicine, developmental disabilities and physical disabilities. In 2014, the US Maternal and Child Health Bureau articulated HCT as 1 of its top 15 national priorities for state Title V programs, and a total of 32 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to focus on transition and are adopting components of the Six Core Elements approach in activities related to practice and care coordination improvements, health care professional and family and youth education, interagency transition planning and outreach and communications.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: considerations and recommendations for prescribing exercise and designing physical activity programs for people with disabilities [^8e7d0edb]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). High credibility.

ACSM Expert Consensus — exercise prescription and physical activity programming for people with disabilities states that many people with physical or developmental disabilities have physiological responses to exercise that are different from the general population; for many adults with disabilities, significant health benefits may be achieved with less than 150 min wk–1 of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and given inactivity and low activity in this group, the most appropriate starting point may be to focus on moving more. Exercise prescriptions and physical activity programs for persons with disabilities should be individualized to account for impairment/condition influences and individual, environmental, and policy barriers, and health care professionals and exercise professionals must collaborate with patients/participants to design programs that account for individual values, preferences, and needs. Physical activity contexts are described as rife with barriers and practices that reinforce ableism and disability, contributing to systemic inequities that prevent most people with disabilities from participating and deriving health benefits; exercise scientists, health care professionals, and exercise professionals need to understand and raise awareness of these systemic issues and take an active role to eliminate them.

### Development of an ICF core set for adults with cerebral palsy: capturing their perspective on functioning [^cb7434a6]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common developmental motor disorders amongst children, occurring in 2 to 2.5 per 1000 live births. 1, 2, 3 Nowadays, most people with CP are adults due to an increase in life expectancy for this population in the last decades. 4 Known determinants of functioning of people with CP are the level of gross motor functioning, manual ability, speech impairments, and intellectual functioning. 5, 6 Intellectual disability is present in about 49% to 51% of children and adolescents with CP. 7, 8 Intellectual disability limits daily activities, 9 and social participation is more strongly influenced by intellectual disability than by the level of gross motor functioning. 10 Therefore, it is important to specifically examine the relevant aspects of functioning of adults with and without intellectual disability. Despite the increasing attention on adults with CP, research on adults with CP and intellectual disability is scarce. 11

Thus far, studies have shown that CP at adult age results in several impairments and limitations in activities and participation. The large variation and lack of standardization of outcomes of functioning make comparison across studies or countries difficult. 12 Clinical care and research would benefit from a standardized outcome assessment. In this study, we used the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a framework for describing different aspects of functioning, disability, and health in adults with CP. The ICF encompasses the components: body functions, body structures, activities and participation, and environmental and personal factors. 13 In total, the ICF model contains over 1400 categories, which makes its implementation in clinical practice and research challenging. To address this challenge, ICF Core Sets have been developed. ICF Core Sets include the ICF categories that are most relevant for describing functioning of persons with specific health conditions and are available for children with CP; 14 but an ICF Core Set for adults with CP was not available. An early decline of function in adults with CP 15 and a shift to other areas of participation, such as independent living, 16 highlights the importance of developing an ICF Core Set for adults with CP.

Intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder (ID/IDD) etiology — scope and timing are outlined: There are many causes of ID/IDD that reflect complex interactions of genetic predisposition, environmental insults, and developmental vulnerability, and an etiology can be identified for the majority of individuals with severe ID and for a substantial subset of individuals with mild ID. The classification of causes of ID has generally focused on both the type of risk factor and its timing, including prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal events.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^dc55d222]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Additional less restrictive alternatives on the continuum of decision-making — when supported decision-making is unavailable, "individuals with IDD who are 18 years or older and do not need a substitute decision-maker may allow a parent/caregiver to have access to their medical record or to have independent conversations with their physicians". Moreover, "additional, less restrictive alternatives can allow assistance and protection in some aspects of decision-making (often involving financial assets) while maintaining as much autonomy as possible", and "alternatives that may provide the right balance of protection and autonomy while supporting least restrictive environments".

### A call for integrated approaches in digital technology design for aging and disability [^54a0a411]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

We can build on current efforts within individual research groups to understand these needs across the design life cycle by creating mechanisms for collating and synthesizing this work. Synthesis of such knowledge ensures that knowledge does not remain hard to access and is presented in a way that is easily understandable. Importantly, synthesizing this knowledge allows for our digital technology design guidelines and standards to be more effectively based upon empirical evidence. This approach would also allow us to clearly identify what gaps remain and what additional engagement is needed.

Developing Standards and Enforceable Policy

The digital technology design standards developed to integrate the diverse needs of older adult and disabled communities can thus offer a framework for ensuring their inclusion in society, but only if those standards are effectively codified and enforced through policy and law. It will be essential, as the nature of our digital technologies change to iteratively develop design guidance through the aforementioned community engagement mechanisms. Thus, standards, too, should be iteratively reassessed and revised to remain relevant in the current digital technology landscape.

We acknowledge that it is not straight forward to develop standards that are comprehensive, yet specific enough to address the needs of all people. However, we believe the answer lies in developing standards of different kinds and with sufficient iteration and feedback mechanisms. For example, standards may include both recommendations for specific functionalities of digital technologies, and also recommendations for effectively engaging community in the design process. We look to the ways in which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has implemented usability testing requirements for medical devices to minimize potential use errors and resulting harm as a model for how to develop standards (and translate those standards into policy) in ways that prioritize safety without hindering innovation.

### Advocacy and collaborative health care for justice-involved youth [^3d94abd2]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Educational needs — justice-involved youth show substantial unmet schooling needs and disability-related rights: The SYRP found that 24% of youth reported they were not enrolled in school at the time they entered custody, 61% had been expelled or suspended, and 48% reported being below the level expected for their age, and learning disabilities are more common among youth in custody with reported rates as high as 30%. Despite increased educational need, available data suggest confined youth receive inadequate educational support, with a 2016 US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights report finding programming hours and days vary widely, teachers in confinement facilities are more likely to be absent, and essential math and science courses are less likely to be offered; federal agencies developed guiding principles for high-quality education in juvenile justice secure settings. Youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities are overrepresented, with an estimated national average prevalence in confined youth of 33%; these confined youth have the same rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act as nonconfined youth and are entitled to individualized education programs and special education services, and national organizations provide recommendations to prevent involvement and improve special education delivery.

### The individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA) for children with special educational needs [^5a9abea5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Sharing relevant information with EI or school personnel — authorization and communication: EI programs and schools rely on interactions with health care providers to plan appropriate interventions and educational environments, and parents and guardians usually share medical and mental health information with EI programs and schools. Health care providers may share a patient's protected health information relevant to the child's education program with school personnel only after securing appropriate authorization to disclose from the patient's parent or legal representative or guardian, and youth sometimes choose to share health information with school personnel; when appropriate, the youth or family should be consulted around information sharing, particularly when the information is sensitive in nature.

### Engaging ethnically diverse families of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities: a systematic review [^e5267cac]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Culture is a critical component of family engagement, particularly for ethnically diverse children with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their family members. Ethnically diverse families of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities often encounter challenges when attempting to access special education and social services. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to explore the ways cultural demographics impact family engagement and types of professional strategies that contribute to increased engagement for ethnically diverse family members of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of the literature using three databases and studies were published during a 22-year period.

Results

Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for our systematic review of literature. Studies included ethnically diverse family members from 11 different countries. Studies included children with intellectual and developmental delays between 1 to 21years of age. Our findings highlight cross-cultural factors that influence family engagement.

Conclusions

Our findings emphasize the importance of developing professionals who understand the expectations, assumptions, and values of ethnically diverse families which can enhance outcomes for family members across various contexts.

### Pilot feasibility study examining a structured self-management diabetes education programme, DESMOND-ID, targeting hbAin adults with intellectual disabilities [^36ac4d5c]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To report on the outcomes of a pilot feasibility study of a structured self-management diabetes education programme targeting HbA 1c.

Methods

We conducted a two-arm, individually randomized, pilot superiority trial for adults with intellectual disability and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 66 adults with disabilities across the UK met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 39 agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to either the DESMOND-ID programme (n = 19) or a control group (n = 20). The programme consisted of seven weekly educational sessions. The primary outcome was HbA 1c level, and secondary outcomes included BMI, diabetes illness perceptions, severity of diabetes, quality of life, and attendance rates.

Results

This study found that the DESMOND-ID programme was feasible to deliver. With reasonable adjustments, the participants could be recruited successfully, and could provide consent, complete the outcome measures, be randomized to the groups and attend most of the sessions, with minimal loss to follow-up. The fixed-effects model, the interaction between occasion (time) and condition, showed statistically significant results (0.05 level) for HbA 1c; however, the CI was large.

Conclusion

This is the first published study to adapt and pilot a national structured self-management diabetes education programme for adults with intellectual disability. This study shows it is possible to identify, recruit, consent and randomize adults with intellectual disabilities to an intervention or control group. Internationally, the results of this pilot are promising, demonstrating that a multi-session education programme is acceptable and feasible to deliver. Its effectiveness should be further tested in an adequately powered trial.

### Development of an ICF core set for adults with cerebral palsy: capturing their perspective on functioning [^68233646]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine the most relevant aspects of functioning of adults with cerebral palsy (CP) from their perspective, in order to develop an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for adults with CP.

Method

We conducted six focus group discussions with adults with CP without intellectual disability and seven interviews with adults with CP with intellectual disability and caregivers, addressing all ICF components. Meaningful concepts were identified from verbatim transcripts and linked to ICF categories by two independent researchers.

Results

In total, 31 adults with CP without intellectual disability (mean [SD] age 46y 1mo [14y 1mo]; 20 females, 11 males; Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] levels I–IV) and seven adults with CP and intellectual disability (mean [SD] age 25y 8mo [6y 8mo]; four females, three males; GMFCS levels III–V) participated. We identified 132 unique second‐level categories: 47 body functions, seven body structures, 43 activities and participation, and 35 environmental factors. The most frequently mentioned categories were emotional function, pain, muscle tone function, support of family, products and technology, and health services.

Interpretation

Adults with CP experienced problems in a broad range of body functions and activities and indicated the importance of environmental factors for functioning. The identified categories will be added to the list of candidate items to reach consensus on an ICF Core Set for adults with CP.

What this paper adds

Including the lived experience is crucial for fully understanding functioning of adults with cerebral palsy (CP).
Adults with CP perceive environmental factors as essential elements for everyday functioning.
Adults with intellectual disability should be considered as a group with specific problems.

### Randomized controlled feasibility trial of supported self-management in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an intellectual disability: OK diabetes [^9bed24a9]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Supported self‐management

The intervention was based on modifying existing approaches to supported self‐management, with adjustments made to respond to barriers to self‐care in people with an intellectual disability. It emphasized realistic goal setting, identifying resources and barriers likely to influence success in reaching goals, and regular self‐monitoring of goal attainment. For the 'supported' element we chose to use face‐to‐face contact and employed two diabetes specialist nurses from the local diabetes service, with no prior experience in learning disability or involvement in research concerning trials of complex interventions.

We started with three principles in deciding the format and content of supported self‐management. First the intervention should respond to known barriers to self‐management reported by people with a disability, including practical problems such as transport, likely attrition through drop‐out when multiple attendances are expected, and inability to accommodate the presence of a supporter. Second, the format of the intervention should be likely to encourage self‐maintained change beyond an early supported element; in our target population this meant especially that the intervention should involve supporters involved with any aspect of lifestyle (shopping, food choice, physical activity, medication monitoring and so on) relevant to diabetes. Third, the intervention should be designed to be readily integrated into usual healthcare provision in the National Health Service, to ensure sustainability.

Based on all the advice we received from those working with our target group, we wanted to give particular salience to: practical aspects of self‐care; use of simple (accessible) written materials and charts; supportive contact both with a professional and with a supporter if one could be identified; use of practical goal setting and self‐monitoring.

By contrast we decided that less helpful aspects would be education of a more theoretical sort about the nature of diabetes, food values and so on; however, all participants received factual information about managing their diabetes in a booklet as part of the treatment as usual arm of the randomized controlled trial. We did not include information technology‐based interventions (e.g. web‐, DVD‐, mobile phone‐based interventions), because these are usually not readily accessible by our participants. Finally, we decided against group‐based interventions as attendance is typically poor and meeting the specific individual needs arising in a heterogeneous population is harder in such settings.

### Providing a primary care medical home for children and youth with cerebral palsy [^1794827d]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) — sexual abuse risk, confidentiality, screening, education, and vaccination: Youth with physical and developmental disabilities are at higher risk of sexual abuse, with "a 2 to 10 times higher odds of experiencing sexual abuse compared with the overall population". For adolescents with CP and typical intelligence or mild intellectual developmental disorder, "privacy and confidentiality during the examination is indicated", and pediatricians should be aware of behavioral symptoms suggestive of abuse to "investigate or refer for investigation". As with all adolescents, sexually transmitted infection screening "is recommended for those who are sexually active, have symptoms, or have risk factors", and sex education "is essential for all youth and should not be ignored in youth with CP", including IEP-based content modified to abilities with guidance on protection and abuse prevention. Vaccination against human papillomavirus "is recommended for all youth, including youth with CP", with prevention particularly important because of likely sexual activity, increased sexual abuse rates, and screening barriers.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^cd4b8f76]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Historical review — terminology for individuals with intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder has evolved with major milestones: in 1961 the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) introduced "mental retardation"; in 1992 the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) changed the term to "intellectual disability", emphasizing a disability construct in which environmental demands and supports shape functioning; and in 2013 the DSM-5 revised the diagnostic term to "intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)" with a focus on the developmental disorder construct in keeping with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).

### The hospitalized adolescent [^d1f231fd]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Hospitalized adolescent — recommendations for inpatient care include the following: Hospital administrations, along with clinicians experienced in caring for adolescents, should assist in the design of hospital settings and in the development and implementation of policies and guidelines for inpatient adolescents. Hospitalist training should include modules on adolescent health and wellness. Researchers should aggregate demographic data to describe new and ongoing trends in adolescent hospitalizations and identify specific areas of focus to improve patient care and physician/staff training. Care of adolescents in the hospital setting should be centered around confidentiality, including knowledge of state confidentiality laws regarding adolescents, privacy, dignity, and respect; for those with intellectual or developmental disabilities, care should be centered around their ability to participate in their care and assent to decisions. Connecting adolescents to their primary care medical home for follow-up and ongoing care is an essential part of hospital discharge. Ongoing antiracist, antimicroaggression/implicit bias training of physicians and other adolescent hospital caregivers is imperative. Typical adolescent activities, including educational, recreational, and visitation needs during hospitalization, should continue as much as possible. Personnel caring for adolescents, including those in foster or kinship care, have a responsibility to understand the moral, ethical, legal, and developmental framework of adolescent patients' medical decision-making, consent, assent, and refusal of treatment. Transition, when appropriate, from pediatric to adult-oriented providers and hospitals should occur through standardized mechanisms while inpatient, including a readiness checklist.

### Randomized controlled feasibility trial of supported self-management in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an intellectual disability: OK diabetes [^de48848e]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The final intervention had four standardized components with associated materials. How they were delivered depended on participant and supporter characteristics and preferences.

Establishing the participant's daily routines and lifestyle. Establishing the participant's daily routines and lifestyle included current diet and activity routines, participation in daytime social activities or work, shopping and food preparation, current self‐reported health and self‐management. The main aim of this component was to identify the social and personal influences in the life of the person with diabetes that would limit their ability to self‐manage, or that might be mobilized as a resource in supporting self‐management.
Identifying all supporters and helpers and their roles. Identifying all supporters and helpers and their roles led to key supporters and other helpers being given written information about the project and if they agreed to support a goal set by the participant they were given a written reminder of their role. The main aim was to identify people who might be a useful resource in supporting self‐management, and to ensure any changes were embedded in the social network for longer‐term maintenance of change.
Setting realistic goals for change. In setting realistic goals for change the main aim was to avoid prescribing change in the way of good dietary practice or other lifestyle change, but to support goals suggested by the person with diabetes that were specific, simple and achievable given the person's current routines and social support, and consonant with their willingness to make change. The intention was to encourage engagement in a population usually thought of as having little agency, and to introduce the idea of selectable elements in a repertoire of self‐management options.
Monitoring progress against agreed upon goals. To allow monitoring of progress against agreed upon goals we devised a simple system that did not depend on high levels of functional literacy, using tear‐off calendar sheets on which participants noted goal attainment in a Yes/No format. The main aim was to encourage active participation in an activity that is a core feature of self‐management.

### Considerations for alternative decision-making when transitioning to adulthood for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities: policy statement [^36524d9f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — transition to adulthood for youth with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) states that patient- and family-centered, integrated care is warranted during this period, and support teams (including the youth, caregivers, teachers, and pediatricians) should engage in transition planning, ideally starting between 12 and 14 years of age, to build capacity for independent decision-making; care teams should consider the varied levels of alternative decision-making support, which may include supported decision-making, medical proxy decision-making, power of attorney, and/or establishment of legal guardianship arrangements; if independent decision-making is not appropriate, the goal for youth with IDD should be the least restrictive alternative while preserving human rights and human dignity and promoting their autonomy; pediatricians can support by actively engaging the youth in care decisions, supporting needs for augmentative communication, fostering expression of preferences and understanding of care decisions, and linking them to resources such as the medical-legal partnership model.
