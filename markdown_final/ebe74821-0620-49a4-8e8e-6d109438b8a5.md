## Question

What is white discharge from vagina and smells bad

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what white, malodorous vaginal discharge could indicate, including differential diagnosis, diagnostic approach, and management, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key descriptors and what they imply pathophysiologically. Then, I should build a prioritized differential diagnosis and map each option to its classic features. Next, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including point-of-care tests and when to use molecular testing. After that, I need to consider special populations and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize evidence-based treatment options and highlight pitfalls and follow-up needs, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go [^113dmELK] [^1168cCT1].

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the descriptors: white discharge with a bad smell. White discharge alone can be physiologic or pathologic, but the addition of a malodor strongly pushes me toward infectious etiologies, particularly bacterial vaginosis, and also raises concern for trichomoniasis, aerobic vaginitis, or less commonly foreign body or fistula, so I should not jump to conclusions without correlating with pH, microscopy, and risk factors [^1168cCT1] [^114ubumW] [^114Vnx7S] [^111xDv8C].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis: bacterial vaginosis. BV typically presents with thin, homogeneous, grayish-white discharge and a fishy amine odor, often with minimal irritation, elevated vaginal pH above 4.5, and clue cells on microscopy; the whiff test with KOH is classically positive, and BV accounts for roughly 40–50% of symptomatic vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women, though many women with BV are asymptomatic, so I should confirm objectively rather than rely on symptoms alone [^1152aQWC] [^112C9UWw] [^113s9HPS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — trichomoniasis can mimic or coexist with BV and must be considered. Trichomonas vaginalis often causes a frothy, yellow-green discharge with a strong odor and may show motile organisms on saline wet mount, but microscopy has only about 50–70% sensitivity, so NAAT is preferred for diagnosis; importantly, TV is sexually transmitted and requires partner treatment to prevent reinfection [^1168cCT1] [^113YSL9K].

> Next, I should review aerobic vaginitis as a key alternative. AV tends to produce purulent yellow or yellow-green discharge with a rotten odor, marked erythema, and significant inflammation on microscopy with parabasal cells and abundant PMNs; unlike BV, AV reflects aerobic overgrowth and epithelial damage, so management differs and mislabeling as BV can worsen symptoms [^113RH5n8] [^114ubumW].

> But wait, what if the "white" discharge is actually thick and curdy with pruritus? That pattern points toward vulvovaginal candidiasis, which is usually odorless or mildly yeasty rather than truly foul; however, patients may misreport odor, so I should double-check with KOH microscopy for hyphae or blastoconidia and consider culture if recurrent or refractory to distinguish Candida albicans from non-albicans species that alter therapy [^1168cCT1] [^112C9UWw].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook noninfectious and structural causes when the story does not fit. Foreign bodies, particularly in children, can cause persistent malodorous discharge; pessaries and retained surgical materials can do the same in adults; and rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas present with fecal or urinary leakage and chronic foul odor — these entities require targeted examination and imaging rather than repeated antibiotics [^117J5Kv8] [^111xDv8C] [^117FLYuJ].

> Let me first confirm the initial diagnostic approach. ACOG and CDC recommend measuring vaginal pH, performing a KOH whiff test, and microscopy of saline and KOH preparations to assess for clue cells, motile trichomonads, and yeast forms; however, I should verify the limitations — wet mount sensitivity is poor, especially for TV and coinfections, so negative microscopy does not exclude disease and should prompt NAAT when available [^113t5FRM] [^1168cCT1] [^112LEkkc].

> Wait, I should verify the performance of clinical criteria. Amsel criteria for BV require three of four findings: homogeneous discharge, pH > 4.5, positive whiff test, and clue cells; while specific, sensitivity is modest and operator-dependent, and many clinics omit microscopy, leading to misdiagnosis; thus, molecular panels or targeted NAATs improve accuracy and reduce inappropriate treatment and return visits [^1152aQWC] [^113LbkQT] [^112LEkkc].

> I will now examine when to escalate to molecular testing. If microscopy is unavailable or negative despite persistent symptoms, or if coinfection is suspected, NAAT panels for BV, TV, and Candida provide higher sensitivity and can clarify mixed infections; in community practice, empiric treatment without objective testing leads to frequent mismanagement and more return visits, so I should advocate for testing when feasible [^1168cCT1] [^113LbkQT] [^112LEkkc].

> Let me consider special populations and red flags. In adolescents, ensure confidential sexual history and consider foreign body; in pregnancy, BV and TV increase risks of preterm birth and warrant treatment even if asymptomatic in some contexts; in postmenopausal patients, atrophic vaginitis is common, but a foul odor with purulent discharge should prompt evaluation for AV or even malignancy; and in children, any malodorous discharge mandates a careful search for a foreign body [^114Vnx7S] [^112UAP5S] [^113YSL9K] [^116qqVPc] [^111eWgRs] [^112C9UWw].

> Hold on, I should verify treatment choices and avoid premature closure. For BV, first-line options include oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, intravaginal metronidazole gel, or intravaginal clindamycin; single-dose clindamycin phosphate 2% gel is FDA-approved and noninferior in trials, and dequalinium chloride is a validated nonantibiotic alternative with biofilm activity; recurrence is common, so consider suppressive strategies and address biofilm biology in refractory cases [^1168cCT1] [^11634wJN] [^116UJMZk] [^113yDc2c].

> For trichomoniasis, I should confirm that both the patient and sexual partners receive metronidazole or tinidazole, as reinfection is otherwise likely; NAAT is the diagnostic test of choice when available, and I should treat even if the partner is asymptomatic, given the high carriage and transmission rates [^1168cCT1] [^113YSL9K].

> For aerobic vaginitis, I need to check that therapy targets aerobic pathogens and epithelial inflammation; topical clindamycin or fluoroquinolone therapy guided by culture, with consideration of short-course corticosteroids for severe inflammation, is reasonable, and I should avoid assuming BV in the face of purulence and marked erythema [^114ubumW].

> For vulvovaginal candidiasis, let me reconsider species-specific therapy. Uncomplicated C. albicans responds to topical azoles or single-dose oral fluconazole, whereas non-albicans species may require culture-directed therapy and vaginal boric acid for recalcitrant cases; I should confirm with microscopy or culture before labeling recurrent symptoms as "yeast" [^112C9UWw] [^1168cCT1].

> I should double-check the pitfalls of empiric treatment. Community studies show that nearly half of symptomatic women receive inappropriate prescriptions when testing is omitted, and empiric therapy without a confirmed diagnosis increases return visits; therefore, even when rapid testing is limited, prioritizing pH, whiff, and microscopy, and defaulting to NAAT when available, improves care and reduces recurrence [^113LbkQT] [^115svfSR] [^1168cCT1].

> Next, I should review follow-up and prevention. Counsel on avoidance of douching, consider probiotics with Lactobacillus crispatus for recurrent BV, and arrange test-of-cure only for persistent symptoms or suspected treatment failure; for TV, ensure partner treatment and abstinence from sex until both parties complete therapy to prevent ping-pong reinfection [^1168cCT1] [^1166aRMr].

> In summary, white, malodorous discharge most often reflects BV, but trichomoniasis, aerobic vaginitis, candidiasis, and structural causes must be differentiated with pH, whiff test, microscopy, and NAAT when needed; accurate diagnosis averts misdirected therapy and repeated visits, and guideline-concordant treatment tailored to the etiology yields the best outcomes [^112C9UWw] [^1168cCT1] [^112LEkkc].

White, malodorous vaginal discharge most often indicates **bacterial vaginosis (BV)** [^112UAP5S], characterized by a thin, gray-white discharge with a fishy odor and elevated pH (> 4.5) [^1152aQWC]. Other causes include **trichomoniasis** (frothy, yellow-green, foul-smelling discharge) [^114Gj5f3], **aerobic vaginitis** (purulent, foul-smelling discharge with vaginal redness) [^113RH5n8], and **foreign body** (persistent foul-smelling discharge, especially in children) [^114Vnx7S]. Diagnosis relies on **Amsel criteria** [^117UifPn] or **Nugent score** [^1152aQWC] for BV, NAAT for trichomoniasis [^1168cCT1], and clinical assessment for foreign body or AV [^113RH5n8] [^113SaLY3]. Treatment is pathogen-specific: **metronidazole or clindamycin** for BV [^112de675], **metronidazole or tinidazole** for trichomoniasis [^1168cCT1], and removal of the foreign body with antibiotics for AV [^116mWLsn]. Persistent or recurrent discharge warrants further evaluation for resistant organisms, biofilm, or structural lesions [^116UJMZk] [^116nKm9g].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a thorough **history** (onset, duration, sexual history, hygiene, prior treatments) [^115QbQcF] and a focused **pelvic examination** assessing discharge characteristics and signs of inflammation [^113LrPTr].

---

### Laboratory testing

- **pH testing**: pH > 4.5 suggests BV or trichomoniasis [^1168cCT1].
- **Whiff test**: Fishy odor after adding KOH suggests BV [^117UifPn].
- **Microscopy**: Identify clue cells (BV), motile trichomonads, or fungal elements [^1168cCT1].
- **NAAT**: Highly sensitive for trichomoniasis and BV [^112LEkkc].
- **Culture**: Useful for recurrent or complicated infections [^111x3dZw].

---

## Treatment options

### Bacterial vaginosis

First-line treatments include **metronidazole** 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or **clindamycin** 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^111x3dZw]. Alternative options include **metronidazole gel** 0.75% intravaginally nightly for 5 days or **clindamycin** 2% intravaginally nightly for 7 days [^notfound].

---

### Trichomoniasis

Treat with **metronidazole** 2 g orally as a single dose or **tinidazole** 2 g orally as a single dose, and ensure **partner treatment** to prevent reinfection [^112C9UWw].

---

### Aerobic vaginitis

Treat with **broad-spectrum antibiotics** such as fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams, and add **topical estrogen** if atrophic changes are present [^111x3dZw].

---

### Foreign body

Remove the foreign body and administer **empiric antibiotics** to prevent secondary infection [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Increased risk with BV and trichomoniasis [^notfound].
- **Infertility**: Associated with chronic infections and PID [^notfound].
- **Adverse pregnancy outcomes**: Preterm birth, miscarriage, and postpartum endometritis [^111aLKtC].
- **Increased HIV risk**: Higher susceptibility with BV and trichomoniasis [^1176CAmG].

---

## Preventive measures and hygiene practices

- **Safe sex**: Consistent condom use [^notfound].
- **Avoid douching**: Prevents disruption of normal vaginal flora [^112UAP5S].
- **Regular hygiene**: Gentle cleansing with water; avoid irritants [^117J5Kv8].
- **Prompt treatment**: Early intervention for infections [^113Qyic3].

---

White, malodorous vaginal discharge most commonly reflects **BV**, but trichomoniasis, AV, and foreign body must be considered. Accurate diagnosis using **Amsel criteria**, **microscopy**, or **NAAT** enables targeted therapy and reduces complications [^112UAP5S] [^111x3dZw] [^113RH5n8] [^11647K2h] [^117UifPn] [^112C9UWw] [^112LEkkc].

### Genital malodor in women: a modern reappraisal [^111aU1i5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Genital malodor is a common distressing complaint that brings a woman to her physician's office. Vaginal infections, primarily bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, still remain the commonest causes and are relatively easy to diagnose and treat. However, in approximately one third of women who present with malodor, no cause is identified. Although data on the management of vaginal discharge are extensive, the management of genital odor beyond common vaginal infections remains poorly studied. This presents a frustrating situation for both the patient and her physician. Often, patients resort to home remedies and over-the-counter preparations, which, while providing short-term relief for some women, almost never address the cause and, in some cases, can exacerbate symptoms. In this review, we have attempted to consolidate the known and documented causes of genital malodor including the nonvaginal causes and provide case studies that will help clinicians understand the possible settings for the various causes. We also provide an algorithm for the management of this symptom beyond vaginal infections.

### Management of vaginitis [^111x3dZw]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Common infectious forms of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Vaginitis also can occur because of atrophic changes. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by proliferation of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. The diagnosis is based primarily on the Amsel criteria (milky discharge, pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells in a wet-mount preparation). The standard treatment is oral metronidazole in a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for seven days. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be difficult to diagnose because characteristic signs and symptoms (thick, white discharge, dysuria, vulvovaginal pruritus and swelling) are not specific for the infection. Diagnosis should rely on microscopic examination of a sample from the lateral vaginal wall (10 to 20 percent potassium hydroxide preparation). Cultures are helpful in women with recurrent or complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, because species other than Candida albicans (e.g. Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis) may be present. Topical azole and oral fluconazole are equally efficacious in the management of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, but a more extensive regimen may be required for complicated infections. Trichomoniasis may cause a foul-smelling, frothy discharge and, in most affected women, vaginal inflammatory changes. Culture and DNA probe testing are useful in diagnosing the infection; examinations of wet-mount preparations have a high false-negative rate. The standard treatment for trichomoniasis is a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. Atrophic vaginitis results from estrogen deficiency. Treatment with topical estrogen is effective.

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^114PMNCc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal symptoms account for more than 10 million physician visits in the United States annually, making them a leading cause of medical consultations among women. Since vaginal symptoms such as vaginal discharge, odour, itching and burning can be indicative of a variety of bacterial or fungal infections for which pharmacological treatment is pathogen-specific, accurately identifying the cause of presenting symptoms is crucial in the clinical assessment process. The clinical and laboratory methods commonly used to detect pathogens responsible for vaginal symptoms in women include a visual assessment of vaginal discharge by the treating physician, wet prep microscopy, urine culture or the collection of vaginal swabs for subsequent molecular testing; each method has its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of results turnaround time, accuracy, costs, and availability.

Determining symptom aetiology based on a clinical workup is notoriously inaccurate given the difficulty with microscopy (which is no longer available in many settings), the lack of specificity of the appearance of discharge and the high frequency of co-infections. Clinical diagnosis has also been hampered by SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic as many patients, even those with symptoms, were not undergoing full pelvic examinations with visualisation of the cervix. This rendered the already difficult task of separating vaginitis from cervicitis as a cause of discharge nearly impossible. Given these challenges, laboratory diagnostics are needed to fully understand the pathogens that may be present in these patients.

### Aerobic vaginitis in the third trimester and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^113RH5n8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2002, the term "aerobic vaginitis" (AV) was first identified by Donders et al. AV is described as a depletion of the Lactobacillus microbiota and an increase in aerobic bacteria derived mainly from the gastrointestinal tract, accompanied by inflammatory markers and deficient epithelial maturation (Table 1). AV is characterized by the presence of several aerobic and facultative bacteria, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical presentation includes purulent homogenous discharge (yellow or yellow-green), foul-smelling rotten odor, introital and vaginal redness (in case of severe AV, also ecchymotic bleeding points and erosions), stinging and burning sensations, and dyspareunia. Symptoms can be present for a long period of time and fluctuate in terms of severity.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^111xDv8C]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Manifestations

Regardless of type, all VF cause distressing symptoms including persistent vaginitis despite treatment, dyspareunia, painful perineal dermatitis and excoriation. Entero-VF are heralded by foul-smelling enteral or faecal discharge through the vagina. Faecal incontinence may develop secondary to associated loss of anal sphincter function.

The characteristic symptom of urinary VF is continual leakage of urine from the vagina and vulvar irritation. In recently operated patients, specific symptoms of VF are often masked by common post-operative problems such as abdominal and flank pain, hematuria, worsening renal function, fever and paralytic ileus. Not unusually, iatrogenic damage to the urinary tract is heralded by imaging detection of fluid collections representing urinoma. Biochemical assay of discharge fluid for creatinine levels and intravesical injection of methylene blue dye are helpful to confirm the presence of the VF.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^113LrPTr]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using some combination of physical examination, pH, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

Data Sources

Using a structured literature review, we abstracted information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures. We chose published (1966 to April 2003) articles that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under the combined search terms of diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

Study Selection

Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they would provide diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

Data Extraction

All 3 authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

Data Synthesis

Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to distinguish confidently between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0.18 [95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.70] to 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87]) and lack of perceived odor makes bacterial vaginosis unlikely (LR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.51]). Similarly, physical examination signs are limited in their diagnostic power. The presence of inflammatory signs is associated with candidiasis (range of LRs, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.8] to 8.4 [95% CI, 2.3–31]). Presence of a "high cheese" odor on examination is predictive of bacterial vaginosis (LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1–4.7]) while lack of odor is associated with candidiasis (LR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.4–5.0]). Office laboratory tests, particularly microscopy of vaginal discharge, are the most useful way of diagnosing these 3 conditions.

Conclusions

The cause of vaginal complaints may be easily diagnosed when typical findings appear in microscopy. However, the poor performance of individual symptoms, signs, and office laboratory tests often makes it problematic to identify the cause of vaginal symptoms.

### Urinary tract infection as a single presenting sign of multiple vaginal foreign bodies: case report and review of the literature [^113SaLY3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal foreign bodies in children usually present with foul-smelling discharge and/or vaginal bleeding. Rarely, these basic clinical diagnostic signs are not present.

Case

We report on a 5(1/2)-year-old girl with recurrent lower urinary tract infection as the sole presentation of multiple vaginal foreign bodies. Ultrasound of the lower urinary tract was inconclusive, and cystography indicated for recurrent urinary tract infections was declined by the patient in an outpatient setting. Cystography under general anesthesia raised the suspicion of foreign vaginal objects, and the definitive diagnosis was made by vaginoscopy. The relevant literature covering this subject is reviewed.

Conclusion

High level of suspicion and strict basic diagnostic protocol are the most important steps for a timely diagnosis of this condition.

### Postpartum endometritis caused by herpes and cytomegaloviruses [^113yqHLH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum endometritis is usually a polymicrobial infection caused by organisms that are part of the normal vaginal flora. A pathologically confirmed case of postpartum endometritis secondary to herpes and cytomegalovirus in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patient is reported.

Case

A 29-year-old, HIV-positive woman presented 6 days postpartum with abdominal pain and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed retained products of conception. Dilation and evacuation was performed, and antibiotics were started. Despite adequate antibiotics and laparoscopic drainage of a pelvic collection, fevers and pain continued. A total abdominal hysterectomy, salpingectomy, and appendectomy were performed. Pathology reported herpes and cytomegalovirus infection of the uterus.

Conclusion

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus need to be considered as a potential cause of postpartum endometritis. When antibiotic therapy fails, an antiviral regimen should be considered.

### Rectorrhagia and vaginal discharge caused by a vaginal foreign body – a case report and review of literature [^116mWLsn]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old girl was taken to an outpatient clinic of surgery suffering from rectorrhagia and purulent, smelly vaginal discharge. Colonoscopy and biopsy were done before referring and sulfasalazine regime was administrated for probable colitis. The surgeon performed a rigid rectosigmoidoscopy under general anesthesia and no positive evidence was found. Having examined the hymen, it was found to be intact but a purulent discharge was observed. After drying the discharge, a black foreign body was seen in the bottom of the vagina and brought out by a fine forceps. It was a toy's wheel. The patient and her mother both denied foreign body abusing history. It was recommended she go for a psychological consultation. Generally speaking, all young patients suffering from vaginal or rectal bleeding with or without discharge should have their vagina checked for a foreign body. What is recommended in such cases is to undergo sonography or plain radiography before considering invasive or non-invasive procedures for evaluating anal and sigmoid abnormalities. Last but not least, a vaginal irrigation, precise examination of hymen, and posterior fossa can prove very useful for detecting simple vaginal bodies that can lead to various vaginal, rectal and abdominal complications.

### Pelvic organ myiasis [^113Y7e3R]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Myiasis is infestation with dipterous larvae, which feed on the host's dead or living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food.

Case

A 76-year-old, multiparous woman presented at a tertiary care hospital in India with vaginal discharge and itching for 3 weeks. The patient had a health care attendant who apparently failed to notice the problems she was experiencing. Pelvic examination revealed grade 2 uterine prolapse. Vaginal discharge was purulent, foul smelling, and contained several 8–10-mm white maggots of Musca domestica (housefly). Turpentine oil was instilled locally, and maggots were removed manually. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. Maggot removal was repeated weekly for 3 weeks until no further maggots were present. Hysteroscopy was normal. The prolapsed uterus was replaced in its anatomic position with vaginal pessary.

Conclusion

Decreased physical and mental capabilities due to old age and poor care by health providers can lead to maggot infestation of prolapsed pelvic organs.

### Longstanding presence of a vaginal foreign body (battery): severe stenosis in a 13-year-old girl [^114on5vF]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In recurrent/unresponsive vaginal discharge a vaginal foreign body should be considered.

Case

We present the case of a 13-year-old girl who suffered from a foul-smelling dark brownish and malodorous vaginal discharge since the age of 7 years. When the girl was 11 years old, a foreign body was discovered on ultrasound imaging; removal by colposcopy failed, because of the complete battery inclusion in the posterior vaginal wall. Two years later, at our institution, radiological images yielded the general position of the foreign body; colposcopy showed complete vaginal stenosis. Forced dilatation allowed surgical removal of the battery which was embedded in the vaginal fundal wall.

Summary and Conclusion

Early removal of foreign objects prevents ulceration, necrosis, stenosis, perforations, and late serious sequelae such as pelvic inflammation and infertility.

### Pessary treatment for pelvic organ prolapse and health-related quality of life: a review [^116m5PX2]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Complications and discomfort

The most common side effects of pessary use are a foul smell, vaginal discharge, bleeding, pain and constipation. A recent study reported that 56% of women wearing a pessary reported one of these side effects. Changing a pessary at frequent intervals could prevent this vaginal irritation. Therefore, it is helpful if the patient is willing and able to remove, clean and replace the pessary herself.

Rarely, pessaries cause major urinary, rectal and genital complications such as fistula, faecal impaction, hydronephrosis and urosepsis. These rare complications are almost exclusively related to a long period of use and negligence of care. With regular follow-up, the majority of pessary complications can be avoided and kept to a minimum.

### Structural racism and adverse pregnancy outcomes through the lens of the maternal microbiome [^115NbD9e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

GUT AND VAGINAL MICROBIOMES OF PREGNANCY

The intestinal microbiome plays many critical roles in health maintenance under normal conditions. A highly diverse and stable gut microbiome helps support intestinal barrier function (which serves as a critical barrier to pathogenic microbes and allergens) and produces metabolites that maintain an anti-inflammatory systemic milieu via immune modulation, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). – The intestinal microbiome changes over the course of pregnancy and converges on a profile characterized by less diversity (bacterial richness or abundance) that more closely resembles one associated with metabolic syndrome. Koren et alhighlighted, that between the first and third trimesters, the alpha diversity (within-subject) of stool samples decreases and beta diversity (between subjects) increases. These changes suggest that shifts in the gut microbiome are part of physiologic adaptations to pregnancy and that further aberrations (for example, from poor diet or obesity) may also be implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, PTB, and gestational diabetes.

Although increased diversity is important for a healthy intestinal microbiome, low diversity is more favorable in the vaginal environment. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized as a dysbiosis with anaerobic overgrowth and absence of protective Lactobacilli, typically associated with altered vaginal discharge and foul-smelling odor. Up to one third of reproductive aged women will experience BV, with Black or Hispanic women disproportionately affected. Bacterial vaginosis has well-described associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including PTB. Studies that evaluated vaginal communities of nonpregnant women through 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and grouped them by predominant organism "community state types"have shown that Black and Hispanic women are more likely to have anaerobe-dominant community state types than White women. Although the vaginal microbiome of pregnant women converges on Lactobacillus dominance, women with an early pregnancy vaginal community state type that is anaerobe-dominant appear to have a higher risk of spontaneous PTB. – In the sections below, we will explore structural, environmental and psychosocial health indicators that may be modulating maternal microbiomes as a means of affecting pregnancy outcomes.

### The diagnosis and treatment of infectious vaginitis [^115KpjM6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the vagina as a result of infectious agents is very common, both as an overgrowth of normal or common colonizers, or as a frank infection. The most common causes of infectious vaginitis are yeast, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasites. Infections of the vagina produce an increase in vaginal secretion, vulvar symptoms of itching or irritation from contact with irritating vaginal fluid, and sometimes odor. A careful microscopic examination of vaginal secretions generally yields the correct diagnosis, but atypical or recalcitrant disease deserves a confirmatory culture, as noninfectious inflammatory processes can produce similar symptoms.

### Vaginal foreign body presenting as bleeding with defecation in a child [^111eWgRs]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Symptoms secondary to a vaginal foreign body are responsible for approximately 4% of pediatric gynecologic outpatient visits.(1) The classic symptom is vaginal bleeding, but vaginal discharge, foul odor, irritation, abdominal pain, and hematuria have been described. We are reporting a case of a microscopic vaginal foreign body presenting as hematochezia in a preadolescent girl. This case is unique in that the patient presented with bleeding with defecation, without vaginal bleeding. Vaginal foreign bodies can present with diverse symptomatology. Physicians should consider the diagnosis of vaginal foreign body when presented with a young female patient with unexplained hematochezia.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1168cCT1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e. > 4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e. epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Herlyn-werner-wunderlich syndrome – timely diagnosis is important to preserve fertility [^111kSY8k]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome is an urogenital malformation with uterus didelphys and obstructed hemivagina with ipsilateral renal agenesis. Most of these patients present after the onset of menstruation. We describe two cases diagnosed too late to prevent the complications.

Case

The first patient presented with acute abdomen one year after the onset of menstruation and had salpingectomy due to pyosalpinx. The blind hemivagina was not recognized and she had severe endometriosis. She underwent hysterectomy 8 years later. The second patient presented with foul smelling vaginal discharge when she was 21 years old. She had a simple vaginal septum resection.

Summary and Conclusion

In the presence of uterine cavities in a regularly menstruating girl with dysmenorrhea, the presence of both kidneys should be checked. When unilateral renal agenesis and uterus didelphys coexist the first thing that we should remember is to confirm or refute the presence of a blind vagina.

### Rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina in an adolescent girl [^112vJaut]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gynecologic neoplasms are rare in children and represent only less than 5% of all childhood tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of the female genital tract of children accounts for only 3.5% of the cases.

Case

A 16-year-old adolescent presented with a proliferating growth and foul smelling discharge from her vagina, which, on biopsy was diagnosed as RMS. She received chemotherapy and radiation to the primary site. She is alive in remission at 8 years, and with normal menstrual function.

Summary and Conclusion

RMS of the vagina is a rare, but highly curable tumor in adolescent girls. Any abnormal vaginal bleeding in girls should be promptly investigated using pelvic examination and appropriate imaging. An organ-preserving approach should be considered in these patients.

### Incarcerated foreign body in the vagina – a metal bangle used as a pessary [^11647K2h]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Long-forgotten vaginal pessaries get incarcerated in the vagina and their removal poses problems. A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with foul smelling purulent discharge per vaginum and stress incontinence. Speculum examination revealed foul smelling white discharge per vaginum and a friable vaginal wall which bled on touch. The anterior portion of a metal ring deeply embedded in the vagina was seen. The cervix appeared normal. Attempts of removal by traction under local infiltration failed and resulted in bleeding. Biopsy from the tissue covering the ring reported no evidence of malignancy. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 1 week and the metallic ring was removed without any complications under general anaesthesia using electrocautery. It was found to be a metallic bangle with design. It is essential to gently cauterise and release the fibrosis over the incarcerated foreign body to achieve safe removal.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115QbQcF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor, or Discharge

The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.

Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication. Therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and practices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices (e.g. douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal medications or other products should be elicited. The infections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms are BV (i.e. replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, A. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal vaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually transmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently diagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are being evaluated for an STI.

### Diagnostic performance of an automated microscopy and pH test for diagnosis of vaginitis [^115DLi6V]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal symptoms, collectively termed vulvovaginitis, are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Most women will experience at least one episode of vaginal infection during their lifetime, characterized by discharge, itch, burning, or odor. Vulvovaginitis is caused by various infectious and non-infectious conditions that may present as an acute, short-term complaint, or as a chronic disorder. Vaginitis conditions, and more so in their recurrent or chronic forms, have a negative impact on women's health-related quality of lifecontributing to a major negative impact on self-esteem and sexual relationships. Mixed vaginitis, where at least two types of vaginitis are present, is reported in 4.4% to 35% of evaluated patients.

### Nonspecific vaginitis. diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations [^117UifPn]. The American Journal of Medicine (1983). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Amsel's diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis" for bacterial vaginosis.

Calculator Name: Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis

Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis is a clinical tool used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This calculator applies to women presenting with symptoms of vaginal discharge, discomfort, or odor.

The clinical utility of Amsel's criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which can help guide appropriate treatment and prevent potential complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections.

The criteria include the presence of at least three of the following: thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge; clue cells on microscopy; pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5; and a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (whiff test).

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of Amsel's criteria. However, it should be noted that this diagnostic tool may not be as accurate in postmenopausal women, as the vaginal environment naturally changes with age and may affect the results. Additionally, it should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other clinical findings and tests.

The Amsel's diagnostic criteria calculator helps determine the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis based on four specific clinical features. Each feature is assessed to ascertain its presence:

- Homogeneous vaginal discharge
- Fishy odor when potassium hydroxide solution is added to vaginal secretions
- Presence of clue cells on wet mount microscopy
- Vaginal pH greater than 4.5

To compute the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis, each of these features is evaluated as true or false. If a feature is present, it is assigned a score of 1; if not, a score of 0. The scores for all four criteria are then summed to obtain a total score, ranging from 0 to 4.

The interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- If the score is 3 or 4, bacterial vaginosis is likely.
- If the score is 0, 1, or 2, bacterial vaginosis is unlikely.

This approach provides a straightforward method of assessment, facilitating quick clinical decision-making based on the presence of key symptoms and observations.

### Clinical evaluation of a new molecular test for the detection of organisms causing vaginitis and vaginosis [^117XW1WW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Vaginal complaints are the most common reason for women to seek medical care, with global prevalence ranging from 23% to 29% in women of reproductive age. Most women will experience at least one episode of vaginitis in their lifetime. Vaginal complaints are most often a result of either bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), or trichomoniasis. BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive aged women, accounting for 40 to 50% of cases. Among women aged 14 to 49 participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of BV was found to be 29.2%, and the estimated annual incidence of trichomoniasis among women in the US is 3.5 million cases.

While vaginitis and vaginosis are common, achieving an accurate diagnosis is elusive in most practice settings. Practice guidelines recommend the use the Amsel's clinical criteria, the Nugent score, or culture-based methods for diagnosis of symptomatic vaginitis/vaginosis. According to Amsel criteria, diagnosis of BV is based upon the presence of 3 out of 4 of the following clinical criteria: (i) vaginal pH > 4.5; (ii) homogenous white/gray adherent vaginal discharge; (iii) the presence of clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells covered in bacteria); and (iv) a positive whiff test (fishy odor after addition of potassium hydroxide). Although frequently used as an office-based assessment, the Amsel criteria is reported to be subjective, and prone to high rate of misdiagnosis. Further, given the reduction in frequency of speculum-assisted examinations, exacerbated in response to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic reduction in clinical services for sexually transmitted infections (STI), Amsel criteria cannot be fully evaluated, and rely on only 3 rather than 4 criteria, which further reduces accuracy. While Nugent score (a Gram stain scoring system based on the quantitative assessment of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and Mobiluncus spp.) is deemed less subjective, it is dependent on user's expertise with microscopy, has higher turnaround time, and is prone to misdiagnosis, especially for fungal-based vaginosis and mixed infections. This method is not widely used in the clinical setting. In order to perform these tests successfully, the clinician must have access to microscopy, proficiency in microscopy, pH paper, and the other supplies needed to perform a wet mount and KOH screen.

### Current practices in Brazil on diagnosis and management of women with vulvodynia [^112U3cQQ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vulvodynia (VVD) is a frequent and harrowing condition for which diagnosis and management remain insufficient. Our study aimed to describe and compare vulvovaginal signs and symptoms of Brazilian women with VVD and controls and describe previous medical assessment, past treatments, and vulvar pain relief among women with VVD.

Methods

This cross-sectional descriptive study included Brazilian women with (n = 151) and without VVD (n = 106). All women were assessed for vaginal infection, vulvar pain intensity by means of a cotton swab test based on a numerical rate scale, and answered the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire and a structured instrument about current vulvar symptoms. Previous treatments were assessed in the VVD group, and vulvar pain relief achieved with previous treatments was qualified through a 4-point Likert scale.

Results

Volunteers were mainly White, with mean age of 30 years. Vulvovaginal signs and symptoms were significantly more frequent in women with VVD (p < .05), and vulvar pain duration was 5.8 (± 4) years. More than 50% consulted with three or more physicians, and 49% remained without a conclusive diagnosis. Previous diagnosis and treatment of vulvovaginal infection were often reported by women with VVD. Most of the tried prescriptions were self-reported as providing only low vulvar pain relief.

Conclusions

Prolonged duration of vulvar pain, multiple visits to health care professionals, and poor relief of pain are common aspects in the clinical history of women with VVD. In addition to pain, vulvar fissure, edema, erythema, vaginal discharge, and foul odor are common and should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis. Appropriate treatments to VVD are still poorly reported.

A 7-year 8-month-old girl was diagnosed with a prolonged course of vulvovaginitis caused by Shigella flexneri. The child was symptomatic with intermittent vaginal bleeding, dysuria and foul smelling vaginal discharge for a 3-year period. Initial attempts to resolve the infection with successive courses of antibiotic therapy using ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefixime and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid failed. The child's infection was finally resolved by a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

Knowledge of pregnant women on key danger signs during pregnancy, LAD, and the post-partum period

About 461(65.2%) reported spontaneously that they heard about serious problems/danger signs during pregnancy, almost a similar proportion of women heard about LAD danger signs, however a relatively lower proportion of women 401(56.7%) heard about postpartum danger signs. Among women who heard about danger signs, vaginal bleeding was the most commonly mentioned danger sign during pregnancy 372(80.7%), labor and delivery 393(85.1%) and the post-partum period 345(86.1%). Blurring of vision was mentioned by 266(57.7%) of women who heard about danger signs during pregnancy and this accounts for 37.6% of the seven hundred seven pregnant women included in the study. Out of a total number of women in the study 52.6, 37.6 and 23.5% of them mentioned vaginal bleeding, blurring of vision and swollen hands or face as a danger sign during pregnancy respectively. Retained placenta was the second most commonly mentioned key danger sign among women who heard about LAD danger signs 207(44.8%). Out of a total number of women in the study only 55.6, 29.3, 28.3, and 11.3% mentioned vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, prolonged labor, and convulsion as a danger sign during LAD respectively.

More than half of women who reported spontaneously that they heard about danger signs during the postpartum period 218(54.4%) mentioned foul-smelling vaginal discharge as a danger sign during the postpartum period. Out of a total number of women included in the study only 48.8, 30.8, 14.7% mentioned vaginal bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge and high grade fever as a danger sign during the postpartum period respectively. Regarding the knowledge of the pregnant women during pregnancy, LAD, and the post-partum period more than a third of pregnant women 259(36.6%), a sizeable proportion of them 101(14.3%), and about a third of them 220 (31.1%) were knowledgeable on key danger signs during pregnancy, LAD and the postpartum period respectively (Table 4).

### Predictors of maternal psychological distress in rural India: a cross-sectional community-based study [^111ApASg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

2.2 Participants and assessment

Data were available for 5801 mothers who gave birth between July 31st, 2006, and July 30th, 2008 in 18 population clusters. Participants (mothers) were identified as follows: community-based key informants were responsible for reporting any births, and maternal and neonatal deaths within a catchment area of 250 households. Interviewers verified births and deaths and all consenting mothers were given a structured questionnaire interview around 6 weeks after delivery. Follow-up and response rates were high (> 90%) and are described in detail elsewhere. The questionnaire captured information on the mother's socio-demographic background and events during the antepartum, delivery and postpartum periods. After examining the existing literature on maternal common mental disorders including depression, we selected the following potential predictors for analysis:
(a) Socio-economic factors including maternal age; education; literacy; caste or tribal group; land and asset ownership; possession of a Below Poverty Line card which entitles one's household to subsidized food grain, healthcare and housing.
(b) Gender-related factors including mother's decision-making power concerning daily household expenditure and healthcare-seeking for herself in case of illness; food restrictions in the postpartum period (only one meal a day).
(c) Physical and reproductive health factors including parity, caesarean section, consumption of alcohol in pregnancy, and unwanted pregnancy by the mother or father Health problems during pregnancy, including at least one of the following: severe stomach pain; excessive vomiting; fever for more than 24 h; excessive vaginal bleeding; jaundice; reduced/no foetal movement; self-reported symptoms of malaria. Health problems during delivery, including at least one of the following: high fever in the 3 days before labour, foul smelling vaginal discharge; prolonged labour; fits or convulsions; vaginal bleeding; retained placenta; tear around birth passage; umbilical cord around infant's neck. Health problems in the postpartum period (the first 6 weeks after birth), including at least one of the following: severe stomach pain; fever for more than 24 h; foul smelling discharge; excessive vaginal bleeding; leaking from vagina.
(d) Factors related to the birth outcome, including mother perceiving her infant to be smaller than average; stillbirth (infant never cried or breathed after delivery) and neonatal death (death between birth and 28 completed days of life), grouped into one variable (infant loss).

### Evaluation of vulvovaginitis in the adolescent patient [^114Vnx7S]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginitis, referring to inflammation of the vulva and vagina, is a commonly reported concern among adolescents and young women presenting for gynecologic care. Symptoms of vulvovaginitis may include vaginal discharge, odor, itching, pain, dysuria, skin irritation, burning, and dyspareunia. Vulvovaginitis may result from infectious or non-infectious causes. Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis represent the three most common infectious causes of vulvovaginitis in adolescents and young adults. Additionally, non-infectious causes such as the presence of a foreign body in the vagina, chemical irritants, douching, and poor hygiene may also lead to symptoms of vulvovaginitis. A thorough history in combination with the appropriate physical examination and laboratory evaluation is necessary to identify the cause of a patient's symptoms. Importantly, adolescent patients should be given the opportunity to speak privately with the provider without a parent or guardian present in the room, particularly when gathering the sexual history. Appropriate anticipatory guidance and counseling should be provided once a diagnosis has been made, and prevention of future episodes of vulvovaginitis should be discussed.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ms1t3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is a frequent condition in women of childbearing age and is responsible for approximately 50% of outpatient consultations in gynecological offices. Typical symptoms include vulvovaginal itching, discharge, irritation, dyspareunia, and unpleasant odor. These symptoms can be traced back to one of the following 4 entities: vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis (DIV/AV), and trichomoniasis. Nevertheless, there are other and less common causes for these symptoms, such as cytolytic vaginosis, although the existence of this condition is rather controversial.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis, or less often referred to as candidosis, is a common vaginal infection, with 75% of all patients reporting at least 1 episode of VVC in their life. In 80%–95% of all symptomatic cases, VVC is caused by Candida albicans. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can often be suspected clinically, although clinical diagnoses are associated with high error rates. Hence, it is recommended to verify the diagnosis of VVC by the identification of pseudohyphae on phase-contrast microscopy; further diagnostic measures include cultural diagnosis and the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction, which are both of highest importance in complex and recurrent cases. Fungal culture, however, is still considered the criterion standard for VVC diagnosis. –

Bacterial vaginosis is widely considered a form of vaginal dysbiosis and the most common bacterial syndrome of the vagina. Pathogens most frequently associated with BV are Gram-negative Gardnerella species, Fannyhessea vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. In most cases, BV can be suspected using the Amsel criteria: homogeneous, grayish-white discharge, vaginal pH of 4.5 or higher, positive amine whiff test, and the presence of clue cells on microscopy. Microscopic evaluation of Gram-stained smears and determination of the Nugent score is widely considered the criterion standard method for BV diagnosis. The Hay-Ison criteria represent another simplified and effective method for BV diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis treatment is recommended for symptomatic patients, apart from an ongoing discussion on the screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV in pregnant women due to their increased risk of preterm birth; currently, recommendations on this topic are inconsistent. –

### Comparative genomics of the parasite trichomonas vaginalis reveals genes involved in spillover from birds to humans [^113YSL9K]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Trichomoniasis, the most prevalent non-viral venereal disease of humans, is caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis that infects the lower genital tract of men (urethra and prostate) and women (vulva, vagina, and cervix). Symptoms include foul-smelling vaginal discharge and genital itching, and infections are associated with an increased risk of cervical and prostate cancer, HIV-1 infection, and complications during pregnancy. Other human-infecting trichomonads include the oral parasite Trichomonas tenax associated with periodontal disease, and the intestinal parasite Pentatrichomonas hominis associated with gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea. Trichomonad species also infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including birds, livestock, and pets. Trichomonas gallinae infects the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract of birds, including doves, pigeons, songbirds, and raptors that prey on infected birds, and is responsible for a large decline of greenfinch and chaffinch populations in Great Britain in the early 2000s. In 2008, novel parasites with highly genetically similar markers to T. vaginalis (dubbed "T. vaginalis -like ") were reported in white-winged doves and mourning doves from Arizona and Texas, and in Pacific coast band-tailed pigeons from California. T. vaginalis -like parasites recovered from the latter during a 2011–12 outbreak were analyzed in detail and given the species name Trichomonas stableri. T. vaginalis may have originated as a zoonosis from American pigeons and doves during a spillover event following human colonization of the Americas. It has been hypothesized that its ancestor moved from the upper GI tract of columbids into the human reproductive tract via barrier contraceptives or more commonly through human contact with bird-infected water.

### Evaluation of a point-of-care test, BVBlue, and clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^11652udU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) remains the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age and is associated with increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections and preterm delivery. Present diagnostic methods require access to microscopy and laboratory expertise; however, the majority of women, particularly those in populations with a high prevalence of BV, do not have access to clinical services with on-site microscopy capabilities. We evaluated a point-of-care test for the diagnosis of BV, the BVBlue test, with 288 women attending a sexual health service with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge and/or odor. The BVBlue test performed well compared with conventional diagnostic methods for the assessment of women with symptoms suggestive of BV at the bedside and significantly better than other simple tests, such as vaginal pH determination and the amine test, that do not require microscopy. The BVBlue test was sensitive (88%; 95% confidence interval, 81 to 93%) and specific (95%; 95% CI, 91 to 98%) compared to the method of Nugent et al. (R. P. Nugent, M. A. Krohn, and S. L. Hillier, J. Clin. Microbiol. 29:297–301, 1991) and performed well compared with the method of Amsel et al. (R. Amsel, P. A. Totten, C. A. Spiegel, K. C. Chen, D. Eschenbach, and K. K. Holmes, Am. J. Med. 74:14–22, 1983), with a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI, 81 to 93%) and a specificity of 91% (95% CI, 85 to 94%). The BVBlue test is a simple, rapid, and objective test for the diagnosis of BV and has the potential to facilitate prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of BV in the absence of microscopy. The majority of women at the greatest risk for the sequelae of BV are not in settings where the conventional diagnostic methods are either practical or possible, and they would greatly benefit from access to rapid and reliable point-of-care tests to improve the diagnosis and management of BV.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification testing for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in symptomatic or high-risk women. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, and patients' sex partners should be treated as well. Treatment of noninfectious vaginitis should be directed at the underlying cause. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. Inflammatory vaginitis may improve with topical clindamycin as well as steroid application.

### Mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in rectovaginal fistulas associated with Crohn's disease [^1163BNyk]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by focal, transmural inflammation of the intestine. Gynecologic involvement, including rectovaginal fistula formation, is frequent. Case #1. A 53-year-old female with a 30-year history of Crohn's disease and numerous perirectal fistulas developed a foul smelling, purulent drainage from her rectum and a mucopurulent, bloody discharge from her vagina. A lower vaginal lesion biopsy demonstrated a low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma. Case #2. A 42-year-old female with a 15-year history of Crohn's disease developed drainage from her vagina. Physical examination revealed an enlarging mass involving the posterior wall of the vaginal vault that connected to the anus by a fistula tract. A biopsy revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma.

Conclusions

Malignant transformation of persistent rectovaginal fistulas is a potential complication of Crohn's disease.

Case presentation

A 31-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, underwent a routine antenatal examination in the hospital. During the pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism and gestational diabetes were diagnosed and the woman received appropriate treatment for these conditions. Minor vaginal bleeding had occurred at 25 weeks of gestation and ultrasonography found no abnormality. In the detailed ultrasonography examination at 28 weeks, the umbilical venous walls were thickened, with hyperechogenicity and calcification (Fig. 1 left). There were no unusual infective symptoms or signs such as fever, abdominal pain or foul-smelling vaginal discharge. The maternal white blood cell count and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were all normal and the screenings for TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus) serology were negative.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116ZcbgY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis, which most often manifests clinically as abnormal discharge, dysuria, odor, or itching, is one of the most common causes of primary care office visits for women in the United States. Women seek care from a variety of provider types or clinical settings including obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN), family planning, family practice, internal medicine, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. For symptomatic women, diagnostic testing often depends on the clinic type, available diagnostic services, and provider assumptions about their clientele. These real-world factors could result in restricted diagnostic testing of some causes of vaginitis, to the exclusion of others. In addition, comprehensive diagnostic testing for women in primary care settings can be hampered by a reliance on clinical methods (eg, wet prep microscopy and visual assessment of discharge) that are subjective and/or require specialized equipment and training. In other cases, testing may carry stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As public funds continue to be withdrawn from STD-specific clinical services, primary care providers must take on the additional responsibility of providing these services for their clients. Making this type of testing both simple (eg, through use of a single sample) and normative (ie, it is provided for everyone with these symptoms) will both improve services for women and reduce the stigma associated with STI testing.

A distinction is often drawn by providers between vaginitis (which is generally not perceived as an STI) and STIs, which have a negative connotation associated with unsafe behavior. However, Gardnerella vaginalis, the predominate bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), is considered by many to be associated with sexual activity, if not strictly an STI, and several studies have shown a correlation between sexual behaviors and risk for BV. In addition, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) was initially considered to be transmitted by fomites, but is now known to be transmitted almost exclusively through sexual contact. TV is included in "vaginitis" guidelines because it is usually considered a vaginal infection and causes vaginal symptoms, whereas Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) cause cervical infection and cervicitis. Thus, many practitioners in non-STD clinical settings do not consider TV to be an STI, which largely restricts diagnostic coverage to vaginitis panels.

BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS

The Microbiome Characteristics of BV

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial disorder, which is considered the most common cause of vaginal discharge, affecting millions of reproductive-aged women worldwide. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with multiple adverse gynecologic and obstetrics consequences, including an increased risk of preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and acquisition of STIs including HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).

The diagnosis of BV is complicated by the lack of consensus on its definition, the natural difference of the VMB in women of diverse racial backgrounds, and its polymicrobial etiology. Symptomatic BV can be described as a syndrome based on the presence of clinical features (discharge and/or malodor) interpreted by vaginal fluid features (i.e. Amsel criteria) or gram stain (the Nugent score), without a specific etiologic agent defined. Bacterial vaginosis is not characterized by inflammation on microscopy, with relative absence of polymorphonuclear cells on wet mount, and was therefore termed "vaginosis" and not "vaginitis". Despite decades of research, the etiology of BV remains unknown; it is a form of vaginal dysbiosis, marked by depletion of lactobacilli and proliferation of various gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria.

The epidemiology of BV strongly suggests that it may be acquired via sexual transmission, and it is associated with various risk factors, including a new sexual partner, douching, and smoking. Although usually treatable with antibiotics, recurrence is a major problem, with relapse rates greater than 50% within 12 months of treatment.

Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed clinically in 1 of 2 ways: Amsel criteria or Nugent score. Amsel criteria comprises a set of 4 criteria including: (1) vaginal discharge, (2) fishy odor with or without the addition of 10% KOH (whiff test), (3) elevated pH > 4.5, and (4) the presence of clue cells (epithelial cells studded with adherent bacteria) on microscopy, with 3 of 4 criteria are required to make a positive diagnosis. The Nugent score is based on gram-stained vaginal smear, with high numbers of lactobacilli species being indicative of health, and their depletion coupled with increased numbers of small and/or curved gram variable rods being indicative of BV.

### Xanthogranulomatous endometritis with unilateral salpingo-oophoritis in a postmenopausal woman masquerading as a malignancy [^112QSX6f]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

A postmenopausal woman in her 70s, with past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presented with pain in the suprapubic and left iliac regions with minimal white discharge per vaginum for 6 weeks. She didn't reveal any significant previous gynaecological history. On examination, the patient was afebrile and vitals were stable. General physical examination was normal and systemic examination revealed the scar of previous sterilisation. On abdominal examination she had mild tenderness in the suprapubic region but no mass was palpable. On speculum examination, parous external os with purulent yellowish discharge was noted which was non-foul smelling. Erosion was noted in the posterior lip of the cervix. On bimanual examination the uterus was retroverted, enlarged to 8–10 weeks size, and bilateral forniceal tenderness was present.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole vaginal) [^111NNnWg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

NOTE: For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^1176CAmG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

(.)

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are common in women of reproductive age. The prevalence of BV and TV in the United States (US) is 29% and 3%, respectively, but can vary depending on the study population. Adverse sequelae associated with BV and TV include increased acquisition of sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus, and pregnancy complications including preterm birth. While the prevalence of VVC cases is unknown, 20% of women are colonized by Candida species in the absence of signs and/or symptoms, and 70% are colonized over a year. Approximately 75% of women will experience at least 1 episode of VVC infection requiring treatment during their lifetimes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines describe the point-of-care tests that can be performed as an adjunct to a clinical history and physical examination to support diagnosis of vaginal discharge syndromes (those not characterized by vulvodynia and noninfectious causes of vaginal symptoms). These tests include measurement of vaginal pH, "whiff" test (addition of potassium hydroxide [KOH] to vaginal fluid for assessment of amine odor), and microscopic examination of fresh samples of the discharge to identify presence of clue cells, motile trichomonads, and/or budding yeast/pseudohyphae. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopic detection of clue cells, yeast, and trichomonads by clinicians can vary considerably. Despite these limitations, the low cost and convenience of point-of-care testing have contributed to their continued use. In a variety of studies, laboratory testing (Nugent score, yeast culture, US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]–approved and independent molecular assays) performed better than clinician-diagnosed vaginitis. CDC guidelines recommend use of alternative commercially available point-of-care tests or clinical laboratory testing in settings where pH paper, KOH, and wet prep evaluation by microscopy are not available.

The primary objective of this study was to assess how women with vaginal discharge syndromes were being evaluated in community practice settings and to assess the appropriateness of the treatments prescribed for BV, TV, and VVC. A second objective was to assess how often women returned for symptoms of vaginitis in the 90 days following treatment and to assess whether the provision of appropriate treatment was related to return office visits for vaginitis symptoms.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter gene polymorphism-308 and chorioamnionitis [^117GX4S5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

A single-base polymorphism within the promoter of the gene for tumor necrosis factor alpha at position -308 relative to the transcriptional start site of the gene is correlated with differences in production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. There are two allelic forms: TNFA1 and TNFA2. The TNFA2 allele is associated with increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between carriage of the TNFA2 allele and clinical chorioamnionitis.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, previously banked deoxyribonucleic acid from 149 women who had spontaneous labor from 37 to 42 weeks' gestation was used. Polymerase chain reaction was used for polymorphism assay. Demographic and clinical information was obtained from the medical record. Clinical chorioamnionitis was defined as at least one temperature elevation above 38C combined with at least two of the following signs: maternal or fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness greater than expected, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, and white blood cell count more than 18,000.

Results

Chorioamnionitis was present in 18 women (12.1%). Among women who did not carry TNFA2, the chorioamnionitis rate was 7.4%. Among women who carried TNFA2, the chorioamnionitis rate was 24.4%. The relative risk for chorioamnionitis with carriage of TNFA2 was 3.3 (95% confidence interval 1.3, 7.1). This increased risk was not altered after adjustment for race, type of rupture of membranes, intrauterine pressure catheter use, smoking, and prolonged rupture of membranes.

Conclusion

Carriage of the TNFA2 allele is associated with a more than three-fold increased risk of clinical chorioamnionitis, even when accounting for important clinical and microbiologic risk factors.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) clinical manifestations include oropharyngeal candidiasis characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface that can be easily scraped off; less commonly, erythematous patches without white plaques occur and angular cheilosis can be caused by Candida. Because a proportion of patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement, clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; occasionally esophageal candidiasis can be asymptomatic, and endoscopic examination reveals whitish plaques that on occasion may progress to superficial ulcerations with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In women with HIV infection, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences; in women with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently; and vulvovaginal candidiasis is less common than oropharyngeal candidiasis and when it occurs, it is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species.

### Bacterial vaginosis: a practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.
- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition, to a decrease in lactobacilli.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.
- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1152aQWC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that smoothly coats the vaginal walls
Clue cells (e.g. vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent bacteria) on microscopic examination
pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5
A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (i.e. the whiff test)

Detection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain. The sensitivity and specificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, respectively, compared with the Nugent score.

In addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are available for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui Diagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity. The Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide probe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis nucleic acids (> 5 x 10 5 CFU of G. vaginalis/ mL of vaginal fluid) for diagnosing BV, Candida species, and T. vaginalis. This test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic women in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and presence of amine odor (sensitivity of 97%); specificity is 81% compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam Test Card (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of trimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis), and proline aminopeptidase. Sensitivity is 91% and specificity is 61%, compared with Nugent. This test has primarily been studied in resource-poor settings, and although it has been reported to be beneficial compared with syndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method for BV diagnosis.

### Aerobic vaginitis in the third trimester and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^1112GzjF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical investigations and sample collection

Pregnant women in the last trimester of pregnancy (≥ 28 weeks) eligible for treatment and/or labor at the Hue University Hospital were asked for general information, clinical examination and sampling. Background data included age, education, profession, marital status, and history of reproductive health (genital tract infections, abortions, and miscarriages).

The women were monitored until delivery, and both maternal and neonatal outcomes were recorded. Clinical data of the pregnant women included PROM, preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), ﻿chorioamnionitis (an acute inflammation of the membranes and chorion of the placenta), ﻿delivery mode, and puerperal health. Puerperal sepsis was defined as the infection of the genital tract occurring at labour or within 42 days of the postpartum period, in which two or more of the following are present: pelvic pain, fever, abnormal foul-smelling vaginal discharge, delay in the reduction of the uterine size. Clinical data of the newborns included birth weight, Apgar scores (comprising five components: color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone, respiration), and neonatal infections.

Vaginal samples were collected mostly (91%) after 37 weeks of pregnancy. Vaginal fluid was taken from the vagina, at the site of suspected infection or at the posterior vaginal fornix. Two sterile cotton swabs were used for sampling. The swabs were transported to the Department of Microbiology in the Hue University Hospital of Medicine and Pharmacy within 2 h or stored at 4 °C within 12 h before sending to the lab. At the lab, one swab was used for making Gram stained slide smear, the second swab was frozen in cryotube (with BHI broth and 20% glycerol) for the subsequent cultures in University of Tartu, Estonia.

Laboratory methods

The microscopic AV diagnostic criteria proposed by Donders et al. were applied under microscope applying both 400 × and 1000 × magnification. Lactobacillary grades, other bacteria, leukocytes and parabasal epithelial cells were recorded. AV was diagnosed as indicated in Table 1. AV was classified as light AV (score 3 or 4), moderate AV (score 5 or 6) and severe AV (score ≥ 7).

In addition, vaginal fluid was cultured onto blood agar media, the cultures were incubated for 18–24 h in aerobic conditions. The predominant colonies were counted and identified by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics) at the Department of Microbiology in University of Tartu, Estonia.

The primary outcome measure was death before hospital discharge. Secondary outcome measures included: NRDS (oxygen requirement, clinical diagnosis, and consistent chest radiograph), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe IVH (grades III or IV), periventricular leukomalacia, blood culture-proven early onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumothorax, neonatal hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, EUGR, and weight, length and head circumference at discharge.

The diagnostic criteria for clinical chorioamnionitis are as follows: maternal body temperature elevation (≥ 37.8 ℃) accompanied by 2 or more of the following abnormalities: increased heart rate (≥ 100 beats/min), increased fetal heart rate (≥ 160 beats/min), uterine tenderness, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, elevated peripheral blood white cell count (≥ 15 × 10^9/L), or a left shift in the differential count. Resuscitation involves extensive measures like positive pressure ventilation, intubation, and chest compressions. Small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile of average birth weight for the same gestational age. Hyperglycemia defined asblood glucose level ≥ 150 mg/dL or 8.3 mmol/L. Hypoglycemia was defined as < 40 mg/ dL in the first 24 h of life. Based on the 2013 Fenton growth curves, infants are defined as having Extrauterine Growth Restriction (EUGR) if their body weight, at discharge or corrected gestational age of 36 weeks, falls below the 10th percentile (P10) for the corresponding gestational age group.

Table 2
Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants who had institutional deliveries compared with those who had non-institutional delivery

Table 3 below shows a comparison of the characteristics of participants who had institutional delivery with those who had non-institutional (home) delivery. Participants from Nyong Payam were more likely to have delivered in the health facility than those from Himodonge Payam (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.8–4.8, P value < 0.001). Only four mothers (2.1%) out of 189 participants from Himodonge Payam had delivered at the health facility compared to 53.3% for Nyong Payam. The participants who had institutional deliveries were significantly younger (mean age 23.3 years SD 5.3 years) compared to those who had non-institutional deliveries (mean age 25.6 years SD 6.3 years) (p = 0.004). However, women who did not know their age tended to have non-institutional deliveries (p < 0.001).

Table 3
Characteristics of Institutional deliveries compared with non-institutional deliveries

Attending school to even primary level was significantly associated with institutional delivery compared to not going to school at all (p < 0.001). Whether or not the woman or the husband wanted the pregnancy at the time of conception did not affect the place of delivery. Attending skilled ANC at least once was significantly associated with institutional deliveries compared to not attending at all (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.8–4.1, p < 0.001). Women who reported having suffered a complication during pregnancy (such as high fever, severe headache, seizures, vaginal bleeding, foul smelling vaginal discharge) were more likely to have an institutional delivery than women who did not (OR = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.3–3.7, p = 0.003). Developing a complication during labor (such as high fever, vaginal bleeding, foul smelling vaginal discharge, seizures, retained placenta, prolonged labor, prolapsed umbilical cord) was also significantly associated with institutional delivery (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.1–4.3, p = 0.03).

Our results on the safety of TA treatment are consistent with published findings both from high-income countries and LMICs, which support a high safety profile of TA. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating safety and efficacy of TA, including 6 studies from LMICs, found mild to moderate adverse effects to be common, with rare severe AEs, consistent with our results. Similar to our findings, vaginal discharge was common after TA in published studies, reported in 99.1% of women in Cameroon, with a mean duration of 16.2 days (SD, 8.4 days). Only a very small percentage of women in that study (2.8%), as in our study (0.96%), received antibiotics for discharge. Of note, the 2 women prescribed antibiotics in our study for foul-smelling vaginal discharge had no fever or other evidence of systemic infection. The majority of women in our study, 181/208 (89.6%), reported experiencing a sensation of heat during treatment, compared with only 13 (25%) in the Brazil study. Our findings of a high rate of acceptability (98% satisfaction, and 100% would recommend TA to a friend) are consistent with Pinder et al, the only study evaluating TA acceptability in an LMIC, who also found that 100% of treated women would recommend TA to others.

### Transvaginal excision of an eroded sacrocolpopexy mesh by using single-incision laparoscopic surgery equipment [^117WDaBS]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show a new technique of using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) equipment in vaginal surgery to create a "pneumovagina".

Design

Explanatory video demonstrating the technique and intraoperative findings.

Setting

University hospital.

Patient

The 68-year-old patient was referred with a vaginal mesh erosion that resulted in abscess formation at the vaginal apex. The patient was symptomatic with an increasingly foul-smelling vaginal discharge for about 1 year. She had a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy in a remote hospital 22 months before the current operation and had a total abdominal hysterectomy 15 years ago. The, patient's history was uneventful without dyspareunia, incontinence or voiding difficulties, and she was otherwise content with the sacrocolpopexy result. The local institutional review board granted exemption for this publication.

Intervention

Frequently, pelvic organ prolapse can only be effectively treated if the surgical procedure comprises support of the central compartment. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy shows superior outcomes for this indication, with success rates of up to 96%. However, a rare side effect of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is mesh erosion, occurring in up to 2.4% [1]. These erosions are usually treated laparoscopically [2]. In this video we show an alternative route for excision of a symptomatic exposed mesh by using a transvaginal approach: The SILS trocar is used vaginally for abscess irrigation and mesh excision with minimally invasive instruments.

Measurements and Main Results

For treatment of the abscess and removal of the exposed mesh, the SILS trocar was placed vaginally, and laparoscopic instruments were used. The abscess was incised, cleansed and irrigated, debrided, and the mesh excised. Because no mesh material was exposed after excision, the vagina was not closed to avoid creating a cavity with the risk of promoting reabscess formation, and secondary wound healing was anticipated. Laparoscopy was used to confirm that no intra-abdominal lesion coexisted or occurred. There were no signs of further infection of the residual mesh beyond the area exposed in the vagina. The patient's only symptom was foul-smelling discharge, but no back pain or signs of systemic inflammation were found. Knowing that foreign body (mesh) infection usually needs to be treated by complete mesh removal, we did not have any clues of distant mesh infection and counseled the patient that if reinfection occurred a second surgery might be necessary. Nevertheless, we treated this patient with abscess drainage and removal of large parts of the mesh. Thus, the operation was not extended to a complete mesh excision to prevent major surgery and the risk of recurrent prolapse. Particularly, the area of the mesh excision was inspected with the rendezvous technique (light source vaginally, laparoscopic pelvic view with laparoscopic light source switched off) to identify the area of mesh excision from the intra-abdominal area. Sigmoid and rectum were distant to this area, suggesting that no bowel lesion occurred. No complications occurred in the postoperative course. In the follow-up visit 6 months postoperatively the patient was asymptomatic, and the vaginal examination was uneventful with no recurrent erosion. Although improved oversight and richness of detail achieved by the vaginal SILS method is helpful in patients like our case with a suspended vaginal vault, its costs need to be balanced against conventional vaginal approaches (e.g., use of a Lonestar retractor).

Conclusion

The SILS trocar and laparoscope used (SILS Port; Covidien, New Haven, CT) vaginally provide a magnificent and detailed view to allow for exact preparation by means of microinvasive instruments in vaginal surgery, even more in patients with a suspended vaginal vault where access to the apex can be tricky. The "pneumovagina" created by CO 2 insufflation further helps to expose the vaginal apex. The rendezvous technique can additionally be used to identify intra-abominal lesions.

### Cuff meshoma post-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy: vaginal-endoscopic mesh excision [^113LutZ5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

A 58-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 2, BMI 18.8 kg/m 2), presented to a tertiary referral center with 5-year history of chronic vaginal infections with foul-smelling vaginal discharge. She had undergone laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy 10 years prior to a referral for vaginal vault prolapse, following vaginal hysterectomy and native tissue anterior–posterior repair for stage III anterior wall and stage III uterine prolapse a year earlier. Numerous antibiotics had been used to treat her for 5 years without improvement, and she had a history of unsuccessful attempts at vaginal mesh removal (4 and 2 years before the current referral). A pelvic examination revealed a 0.5-cm sinus tract near the center of the vaginal cuff but no visible mesh erosion. Ultrasound examination and MRI showed the mesh above the vaginal cuff to be wadded up into a ball (meshoma), infection of the near tissues, and a sinus around the mesh extending up to the level of the sacral promontory. After extended counseling the patient opted for complete removal of the mesh (vaginal, endoscopic, laparoscopic or open, with full previous bowel preparation and cystoscopy with ureter indocyanine green (ICG) infusion/prophylactic stenting of the ureters), as her symptoms were seriously restricting her everyday activities.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole vaginal gel, 0.75%) [^112de675]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

NOTE For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.

### Vulvovaginal symptoms in women with bacterial vaginosis [^113s9HPS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

A substantial, but highly variable, percentage of women with bacterial vaginosis are said to be asymptomatic. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of symptoms among women with bacterial vaginosis compared with women without bacterial vaginosis by direct, explicit, and detailed questioning of these women.

Methods

Women presenting for a routine health care visit at 12 health department clinics in Birmingham, Alabama, were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study of vaginal flora. At the first visit, they underwent a pelvic examination, lower genital tract microbiological evaluation, and an interview that included detailed questions regarding lower genital tract symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms among women with and without bacterial vaginosis (Gram stain score 7 or higher) was compared.

Results

Among 2,888 women without gonorrhea, Chlamydia, or trichomonas, 75% of women with and 82% of women without bacterial vaginosis never noted any vaginal odor in the past 6 months (P < .001). The corresponding values were 63% and 65% for never noting vaginal "wetness" (P = 0.02); 58% and 57% for vaginal discharge (P = 0.65); 91% and 86% for irritation (P = 0.004); 88% and 85% for itching (P = 0.64); and 96% and 94% for dysuria (P = 0.002), respectively. Cumulatively, 58% of women with bacterial vaginosis noted odor, discharge, and/or wetness in the past 6 months compared with 57% of women without bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.70).

Conclusion

The 2 classic symptoms of bacterial vaginosis discharge and odor are each reported by a minority of women with bacterial vaginosis and are only slightly more prevalent than among women without bacterial vaginosis.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^116UJMZk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) remains a common and recurrent cause of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age, with substantial impact in quality of life and health care costs. The clinical diagnosis of BV is based on the presence of at least 3 Amsel criteria: characteristic vaginal discharge; "fishy" smell, clue cells; and vaginal pH greater than 4.5. Bacterial vaginosis can also be diagnosed using the Nugent score, a microscopic assessment of a Gram staining of the vaginal discharge, rarely performed at the point of care because it requires more time, trained personnel, and specialized equipment.

First-line treatments for BV are metronidazole and clindamycin. Their 1- to 4-week cure rate is 55% to 90%, but the recurrence rate within 6 months is 30% to 70%. This high recurrence has been attributed to the bacterial biofilm, a protective bacterial reservoir that neither treatment is able to eradicate. Moreover, antibiotics have frequent adverse effects and carry the risk of development of resistance; thus, effective nonantibiotic treatments for BV are needed.

One such alternative is dequalinium chloride, a broad-spectrum antiseptic effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, used since the 1950s. Several clinical studies, have reported the efficacy and safety of dequalinium chloride against vaginal infections. Dequalinium chloride is recommended by several international and European guidelines as alternative treatment for BV or inflammatory vaginitis. Dequalinium chloride adsorbs into the cell surface, altering its permeability; disrupts protein synthesis; and induces protein denaturation and precipitation of nucleic acids. Due to these multiple modes of action, the development of resistance is unlikely. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed recently that dequalinium chloride disrupts the bacterial biofilm and impairs metabolic activity. Dequalinium chloride was shown to be noninferior to clindamycin for treatment of BV; thus, the primary objective of this study was to assess the noninferiority of dequalinium chloride compared with oral metronidazole, the other first-line treatment.

### Ethnic disparity in diagnosing asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis using machine learning [^114fGGKU]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal syndrome among women of reproductive age and is associated with a multitude of adverse complications including the risk of preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease –, STIs, and HIV infection. The global prevalence for BV is high, ranging from 21% to 29%, with disproportionately higher diagnoses in Black and Hispanic women. BV is characterized by a non-optimal vaginal microbiome, with a shift away from a low-diversity profile dominated by lactobacilli to a high-diversity profile with an increase in anaerobic organisms (i.e. Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia). Syndromic BV is characterized by vaginal discomfort, malodor, increased vaginal pH, and itching and is traditionally diagnosed using Amsel's criteria and/or Nugent scoring. However, a substantial number of women with BV are asymptomatic, with an absence of vaginal discharge or odor, which causes difficulty in diagnosis and treatment.

More than half of the women with diagnosable BV have no clear symptoms. Patients' perception of their vaginal symptoms varies significantly and does not necessarily correlate with signs of BV. Some women do not report symptoms; nevertheless, discharge is noted on examination by a clinician, and diagnostic criteria are present, highlighting that many women with BV may consider their discharge to be normal. These women may be asymptomatic despite the presence of BV. This may contribute to the debate regarding the definition of "normal" VMB, as was discussed in part I.

### Noncandidal vaginitis: a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management [^114ubumW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is one of the most common causes of patient visits to gynecologists, primary care providers, and urgent care centers. However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.

### Exploring the vaginal ecosystem: insights into host-microbe interactions and microbial community dynamics [^111e7qyA]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

States of vaginal dysbiosis: BV, AV, VVC, and CV

BV is the most common type of vaginitis experienced among reproductive age women, with a worldwide prevalence of 23%–29% of women affected. BV is associated with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria from genera such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, Sneathia, Mobiluncus, Fannyhessea, and Finegoldia to name a few. Individuals who present with BV-associated microbes are at an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and cervical dysplasia, and while screening for BV is not recommended during pregnancy, a meta-analysis study indicated that BV-positive individuals have twice the risk of preterm labor and nine times higher risk of spontaneous abortion. BV is diagnosed by Amsel's criteria or Nugent score. Amsel's criteria assess clinical signs and symptoms including the presence of thin homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid pH > 4.5, discharge with a fishy odor (i.e. the whiff test), and presence of "clue cells" by examination of vaginal epithelial cells with adherent bacteria. Nugent scores are based on Gram stain interpretation of microbial morphology from a vaginal smear. In addition to these standard methods, multiple point-of-care and molecular-based tests are commercially available; however, they are still recommended for use in association with a standard method of diagnosis. Although these methods can be useful at identifying patients with active BV, there are disparities between the diagnosis and the symptoms experienced. A recent metagenomic study found that of patients who were BV-positive based on Amsel's criteria, only 12.3% had confirmed BV and were actively symptomatic.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynaecological and obstetric sequelae including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those that do, it is the symptoms themselves, including malodour and vaginal discharge, that cause significant distress to women and impact on their quality of life and relationships. Current evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterised by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli, and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp. and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). While the exact pathogen/s responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesised that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

The efficacy of XACIATO as a treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in females 12 years of age and older was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study (Trial 1, NCT04370548). A single dose of XACIATO (clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel, 2%) was compared to a single dose of placebo vaginal gel (hydroxyethylcellulose [HEC] Universal Placebo Gel) for the treatment of BV. Patients were evaluated at 3 timepoints: a Day 1 Screening/Randomization visit, a Day 7 to 14 Interim Assessment visit, and a Day 21 to 30 Test of Cure visit. The total study duration was up to approximately 1 month for each individual patient.

To be eligible, patients had to have a clinical diagnosis of BV defined as an off-white (milky or gray), thin, homogeneous discharge with minimal or absent pruritus and inflammation of the vulva and vagina, clue cells > 20% of the total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of the saline wet mount, vaginal secretion pH of > 4.5, and a fishy odor of the vaginal discharge with the addition of a drop of 10% KOH (i.e., a positive whiff test).

Q11. During office examinations, there is no benefit to routine vaginal cleaning, unless there is excess or abnormal vaginal discharge, bleeding, or odor; there are no clinical trials or guidelines regarding the use of cleansing agents in the vagina for women who wear a pessary, cleansing agents have not been shown to reduce pessary-related complications, and there is no evidence that cleansing the vagina during a pessary visit is helpful. Vaginal cleaning could potentially incur an additional outpatient office charge for the patient, several trials have failed to show a benefit of more frequent office visits in preventing vaginal discharge and infection, and if there is excess or abnormal vaginal discharge, the use of dry swabs is usually adequate with saline or water preferred to cleansing agents for use in the vagina; in the Delphi survey, 87.5% (7 participants) strongly agreed and 12.5% (1 participant) weakly agreed with this statement.

Abstract

Background

Although vaginal symptoms are common, diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is not standardized. Diagnostic approaches and appropriateness of treatment were evaluated for women with symptoms of vaginitis who were seeking care at community practice sites.

Methods

Three hundred three symptomatic women, across 8 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center–affiliated clinics, were evaluated per standard office-based practice. Four of 5 vaginal swabs (1 cryopreserved) were collected for a US Food and Drug Administration–authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for vaginitis/vaginosis diagnosis; Nugent scoring (BV); yeast culture (VVC); and a second NAAT (for TV). Two hundred ninety women had evaluable samples. Medical record extraction facilitated verification of treatments prescribed within 7 days of the index visit and return visit frequency within 90 days.

Results

Women had a mean age of 29.4 ± 6.5 years, 90% were not pregnant, 79% were of white race, and 38% reported vaginitis treatment within the past month. Point-of-care tests, including vaginal pH (15%), potassium hydroxide/whiff (21%), and wet mount microscopy (17%), were rarely performed. Of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis, 81 (47%) received 1 or more inappropriate prescriptions. Of the 120 women without BV, TV, or VVC, 41 (34%) were prescribed antibiotics and/or antifungals. Among women without infectious vaginitis, return visits for vaginitis symptoms were more common among women treated empirically compared to those not receiving treatment (9/41 vs 5/79, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Within a community practice setting, 42% of women having vaginitis symptoms received inappropriate treatment. Women without infections who received empiric treatment were more likely have recurrent visits within 90 days.

### Host-vaginal microbiota interactions in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^114wuNHM]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The cause of bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women, remains controversial. We recently published an updated conceptual model on bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis, focusing on the roles of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia as early colonizers and Atopobium vaginae and other bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) as secondary colonizers in this infection. In this article, we extend the description of our model to include a discussion on the role of host-vaginal microbiota interactions in bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.

Recent Findings

Although G. vaginalis and P. bivia are highly abundant in women with bacterial vaginosis, neither induce a robust inflammatory response from vaginal epithelial cells. These early colonizers may be evading the immune system while establishing the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. Secondary colonizers, including A. vaginae, Sneathia spp., and potentially other BVAB are more potent stimulators of the host-immune response to bacterial vaginosis and likely contribute to its signs and symptoms as well as its adverse outcomes.

Summary

Elucidating the cause of bacterial vaginosis has important implications for diagnosis and treatment. Our current bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis model provides a framework for key elements that should be considered when designing and testing novel bacterial vaginosis diagnostics and therapeutics.

### Advances in biomonitoring technologies for women's health [^111R7r8m]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Wireless wearable technologies for vaginal infection

Vaginitis, or vaginal infection, one of the most common reasons women seek medical attention, impacts sexual and reproductive health. Symptoms include itching, pain, abnormal discharge, and odor, often leading to feelings of embarrassment, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. The three most common types of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis.

BV, the most frequent vaginal infection among reproductive-age women, is characterized by microbiome imbalances, particularly a loss of Lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Mobiluncus. Diagnosis traditionally relies on microscopy-based Nugent scoring and Amsel's criteria, assessing discharge appearance, odor, and vaginal pH (pH > 4.5). However, these methods suffer from poor sensitivity, inter-observer variability, and reliance on skilled personnel. Similarly, VVC and trichomoniasis are diagnosed through microscopy, and in vitro pH assessment, both of which have limited accuracy. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) diagnostic techniques enhance the specificity and sensitivity of detection by leveraging molecular mechanisms through microorganism DNA detection in biological samples. Regardless, current PCR platforms are only used for clinical and laboratory testing as equipment is costly and requires trained personnel, making it difficult for at-home monitoring.

The association ofinfection with vaginitis is of interest and is perhaps substantiated by the accompanying association with an abnormal vaginal odor. This symptom is typically associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal symptoms have not been frequently associated withinfection. Indeed, a recent study evaluating the syndromic management of vaginal discharge concluded that an abnormal vaginal discharge was not a sensitive criterion for capturinginfection. Two other previous studies have reported an increased risk of acquiringamong women with BV, and the association with vaginitis observed here may reflect an association with BV, although studies are inconsistent. another known cause of vaginitis, has also been associated withinfection. Regrettably, neither a BV diagnosis nortest results were provided in the context of this study, so we were unable to evaluate the extent to which BV orinfection might explain this association. In our clinical performance study, the sensitivity of the investigational AMG assay was the highest with self-obtained vaginal swab samples (98.9%) and lower with endocervical swab samples (81.5%), and self-obtained vaginal swabs were the preferred sample type. This supports the possibility thatcauses vaginal as well as cervical infection, and this warrants further investigation.

### Laparoscopic oocyte retrieval for fertility preservation in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina [^112akqZ7]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe a feasible fertility preservation strategy in a woman with vaginal carcinoma.

Design

Video case report demonstrating the diagnostic work-up and laparoscopic oocyte retrieval performed under regional anesthesia.

Setting

University tertiary care hospital.

Patient(S)

A 35-year-old nulliparous woman presented with vaginal bleeding and foul-smelling vaginal discharge. After a comprehensive diagnostic work-up, a final diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina stage II (Federation International Obstetrics and Gynecology classification) was made. As per the patient's desire, before undergoing chemoradiotherapy, the patient underwent oocyte cryopreservation. Transvaginal retrieval of oocytes was not feasible because of stenosis of the vaginal introitus and the potential risk of intracavitary tumor cell spillage. Transabdominal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval was not possible because of the body's habitus.

Intervention(S)

The patient underwent ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization. To minimize estrogen levels, letrozole was used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Laparoscopic oocyte retrieval was performed under spinal anesthesia.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Successful laparoscopic egg retrieval and cryopreservation in a woman with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina.

Result(S)

A total follicular count of nine was estimated before the oocyte retrieval. Eight oocytes were retrieved at laparoscopy, and eight mature oocytes were successfully cryopreserved. No complications were encountered, and the patient was discharged on the same day of surgery.

Conclusion(S)

To our knowledge, this is the first published case of fertility preservation using the laparoscopic approach in a patient with vaginal cancer. Letrozole is a valuable strategy to reduce high estrogen in patients with gynecological cancer undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Laparoscopy oocyte retrieval, performed under regional anesthesia, can be performed in an ambulatory setting and should be considered an effective fertility preservation strategy in patients with large vaginal tumors.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Kp3av]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — clinical manifestations: Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, gums, oropharynx, or tongue surface, and lesions can often be scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. A proportion of people with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement; clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in people with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; it can be asymptomatic, endoscopy reveals whitish plaques similar to oropharyngeal disease, and plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In people with HIV, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity with sporadic recurrences, is less common in people with HIV, and when it occurs is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species; in those with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112LEkkc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of vaginitis has been inaccurate. – Wet mount microscopy has very low sensitivity for all three causes of vaginitis. Availability of a microscope, appropriate training, and certification (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)are required to perform microscopy in the clinic setting and to accurately identify the correct causes of vaginitis. Non–microscopy-based diagnostic criteria, with either low sensitivity (eg, vaginal discharge, whiff test) or low specificity (eg, vaginal pH), thus, do not consistently facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Women who receive empiric treatment for vaginitis, without a known etiology, are more likely to return for a physician visit within 90 days.

New technologies, using molecular (DNA) targets that identify the etiologic factors for vaginitis, have recently been developed to address some limitations associated with onsite testing during clinical visits. Nucleic acid amplification tests can achieve both high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the three main infectious causes of vaginitis. In a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection compared with Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis, and compared with wet mount microscopy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and T vaginalis, while maintaining a comparable specificity. This work suggests that nucleic acid amplification tests are a diagnostic improvement over the traditional clinical algorithms largely used in settings such as primary care physician offices. The objective of this study was to determine the agreement of clinical diagnosis (standard of care) with a vaginal panel assay for diagnosis of vaginitis in a real-world setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^111oHhZ8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This was a multicenter, single-visit study comparing clinician diagnosis of vaginitis to CDC-recommended laboratory-based testing and an FDA-market authorized nucleic acid amplification assay. The primary objective of this study was to assess clinician diagnosis algorithms for women presenting with vaginitis and treatment(s) prescribed per standard of care within community practices. Additionally, participant outcomes following 90 days of the index visit were assessed to determine whether women returned with symptoms. The protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.

Between July 2017 and March 2018, 303 women aged 18–45 years were enrolled at 8 community-based practice clinics affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Women with 1 or more of the following symptoms: abnormal vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, vulvar or vaginal itch, vulvar discomfort (burning pain; irritation) were invited to participate if they provided written informed consent for the collection of 5 additional vaginal swabs, provided demographic and symptom data, and agreed to the extraction of limited data through the electronic medical record. Of the 303 samples received, 290 (96%) were evaluable; 4 were excluded because they were not received by the laboratory within 7 days, 4 were not correctly placed in the transport tubes, and 5 were excluded because the molecular testing was unresolved for 1 or more targets.

Participants provided their age, race, reason for visit, recent antibiotic and antifungal use, past and current genital symptoms, and pregnancy status, which was collected on a paper data collection form by clinic staff. The clinician performing the examination provided information on the diagnostic tests performed, the results of their point-of-care tests (pH, amine odor test, or microscopy, if performed), the presumptive diagnosis, and treatment (if any) prescribed on the day of the visit. The results of reference laboratory testing were not provided to the clinicians or the study participants. Participants were counseled and treated according to the discretion of the clinician and current practices at each site.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^113Qyic3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is clinically diagnosed by complaints of itching, burning, and odor accompanied by vaginal discharge. However, providing effective treatment is challenging because of limitations to accurately diagnose the cause of vaginitis at the time of a woman's visit. Conventional microscopy (Gram stain and wet mount), which is typically available in EDs, in addition to being time‐consuming, is strikingly insensitive for the diagnosis of BV, TV, and Candida, particularly with coinfections. For example, one study of 1740 women with vaginitis (BV, 783; Candida, 523; TV, 122; and mixed BV/ Candida, 185) comparing standard microscopy to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT; using reference standards of culture for TV and Candida and Nugent criteria for BV) reported sensitivities for microscopy to detect BV, TV, and Candida were 76.8%, 68.6%, and 56.9%, respectively. For NAAT, sensitivities were 92.8%, 96.5%, and 90.2%, respectively. Specificities for both microscopy and NAAT were generally > 90%. For microscopy detection of coinfections, sensitivities dropped to 10%–20%. Considering single and multiple infections, using microscopy, as many as one‐quarter to one‐half of infections are missed overall. CDC STI guidelines currently acknowledge microscopy's very poor sensitivity, recommending NAAT TV and Candida culture testing (or empirical treatment for Candida) if microscopy is negative.

### Pyomyoma after caesarean section: a rare entity [^115uedJc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Pyomyoma, a rare complication of a myoma undergoing infarction and subsequent infection, may be a diagnostic challenge in patients with unexplained puerperal fever. A woman in her 30s presented with fever and foul-smelling discharge per vaginum, 6 months after her first caesarean section (CS). She underwent an elective CS for symptomatic placenta praevia at 34 weeks of gestation. Intra-operatively, post-partum haemorrhage was managed with uterotonics and blood transfusions. However, 2weeks later, she developed a high-grade fever that was non-responsive to parenteral antibiotics. She continued to have intermittent episodes of high-grade fever, which were treated on an outpatient basis. Six months later, she developed purulent vaginal discharge, which grew Escherichia coli on bacterial culture. She received intravenous antibiotics and blood. Radiology confirmed the presence of a large fibroid with a focal capsular breach and peripherally enhanced collection extending to the endometrial cavity. The patient subsequently underwent a myomectomy. Intra-operatively, a large fundal myoma with endometrial breach and purulent discharge in the fibroid and endometrial cavity was noted. She sustained the procedure well and recovered uneventfully.

Discussion

In this study of 290 women seeking healthcare for symptoms of vaginitis, more than half had a laboratory-diagnosed condition, with 30% of women having BV, 34% having VVC, and 7% having TV based on laboratory testing. This study documents how infrequently CDC-recommended point-of-care testing, such as assessment of vaginal pH, microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, or the whiff test, is performed when women present with vaginal symptoms in primary women's healthcare settings. Similarly, low rates of evaluation have been reported among women referred for management of recurrent vaginitis.

Nearly half of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received 1 or more prescriptions that were inappropriate, and one-third of the 120 women without any of the known infectious causes of vaginitis were prescribed treatment inappropriately. Overall, 4 of 10 women seeking healthcare for symptoms of vaginitis in this study were prescribed inappropriate treatments. Return visits for symptoms of vaginitis were common, occurring over the next 3 months in 20% of the women. The frequency of return visits ranged from 17% of women with VVC, 35% of women having BV, and 42% of women with TV. Surprisingly, follow-up visits for vaginal symptoms were also common for women having no laboratory-diagnosed vaginitis at the index visit, with 12% of women returning with symptoms of vaginitis. The women who were treated empirically for vaginitis were significantly more likely to return in the subsequent 3 months vs those who were not treated (22% vs 6%, P = 0.02). Empiric treatment of women having symptoms of vaginitis is common and is perceived to cause no harm. However, these data suggest that empiric treatment of women having symptoms, but no infectious cause of vaginitis, may result in more symptom-triggered visits and a greater burden both for women and health systems.

### Management of persistent vaginitis [^116nKm9g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

With vaginitis remaining a common condition that leads women to seek care, it is not surprising that some women develop chronic vulvovaginal problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat. With a differential diagnosis that encompasses vulvar disorders and infectious and noninfectious causes of vaginitis, accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of choosing effective therapy. Evaluation should include a symptom-specific history, careful vulvar and vaginal examination, and office-based tests (vaginal pH, amine test, saline and 10% potassium hydroxide microscopy). Ancillary tests, especially yeast culture with speciation, are frequently crucial to obtaining a correct diagnosis. A heavy but normal physiologic discharge can be determined by excluding other causes. With vulvovaginal candidiasis, differentiating between Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida infection has important treatment ramifications. Most patients with C albicans infections can be successfully treated with maintenance antifungal therapy, usually with fluconazole. Although many non-albicans Candida, particularly Candida glabrata, may at times be innocent bystanders, vaginal boric acid therapy is an effective first choice for many true non-albicans Candida infections. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis, a difficult therapeutic challenge, can often be controlled with maintenance therapy. Multiple options, especially high-dose tinidazole, have been used for metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis. With the aging of the U.S. population, atrophic vaginitis and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, both associated with hypoestrogenism, are encountered frequently in women with persistent vaginitis.

### Assessment and treatment of vaginitis [^1166aRMr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is the presenting symptom at millions of office visits each year in the United States. Although treatment of sporadic cases is often straightforward, recurrent cases present both diagnostic and treatment challenges. Molecular diagnostic tests are likely superior to in-office microscopy for most clinicians and most cases. In both recurrent bacterial vaginosis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, national treatment guidelines recommend an extended treatment duration with one of the first-line agents. In cases in which such treatment is not successful, vaginal boric acid is likely the cheapest and easiest alternative option. New antifungal medications offer additional but limited treatment options. Probiotics are not recommended for prevention of vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, vaginal products containing Lactobacillus crispatus may have promise for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Trichomoniasis should be treated with a 1-week course of metronidazole; this is the only sexually transmitted infection for which treatment recommendations vary by sex. In cases in which patients do not respond to initial treatment, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, and other potential causes such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or vulvodynia should be considered.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^116WGqEg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — vaginal oxytocin: Two RCTs (n = 243) of vaginal oxytocin gel versus placebo yielded mixed results; one study showed improvement in vaginal discomfort or irritation, while another showed no significant improvement in self‑identified MBS at 12 weeks. No studies evaluated QoL or treatment satisfaction, and one trial showed significant improvement in sexual function after 8 weeks versus placebo. Serious adverse events included vaginal discharge, UTI, and vaginal odor, yet oxytocin may result in little to no difference in serious AEs compared to placebo, with no safety concerns regarding endometrial thickness. Vaginal oxytocin is not commercially available in the United States but may be obtained through compounding pharmacies, and the Panel was not able to make recommendations on its use.

### Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis as a cause of vaginal bleeding&discharge: a case report [^113gAogb]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepubertal vaginal bleeding is a common presentation for pediatric adolescent gynecologists with a broad differential diagnosis that historically may not have included complex lymphatic anomalies. However, given recent consensus criteria and imaging capabilities, this may be a condition that pediatric adolescent gynecologists see more frequently in the future.

Case

We present a case of a 5-year-old pre-pubertal girl whose only presenting symptoms of a rare complex lymphatic anomaly was copious vaginal bleeding. After three vaginoscopies, two hysteroscopies, two pelvic MRIs, and a percutaneous ultrasound guided core needle biopsy, this patient was eventually diagnosed with Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis at age 9 years-old, and she is now being treated medically with sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, with improvement in her symptoms.

Summary and Conclusion

Complex lymphatic anomalies should be considered after initial and secondary workups for pre-pubertal vaginal bleeding or copious vaginal discharge are negative. Furthermore, this case illustrates the value of pelvic MRI in the setting of unknown cause of vaginal bleeding when typical workup is negative.

### Vulvovaginal-STI treatment guidelines… [^11342oLa]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor or Discharge The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider. Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH is common with BV or trichomoniasis. Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.

9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis.
