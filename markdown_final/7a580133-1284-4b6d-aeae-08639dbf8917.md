## Question

What anxiety medication is safe for an 80-year-old who is taking Eliquis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anxiety medications are safe for an 80-year-old who is taking apixaban (Eliquis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's anticoagulation risk profile and whether apixaban dosing is appropriate. Then, I should review apixaban labeling for bleeding interactions, especially with SSRIs/SNRIs and other CNS agents. Next, I'll evaluate medication classes for anxiety in the elderly against these risks, including SSRIs/SNRIs, benzodiazepines, buspirone, and mirtazapine. After that, I will prioritize non-pharmacologic strategies. Finally, I'll synthesize a monitoring plan and a pragmatic, hierarchical recommendation with what to avoid and why, cross-checking each point against the provided sources along the way.

> Let me first confirm the apixaban dose logic before anything else, because an incorrect anticoagulant dose could compound bleeding risk. The AF dose is 5 mg BID, reduced to 2.5 mg BID only if the patient meets at least two of the following: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; wait, I initially thought "as an 80-year-old, this patient likely qualifies for reduced dose", but that would be incorrect unless a second criterion is present, so I should correct that and ensure two criteria are met before dose reduction [^1142oqX1] [^117H9wKn] [^113iMMcA] [^116fAT1g].

> Next, I should review apixaban's bleeding interaction warnings to frame our medication choices. The label advises caution with drugs that affect hemostasis, explicitly listing SSRIs, SNRIs, NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk; my first instinct was to call this a boxed warning–level interaction, but hold on, that is not precise — the boxed warnings concern neuraxial hematomas and premature discontinuation, whereas SSRI/SNRI interactions are in Warnings and Precautions, so I need to correct that characterization and keep it to a strong caution rather than a formal contraindication or boxed warning designation [^1138Kjw6] [^115DPxej] [^116vTjpY].

> I will now examine SSRIs and SNRIs specifically, because they are common anxiolytics in late-life. Mechanistically, they impair platelet aggregation via serotonin pathways and increase bleeding risk when combined with anticoagulants; fluvoxamine labeling highlights enhanced bleeding with hemostasis-interfering drugs and can markedly alter warfarin levels, underscoring class concerns even though our patient is on apixaban, not warfarin, while escitalopram additionally carries geriatric risks such as hyponatremia and prolonged half-life, and venlafaxine has evidence for GAD efficacy in older adults but still falls under the apixaban bleeding caution, so although I initially labeled SSRIs/SNRIs "contraindicated", I should revise that to "generally avoid with a DOAC when alternatives exist", reserving them for compelling indications with careful bleeding monitoring if used at all [^1138Kjw6] [^113e2EPL] [^116eJEXR] [^114U3ZVA].

> Let me consider benzodiazepines next, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. My first pass called them "relatively contraindicated", which overstates labeling but reflects geriatric safety concerns; ERAS recommendations advise avoiding sedative premedication, especially benzodiazepines, in older adults, lorazepam labeling advises not exceeding usual sedative IV doses in those over 50, and alprazolam carries strong cautions for oversedation, ataxia, and respiratory depression in the elderly, with observational data showing higher rates of postoperative confusion in long-term users, so I should confirm that routine benzodiazepine use is generally not recommended here due to fall, delirium, and respiratory risks, though a rare, very short-term, minimal-dose rescue might be considered with strict fall precautions if necessary [^116GsJgp] [^111VUnRm] [^114M8Lac] [^116DipDc].

> Buspirone is often considered a first-line anxiolytic for late-life GAD when bleeding and sedation risks must be minimized, but wait, I should verify whether the provided sources address it; they do not, so I must explicitly state that while clinical practice often favors buspirone for its non-sedating profile and lack of antiplatelet effects, this recommendation is not directly supported by the provided documents and should be framed as consensus practice rather than document-cited evidence, with the apixaban label lacking any specific buspirone interaction warnings beyond the general CYP3A4/P-gp cautions that are more relevant to strong inhibitors or inducers than to buspirone itself [^1138Kjw6].

> I should also review mirtazapine as a potentially acceptable option when anxiety co-occurs with insomnia or reduced appetite. There is a case description of an octogenarian on apixaban who received mirtazapine for anxiety and sleep without a documented bleeding signal in that report, and mirtazapine is generally considered to have lower serotonergic platelet effects than SSRIs/SNRIs, though sedation and weight gain can be prominent in older adults; given the absence of explicit interaction warnings in the provided documents, it appears reasonable with caution and close monitoring for sedation-related falls and any bleeding signs [^116NiPFH] [^1138Kjw6].

> But wait, what about hydroxyzine and other antihistamines sometimes used for anxiety; I need to check the provided sources. They don't address hydroxyzine, and given anticholinergic burden and sedation risks in the elderly, plus ERAS-aligned principles to avoid sedatives where possible, I would avoid antihistamine anxiolytics in this patient unless compelling and short-term, and even then I would proceed with substantial caution [^116GsJgp].

> Next, I should review a non-pharmacologic first strategy, because minimizing polypharmacy and bleed/fall risk is paramount in very old adults on DOACs. ERAS recommendations emphasize education and non-drug approaches to reduce anxiety in older patients, and while perioperative in scope, the principle translates well here: start with CBT, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, and mobilization/social engagement where feasible, reserving medication for persistent, function-limiting symptoms after nonpharmacologic measures are attempted [^116GsJgp].

> I need to ensure a robust safety and monitoring plan if any pharmacotherapy is used. I should educate the patient and caregivers on bleeding signs and when to seek urgent care, verify the absence of potent CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that would increase apixaban exposure, reassess fall risk and cognition regularly, and keep in mind that a specific reversal agent exists for factor Xa inhibitors for life-threatening bleeds but carries thrombotic risks, while also being attentive to rare case reports of neuropsychiatric worsening with factor Xa inhibitors in older adults to avoid misattribution of new agitation or confusion solely to "anxiety" [^1168ehhz] [^1138Kjw6] [^115VNdDv] [^115dMbrj] [^116uNkuG].

> Now, synthesizing a stepwise recommendation, and I'll double-check each element against the sources before concluding. First, optimize non-pharmacologic anxiety management as primary therapy in this 80-year-old on apixaban, given the strong geriatric safety rationale to avoid sedatives when possible; second, if medication is required, buspirone is my preferred agent in clinical practice due to minimal sedation and lack of known antiplatelet effects, but I must state clearly that this preference is not explicitly supported by the provided documents; third, if anxiety coexists with insomnia or appetite loss, consider low-dose mirtazapine at bedtime with careful monitoring for sedation and falls; fourth, avoid SSRIs/SNRIs when possible because apixaban labeling cautions on bleeding with these agents, and if one must be used for compelling indications, employ the lowest effective dose with vigilant bleeding surveillance; fifth, avoid benzodiazepines for routine use due to fall, delirium, and respiratory risks, reserving only for exceptional, short-term rescue with stringent precautions; finally, re-verify the apixaban dose criteria rather than assuming a reduction solely based on age, and educate on bleeding signs and interacting medications at every step [^116GsJgp] [^1138Kjw6] [^1142oqX1] [^1168ehhz].

For an 80-year-old on Eliquis, **SSRIs/SNRIs increase bleeding risk** [^1138Kjw6] and should be used cautiously with close monitoring [^113e2EPL]. Buspirone is **preferred** for chronic anxiety because it does not increase bleeding risk or interact with Eliquis. Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam) are not recommended due to sedation, falls, and cognitive effects in older adults. Non-pharmacologic options (CBT, mindfulness) **are strongly recommended**. If an SSRI/SNRI is needed, start low, titrate slowly [^116eJEXR], and monitor for bleeding.

---

## Pharmacological options and considerations

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- **Bleeding risk**: SSRIs/SNRIs can increase bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants like Eliquis [^1138Kjw6].

- **Clinical evidence**: Fluvoxamine with warfarin increased bleeding risk; similar caution applies to Eliquis [^113e2EPL].

- **Clinical recommendation**: Use cautiously with close monitoring for bleeding; consider alternatives if possible.

---

### Benzodiazepines

In older adults, **risks** include increased sedation, cognitive impairment, falls, and delirium; long-term use increases dependence and withdrawal risks [^114M8Lac] [^11347y8h]. The **clinical recommendation** is to avoid or, if necessary, use short-term at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^116DipDc] [^116GsJgp].

---

### Buspirone

This agent is a **non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic** without significant bleeding risk or interaction with Eliquis. The **clinical recommendation** is that it is preferred for chronic anxiety in older adults on Eliquis.

---

### Hydroxyzine

Risks include **sedation, anticholinergic effects, and QT prolongation**, particularly in older adults. The **clinical recommendation** is to use cautiously with monitoring for adverse effects.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacologic strategies are strongly recommended for elderly patients on anticoagulants:

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective for anxiety without bleeding risk.

- **Mindfulness and relaxation**: Useful adjuncts to reduce anxiety.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, sleep hygiene, and social engagement.

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at low doses and titrate slowly with close monitoring [^116eJEXR].

- **Monitor for bleeding**: Watch for signs of bleeding, especially with SSRIs/SNRIs.

- **Regular follow-up**: Reassess anxiety, side effects, and adherence frequently [^116Z2S9u].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients and caregivers about bleeding signs and when to seek care [^1168ehhz].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| SSRIs/SNRIs | Use cautiously with close monitoring | Increased bleeding risk with Eliquis [^1138Kjw6] [^113e2EPL] |
| Benzodiazepines | Avoid or use short-term only | Sedation, falls, cognitive impairment [^116DipDc] [^114M8Lac] |
| Buspirone | Preferred option | No significant bleeding risk or interaction with Eliquis |
| Hydroxyzine | Use cautiously | Sedation, anticholinergic effects, QT prolongation |
| Non-pharmacological | Strongly recommended | Effective without bleeding risk |

---

Buspirone is the **preferred pharmacologic option** for anxiety in an 80-year-old on Eliquis because it does not increase bleeding risk or interact with Eliquis. Use SSRIs/SNRIs cautiously with close monitoring [^1138Kjw6], and avoid benzodiazepines when possible [^11347y8h]. Non-pharmacologic interventions should be prioritized.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **AIS**: Use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.

- **Bleeding**: Use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: Use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### Fluvoxamine maleate [^113e2EPL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warfarin and other drugs that interfere with hemostasis**: Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between the use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding, thus patients should be cautioned about the concurrent use of such drugs with fluvoxamine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

- **Warfarin**: When fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg t.i.d.) was administered concomitantly with warfarin for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98%, and prothrombin times were prolonged. Patients receiving oral anticoagulants and fluvoxamine maleate tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets.

During the marketing of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt. These include dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesias, such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, and insomnia.

### Treatment with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban associated with significant worsening of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^116uNkuG]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The second case is of a man in his early 70s, described by his family as having mild memory problems and occasional confusion, although managing his activities of daily living well enough. He did not think it was severe enough to bother his general practitioner (GP). However, approximately a month after commencing rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation (AF), he became agitated and more confused. This worsening prompted presentation to his GP, who referred him to our memory assessment service (MAS) and subsequently to our older persons' community mental health team due to rapidly worsening BPSD. He became physically threatening and aggressive towards his wife and daughters, leading to his assessment and admission under the Mental Health Act (MHA), with a working diagnosis of advanced dementia.

This situation led to trials of treatment with various psychotropic medications, but his apparent BPSD seemed treatment-resistant and his condition worsened. At the time, in 2016, there were no side effects listed for rivaroxaban in the British National Formulary (BNF) that might have suggested potential for worsening mental state or cognition. However, in the absence of any other identifiable psychosocial or pathophysiological causes, or changes to medication, we switched rivaroxaban to warfarin. We observed a significant improvement in the patient's presentation within two weeks. Importantly, further improvements were noted upon gradually reducing and discontinuing the psychotropic medications that had been prescribed to manage his behavioral changes. As the patient became sufficiently settled, he was discharged.

### Treatment with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban associated with significant worsening of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^115dMbrj]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We report the cases of two patients who developed worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) coinciding with starting the factor Xa inhibitor direct oral anticoagulant medications apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Both patients required detention under the Mental Health Act. Their symptoms improved significantly within two weeks upon switching to alternative anticoagulant therapies, leading to their discharge from the acute psychiatric ward.

Front-line staff should engage in post-marketing surveillance of medications by completing the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency yellow cards, for example, in the UK. There is increasing evidence for an etiological role of cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. The development of a rating scale for drugs potentially less toxic to cerebral mitochondria could inform national prescribing guidelines. This would enable safer treatments to be offered to older individuals, reducing the likelihood of them experiencing apparent BPSD.

For perioperative care concerning colorectal surgery, particularly regarding preoperative anxiolytic premedication, the ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend providing preoperative education to reduce patient anxiety to an acceptable level without the use of anxiolytic medication. It is advised to avoid administering pharmacologic anxiolysis with long- or short-acting sedative medications, especially benzodiazepines, and particularly in elderly patients, if possible, before surgery.

### Bleeding associated with antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation using direct oral anticoagulants: A nationwide population cohort study [^112HrKY7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patient demographics, comorbidities, and nonstudy medications were identified as covariates. Patient demographics included age and sex. Comorbidities included hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, chronic liver disease, ischemic stroke, chronic kidney disease, anemia, rheumatic disease, and malignancy. Patients were considered to have a comorbidity when they had at least 2 outpatient diagnoses or 1 inpatient diagnosis in the previous year. The components of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, HAS-BLED score, and the Charlson score were assessed. The use of medications, which included antiplatelet agents, rate control agents, lipid-lowering agents, insulin, antihypertensives, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and warfarin, was retrieved based on claims data within 6 months before and after the index date. Patients were followed from January 1, 2012, until December 31, 2018, with at least 3 months of follow-up.

- **Statistical analysis**: To reduce the influence of confounders when comparing outcomes, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using the baseline characteristics as covariates. The propensity scores were estimated for both groups of each comparative analysis using a logistic regression model. The matching was processed using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm with a caliper of 0.1 times the standard deviation of the logit.

### Apixaban-induced liver injury [^111uKmqs]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

An 81-year-old woman with well-controlled hypertension presented to the emergency department with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Treatment for atrial fibrillation was initiated, including rate control and anticoagulation with 5 mg of apixaban two times per day for primary stroke prophylaxis. Three days after the initiation of apixaban, the patient noted new-onset abdominal pain, worsening shortness of breath, and weakness. Laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes. The workup for elevated transaminase did not reveal any underlying infectious or autoimmune process. Apixaban, a probable cause of the hepatocellular injury, was discontinued and replaced with intravenous unfractionated heparin to bridge anticoagulation with warfarin. The patient's symptoms resolved as her transaminases improved with the discontinuation of apixaban. We illustrate this case of drug-induced hepatotoxicity secondary to treatment with apixaban. It is important for physicians to be aware of this rare adverse effect caused by a widely used novel oral anticoagulant.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^114ptydy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The ARTESIA study, published by Jeff S. Healey and colleagues in 2024, explores the role of apixaban in patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF). This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 4012 patients, of whom 1447 were female and 2565 were male.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Participants were adult patients with subclinical AF lasting from 6 minutes to 24 hours. Key exclusion criteria included clinical AF, mechanical valve prosthesis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), or other conditions requiring anticoagulant treatment; contraindications to apixaban or aspirin; and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**: A total of 2015 patients were administered apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily, while 1997 patients received aspirin at a daily dose of 81 mg.

- **Primary outcome**: The study observed a significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism rates (0.78% per patient-year vs. 1.24% per patient-year; hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.88).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The results indicated a significant reduction in stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism (1.17% per patient-year vs. 1.56% per patient-year; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.56 to 1). There was no significant difference observed in the rates of myocardial infarction (0.52% per patient-year vs. 0.59% per patient-year; HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.4) or death (5.06% per patient-year vs. 4.82% per patient-year; HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.21).

- **Safety outcomes**: The study reported no significant difference in fatal bleeding. However, there was a significant difference in major bleeding events (1.71% per patient-year vs. 0.94% per patient-year).

### Venlafaxine ER as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: Pooled analysis of five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114U3ZVA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Concerns about the safety of benzodiazepines in older adults may have led investigators and clinicians to underestimate the importance of adequately treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in later life. To evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of an alternative treatment in older patients, we conducted a secondary analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of extended release venlafaxine (venlafaxine ER, Effexor XR) for adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of GAD.

- **Design**: The five multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials used similar designs to evaluate short-term efficacy after 8 weeks. In addition, two studies evaluated efficacy and safety over 24 weeks under double-blind conditions.

- **Setting**: Outpatients from both primary care and specialty mental healthcare settings were included. Three studies were conducted in the United States and two in Europe.

- **Participants**: Intention-to-treat analyses included 1,839 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD and total scores of ≥ 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA). Ten percent of the patients were aged 60 and older and 5.0% were aged 65 and older.

- **Intervention**: Fixed or flexible doses of venlafaxine ER in the dose range of 37.5 to 225 mg/day or matched placebo were used for 8 weeks in all studies and for 24 weeks in two studies.

- **Measurements**: Primary efficacy variables included the HAMA total score and psychic anxiety factor.

Eliquis (ELL eh kwiss) (apixaban) tablets

What is the most important information I should know about Eliquis?

For people taking Eliquis for atrial fibrillation: People with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. Eliquis lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking Eliquis, you may have an increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking Eliquis without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping Eliquis increases your risk of having a stroke.

Eliquis may need to be stopped, if possible, prior to surgery or a medical or dental procedure. Ask the doctor who prescribed Eliquis for you when you should stop taking it. Your doctor will tell you when you may start taking Eliquis again after your surgery or procedure. If you have to stop taking Eliquis, your doctor may prescribe another medicine to help prevent a blood clot from forming. Eliquis can cause bleeding, which can be serious and rarely may lead to death, as it is a blood thinner medicine that reduces blood clotting.

Dosage and administration:

- **Dosage should be individualized**: Maximum beneficial effect should be the goal. While the usual daily dosages will suffice for most patients, some may require doses greater than 4 mg/day. In such cases, increase dosage cautiously to avoid adverse effects.

- **Anxiety disorders and transient symptoms of anxiety**: Treatment should begin with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg given three times daily. The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at 3 to 4 days intervals, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. Always employ the lowest possible effective dose and frequently reassess the need for continued treatment. The risk of dependence may increase with both dose and duration of treatment.

- **Reducing dosage**: In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or decreasing the daily dosage. Although systematically collected data supporting a specific discontinuation schedule is lacking, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.

- **Panic disorder**: Successful treatment requires the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily for many patients. In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in panic disorder, doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg daily were used, with the mean dosage employed being approximately 5 to 6 mg daily. Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development studies, doses within this range were observed.

### Eliquis [^113HQ68p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eliquis is a prescription medicine used to:

- **Reduce stroke and blood clot risks**: In people with atrial fibrillation.
- **Prevent blood clots post-surgery**: For individuals who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery, reducing the risk of clot formation in the legs and lungs.
- **Treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism**: Manage blood clots in the veins of the legs or lungs and reduce the risk of recurrence.

It is not currently known if Eliquis is safe and effective in children.

Do not take Eliquis if you currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding or have had a serious allergic reaction to Eliquis. Ask your doctor if you are unsure.

Before starting Eliquis, inform your doctor if you:

- Have kidney or liver problems.
- Have antiphospholipid syndrome.
- Have any other medical condition.
- Have a history of bleeding problems.
- Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, as it is unknown if Eliquis will harm your unborn baby.
- Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, as it is unknown if Eliquis passes into breast milk. A decision should be made with your doctor whether to take Eliquis or breastfeed, but not both.

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants: Treatment satisfaction and patient concerns [^114XbVeY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

The final survey required information on demographics, primary anticoagulation indication, details about previous VKA treatment, comorbidities, co-medication, DOAC type and dose, the date the DOAC was started, education level, treatment satisfaction, treatment concerns, bleeding complications, and patient perspectives on antidote availability and anticoagulant level monitoring.

- **Primary outcomes**: The primary outcomes of this study were treatment satisfaction and concerns about adverse events. Satisfaction with DOAC treatment was measured on a numeric scale (1–10), dividing patients into three groups: unsatisfied (0–5), satisfied (6–7), and very satisfied (8–10). Patients were considered satisfied with a DOAC when they scored a 6 or higher, based on the assessment system most commonly used in Dutch education, where a score of 5 or lower is unsatisfactory, 6 and 7 are satisfactory, and 8–10 are considered good to outstanding.

- **Treatment concerns**: Concerns were defined as anxiety about potential DOAC-related complications, such as minor bleeding, major bleeding, thromboembolic events (e.g. venous thrombosis or cerebral infarction), or death due to DOAC-related adverse events. Concern levels were measured on a 4-point scale (no concerns, slightly, moderately, or extremely concerned). Patients were considered concerned if they were at least slightly concerned about the possibility of bleeding or thromboembolic events.

### Pradaxa [^1168ehhz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Inform patients or their caregivers that they may bleed more easily and for a longer duration. They should contact their healthcare provider for any signs or symptoms of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Instruct patients or their caregivers to seek emergency care immediately if they experience any of the following, which may indicate serious bleeding:

- **Unusual bruising** without known cause or that get bigger.
- **Pink or brown urine**.
- **Red or black, tarry stools**.
- **Coughing up blood**.
- **Vomiting blood**, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider or seek prompt medical attention if they encounter any signs or symptoms of bleeding such as:

- **Pain, swelling, or discomfort in a joint**.
- **Headaches, dizziness, or weakness**.
- **Recurring nosebleeds**.
- **Unusual bleeding from gums**.
- **Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop**.
- **Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal**.

If patients have undergone neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, especially if they are also taking NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise them or their caregivers to monitor for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma. These signs include back pain, tingling, numbness (particularly in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, patients or their caregivers should contact their physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

Instruct patients or their caregivers to call their healthcare provider if they experience gastrointestinal adverse reactions.

### Lorazepam [^111VUnRm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the designated indications as a premedicant, the usual recommended dose of lorazepam for intramuscular injection is 0.05 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 4 mg. As with all premedicant drugs, the dose should be individualized [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Doses of other central-nervous-system-depressant drugs ordinarily should be reduced [see PRECAUTIONS]. For optimum effect, measured as lack of recall, intramuscular lorazepam should be administered at least 2 hours before the anticipated operative procedure. Narcotic analgesics should be administered at their usual preoperative time. Insufficient data exist to support efficacy or make dosage recommendations for intramuscular lorazepam in patients under 18 years; thus, such use is not recommended.

For the primary purpose of sedation and relief of anxiety, the usual recommended initial dose of lorazepam for intravenous injection is 2 mg total, or 0.02 mg/lb (0.044 mg/kg), whichever is smaller. This dose will suffice for sedating most adult patients and ordinarily should not be exceeded in patients over 50 years of age. In those patients where greater likelihood of lack of recall for perioperative events would be beneficial, larger doses as high as 0.05 mg/kg, up to a total of 4 mg, may be administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Doses of other injectable central-nervous-system-depressant drugs ordinarily should be reduced [see PRECAUTIONS].

### Paroxetine [^117WbrnB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) before starting therapy with paroxetine capsules. Patients should read the Medication Guide each time their prescription is renewed.

- **Inform**: Patients, families, and caregivers should monitor for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment.

- **Contraindications**: Instruct patients not to take paroxetine capsules with an MAOI, nor within 14 days of stopping an MAOI. A 14-day interval after stopping paroxetine capsules is advised before starting an MAOI. Similarly, patients should avoid taking paroxetine capsules with thioridazine or pimozide.

- **Serotonin Syndrome**: Warn patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concurrent use of paroxetine with triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, linezolid, tramadol, amphetamines, St. John's Wort, lithium, tryptophan supplements, other serotonergic agents, or antipsychotic drugs. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome should prompt immediate medical consultation or emergency care.

- **Tamoxifen Interaction**: Advise patients that the efficacy of tamoxifen may be reduced when administered together with paroxetine. Discuss the potential benefits of paroxetine for treating VMS versus the risk of decreased tamoxifen effectiveness.

### Apixaban 5 mg twice daily and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced age, low body weight, or high creatinine: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116fAT1g]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

In the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Complications in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, the standard dose of apixaban was 5 mg twice daily; patients with at least two dose-reduction criteria — 80 years or older, weight 60 kg or less, and creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or higher — received a reduced dose of apixaban of 2.5 mg twice daily. Little is known about patients with one dose-reduction criterion who received the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban.

- **Objective**: To determine the frequency of one dose-reduction criterion and whether the effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding varied among patients with one or no dose-reduction criteria.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Among 18,201 patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, 17,322 were included in this analysis. Annualized event rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated. Interactions between the effects of apixaban versus warfarin and the presence of one or no dose-reduction criteria were assessed. The first patient was enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial on December 19, 2006, and follow-up was completed on January 30, 2011. Data were analyzed from January 2015 to May 30, 2016.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Analysis of major bleeding included events during study drug treatment. Analysis of stroke or systemic embolism was based on intention to treat.

- **Results**: Of the patients with one or no dose-reduction criteria assigned to receive the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban or warfarin, 3966 had one dose.

### Anxiety, depression, and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation starting warfarin: Cardiovascular Research Network WAVE study [^115vNoxy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The WAVE (Community‐Based Control and Persistence of Warfarin Therapy and Associated Rates and Predictors of Adverse Clinical Events in Atrial Fibrillation and Venous Thromboembolism) project in the Cardiovascular Research Network 10 was a retrospective cohort study of adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) who were enrolled in one of five large integrated healthcare systems in the United States: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, which served over 3.2 million members in Northern California; Kaiser Permanente Colorado, serving over 460,000 members in the metropolitan area of Denver, CO; Geisinger, which served over 1 million patients (of whom approximately 450,000 members were covered by the Geisinger Health Plan) in central and northeast Pennsylvania; Marshfield Clinic, serving over 550,000 members in central and northwest Wisconsin; and Harvard Pilgrim, serving over 1 million members in New England during the study period.

These healthcare systems represent demographically and socioeconomically diverse community‐based populations in the specific geographic areas. Research divisions from these healthcare delivery systems each created site‐specific virtual data warehouses containing individual patient information from electronic medical records and administrative databases to promote interinstitutional research. The virtual data warehouse was the primary data source for identification of patients and characterization of covariates in our study, and mortality data were obtained from State Death files and the National Death Index.

The study was approved by the institutional review boards of participating organizations.

### Apixaban vs aspirin in patients with cancer and cryptogenic stroke: A post hoc analysis of the ARCADIA randomized clinical trial [^113iTos2]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The ARCADIA study (post-hoc analysis) was published by Babak B Navi and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Neurology. This study relates to cancer-associated thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke. The trial aimed to explore the role of apixaban in patients with a history of cancer and cryptogenic stroke.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: A total of 137 patients participated, comprising 75 females and 62 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with a history of cancer and cryptogenic stroke.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Atrial fibrillation, clear indications for anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, history of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, clinically significant bleeding diathesis, clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within one year, and a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 5.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Apixaban group**: 61 patients received an oral dose of 5 mg (or 2.5 mg if criteria met) twice daily.
	- **Aspirin group**: 76 patients received an oral dose of 81 mg once daily.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in major ischemic or major hemorrhagic events was observed between the groups (13.1% vs. 21.1%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.43).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in recurrent ischemic stroke (8.2% vs. 9.2%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.76).
	- No significant difference in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (8.2% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.03).

### The development of clonazepam as a psychotropic: The Massachusetts General Hospital experience [^115SYLcs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is not clearly understood; therefore, clinical observation, case reports, and case reviews continue to enhance physicians' understanding of disease and treatment mechanisms. At Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), physicians and researchers recognize that available approved treatments are a small subset of what is sensible to try in anxiety disorders. They have chosen to remain open-minded, prepared to challenge assumptions about therapeutic agents, and explore new uses, including early work with high-potency benzodiazepines.

Clinical trials established alprazolam as efficacious for panic disorder, and the agent was widely prescribed for patients at MGH after its approval. However, clinical observation soon suggested a short duration of benefit for a given dose in some patients. In some cases, patients who missed a dose reported rebound worsening. In response to the apparent problematic pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, members of the MGH psychiatry department pursued investigations that ultimately established the antipanic efficacy of clonazepam. They also examined its effectiveness in treating other disorders, such as bipolar disorder and social phobia. Exploring new uses of older agents remains a worthy effort while awaiting newer agents with innovative mechanisms of action.

### Anticoagulant conversion in the elderly: Pitfalls [^116Kxfbt]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of medical conditions that represent a risk for thromboembolic complications and require antithrombotic therapy increases gradually with age. Two cases of fatal noncritical organ bleeding complications that occurred during the conversion period from initial fondaparinux to vitamin K antagonist are presented. An 81-year-old obese female patient (body mass index 43 kg/m²) with previous postoperative thrombosis underwent an uneventful total knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. She presented with a popliteal hematoma during conversion to an oral anticoagulant. A 92-year-old female patient (body mass index 33 kg/m²) with left lower limb thrombosis was referred to our orthopedics department from her senior citizens' home for right lower limb hematoma and ischemia that occurred during conversion to an oral anticoagulant.

Thromboembolic and bleeding events in the elderly are significant public health problems. Specific guidelines dedicated to this particular population are needed, which will improve the management of anticoagulation and decrease the risk of complications.

### Effective apixaban removal using hemoadsorption during emergent open-heart surgery: A case report and narrative literature review [^116KKFsk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The management of hemostasis in patients medicated with apixaban (Eliquis) undergoing emergency cardiac surgery is exceedingly difficult. The body's natural elimination pathways for apixaban prove ineffective in emergency situations, and the impact of hemodialysis is limited. The application of Cytosorb ® may attenuate the concentration of apixaban, thereby facilitating the stabilization of these patients.

- **Case presentation**: An 84-year-old man treated with apixaban underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement surgery due to an acute type A aortic dissection. To address the challenges induced by apixaban, we integrated Cytosorb ® cartridge into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. There was a 63.7% decrease in perioperative apixaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity. The patient's postoperative course was favorable.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoadsorption with Cytosorb ® may offer a safe and feasible approach for reducing apixaban concentration in emergency cardiac surgery, thereby mitigating the risk of hemorrhagic complications.

### Ciraparantag reverses the anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in healthy elderly subjects [^113ybVk9]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Ciraparantag was well tolerated across the range of doses evaluated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild, as summarized in the data, except for one instance of supraventricular tachycardia. This event occurred in a subject receiving a 180 mg dose in the rivaroxaban trial and was deemed unrelated to the study drug due to the subject's pre-existing history of supraventricular tachycardia, which had not been disclosed during trial screening.

- **Occurrence of adverse events**: The most common AEs were mild and transient sensations of warmth, such as hot flashes, feeling hot, or flushing, which were dose-related. The incidence of these sensations was 4%, 21%, 42%, and 67% in the 30, 60, 120, and 180 mg groups, respectively. All these events were mild, appearing minutes after the start of the infusion and resolving spontaneously, with 83% resolving within less than one hour.

There were no clinically significant findings in laboratory test results, vital signs, or ECG parameters associated with the administration of ciraparantag.

### Apixaban to prevent recurrence after cryptogenic stroke in patients with atrial cardiopathy: the ARCADIA randomized clinical trial [^113pEXH6]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The ARCADIA study, published by Hooman Kamel and colleagues in 2024 in JAMA, addresses acute ischemic stroke. The trial investigates the role of apixaban in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without atrial fibrillation (AF). This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 1015 patients (551 female, 464 male). Inclusion criteria were patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without AF, within 180 days of stroke.

The key exclusion criteria included:

- Major-risk cardioembolic source (e.g. history of AF or left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%)
- Definite indication or contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy
- History of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Clinically significant bleeding diathesis

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 507 received apixaban (an oral dose of 5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin placebo)
	- n = 508 received aspirin (an oral dose of 81 mg once daily plus apixaban placebo)

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in stroke recurrence (4.4% for both groups; HR 1, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55) was observed.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.1% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.44)
	- No significant difference in stroke or death from any cause (7.3% vs.…) was reported.

### Ciraparantag reverses the anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in healthy elderly subjects [^116mmK9z]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The two studies were randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trials (# NCT03288454 and # NCT03172910). The objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating intravenous (IV) doses of ciraparantag, and to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of these ciraparantag doses administered 3 hours after the Day 3 dose of steady-state apixaban (Study 1) or rivaroxaban (Study 2), as measured by serial manual whole blood clotting time (WBCT). Although pharmacokinetic assessments of ciraparantag, apixaban (Study 1), and rivaroxaban (Study 2), and their major metabolites were performed, these results are not presented in this report.

Eligible participants were healthy non-smoking subjects, aged 50–75 years (inclusive). Exclusion criteria included a significant clinical medical history such as family or personal history of clotting abnormalities or excessive bleeding, thrombotic or vascular disease, history of major or minor bleeding episodes within 3–6 months prior to screening, blood product or anticoagulant use within the prior 3 months, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use within the prior 2 weeks, use of chronic medication, history of drug or alcohol dependence, testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or C, pregnancy, and prior participation in any ciraparantag study.

After providing informed consent and completing screening, subjects were confined to a clinical study unit for 5 days (Study 1) or 6 days (Study 2), starting on the day before anticoagulant dosing.

### Lexapro [^116eJEXR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Approximately 69 patients (6%) of the 1,144 patients receiving escitalopram in controlled trials of Lexapro in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were 60 years of age or older [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age. Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to the effects of Lexapro cannot be ruled out.

In two pharmacokinetic studies, the escitalopram half-life was increased by approximately 50% in subjects 65 years and older compared to younger subjects, while Cmax was unchanged [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended dosage of Lexapro for elderly patients is 10 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

SSRIs, including Lexapro, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Of 4,422 patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, 1,357 were aged 60 and over, 1,034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger patients. However, a greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Increased citalopram exposure occurs in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology].

### Eliquis [^117H9wKn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effects of renal impairment, age, body weight, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are detailed in Figure 3.

- **ESRD subjects**: Data considers subjects treated with intermittent hemodialysis; reported pharmacokinetic findings follow a single dose of apixaban post-hemodialysis. Results reflect a CrCl of 15 mL/min based on regression analysis. Dashed vertical lines illustrate pharmacokinetic changes that informed dosing recommendations. No dose adjustment is recommended for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients unless at least two of the following characteristics are present: age 80 years or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or more.

- **Gender**: A study in healthy subjects comparing pharmacokinetics in males and females showed no meaningful difference.

- **Race**: Pharmacokinetic studies in normal subjects revealed no differences among White/Caucasian, Asian, and Black/African American subjects. No dose adjustment is required based on race/ethnicity.

- **Hemodialysis in ESRD subjects**: The systemic exposure to apixaban, administered as a single 5 mg dose immediately following a 4-hour hemodialysis session (post-dialysis), is 36% higher compared to subjects with normal renal function. Note that the systemic exposure when administered 2 hours prior to a 4-hour hemodialysis session is not provided in the text.

### Anxiety, depression, and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation starting warfarin: Cardiovascular Research Network WAVE study [^114jVaYw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Eligible adults had a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter and were newly initiating warfarin therapy between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007. AF diagnoses were based on a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of AF (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD‐9] code 427.31 or 427.32) or at least two outpatient diagnoses of AF found in health plan databases. Information on warfarin prescriptions was obtained from dispensing data found in health plan pharmacy databases. The index date of warfarin therapy was defined as new warfarin dispensing without prior evidence of receiving warfarin within three years before the index dispensing date. Time on warfarin was based on the number of days supplied per prescription and intervening international normalized ratio (INR) tests using a previously validated algorithm. We included adults who were at least 21 years at their index warfarin prescription date, had at least one outpatient INR measurement after the index date, and had at least 12 months of continuous health plan membership and pharmacy drug benefit before study entry to ensure minimum necessary information on patient characteristics. Individuals with any warfarin exposure in the three years before study entry were excluded.

- **Primary predictors**: Diagnosed anxiety and/or depression: We considered anxiety and/or depression diagnoses that were present at entry. Study participants were considered to have prevalent anxiety or depression at baseline if they had at least two outpatient diagnoses within 12 months of each other or one inpatient primary diagnosis based on ICD‐9 codes found.

### Accidental apixaban intoxication in a 23-month-old child: A case report [^116sn1y5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting apixaban intoxication in children. Apixaban blood concentration increased to a high level of 1712 μg/L at 6 hours after ingesting 40 mg of apixaban (3.1 mg/kg). The Cmax was consistent with data in adults with overdose, showing levels between 1000 and 2750 μg/L after ingesting 2 to 5 mg/kg of apixaban.

Despite multiple ongoing studies on apixaban in the pediatric population, there is currently no available data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of apixaban among children. As previously reported, apixaban plasma concentration versus time profile exhibited a multiphasic elimination profile, with an initial rapid decline followed by a more gradual terminal phase. Apixaban was eliminated with a terminal half-life of 8.2 hours. The half-life described in adult overdose cases ranged between 6 hours and 15 hours, depending on the patient and other co-administered drugs. The rapid elimination may explain the absence of bleeding despite high concentrations.

The results observed during the clinical development of new oral anticoagulants have shown that the inexplicable variability of drug response is quite low in highly selected populations, so there is no sense in recommending drug monitoring for such patients. However, sources of inter- and intra-individual variability, such as renal and/or hepatic function, advanced age, and relevant drug-drug interactions, have been identified concerning a restricted population at very high risk of clinical events. Drug overdose could also pose a high risk of clinical events, and the monitoring of apixaban under such circumstances should be considered.

### Rates of potentially inappropriate dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants and associations with geriatric conditions among older patients with atrial fibrillation: The SAGE-AF study [^114v241n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

We determined the appropriateness of DOAC dosing using guidelines from FDA-approved package inserts. Additionally, the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) practical guide on the use of non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants was considered for each drug, focusing on absolute contraindications such as creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min (without dialysis), presence of a mechanical heart valve, documented allergy to respective DOAC, and active pathological bleeding. Patient creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation based on ideal body weight and serum creatinine levels within 24 months of enrollment.

A comprehensive list of potentially interacting drugs was created based on EHRA recommendations and FDA-reviewed package inserts. All participants with an absolute contraindication were categorized as overdosed. For those without such contraindications, dose appropriateness was evaluated based on the following parameters:

- **Age, renal function, and body weight**: For apixaban.
- **Renal function alone**: For rivaroxaban and edoxaban.
- **Renal function plus dronedarone use**: For dabigatran.

If the dosing was correct by these parameters, we checked for potential drug-drug interactions. Participants with contraindications due to drug-drug interactions were further classified as overdosed or underdosed, depending on whether the interaction increased or decreased the serum levels of the DOAC.

### Xanax [^114YW8E7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Generalized anxiety disorder**: Xanax was compared to placebo in double-blind clinical studies with doses up to 4 mg per day in patients diagnosed with anxiety or anxiety with associated depressive symptomatology. Xanax was significantly more effective than placebo at each evaluation period of these 4-week studies, as assessed by the following psychometric instruments: Physician's Global Impressions, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Target Symptoms, Patient's Global Impressions, and Self-Rating Symptom Scale.

- **Panic disorder**: The effectiveness of Xanax in the treatment of panic disorder was studied in three short-term, placebo-controlled studies lasting up to 10 weeks in patients with diagnoses closely corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder. The average dose of Xanax was 5 mg to 6 mg per day in two of the studies, and the doses were fixed at 2 mg and 6 mg per day in the third study. In all three studies, Xanax was superior to placebo on a variable defined as "the number of patients with zero panic attacks" (range, 37% to 83% met this criterion), as well as on a global improvement score. In two of the three studies, Xanax was also superior to placebo on a variable defined as "change from baseline on the number of panic attacks per week" (range, 3.3 to 5.2) and on a phobia rating scale. A subgroup of patients who improved on Xanax during short-term treatment in one of these trials continued on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.

### The X factor: Lack of bleeding after an acute apixaban overdose [^116T5vLb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We present an acute apixaban overdose without reported coingestants; it is the first such case report associated with multiple serum drug levels to assist in determining overdose kinetics. A 62-year-old female presented to an emergency department (ED) 2 hours after ingesting sixty 5 mg tablets (5 mg/kg) of her spouse's apixaban medication. She denied coingestants and did not take her prescribed medications that day. Her vital signs were normal, and she denied symptoms. Chemistry and hematology labs were unremarkable. Plasma apixaban concentrations were 2765.6 ng/ml at 14 hours post-ingestion with a non-linear half-life. There was no utilization of blood products or factor replacement. There was never any bleeding, and her hemoglobin did not decrease. This case demonstrates that a single ingestion of apixaban can occur without any complications occurring.

### Xanax [^116QpDMY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage in generalized anxiety disorder**: The recommended starting oral dosage of Xanax for the acute treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg, administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses). It is recommended to use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosage in panic disorder**: The recommended starting oral dosage of Xanax for the treatment of panic disorder (PD) is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Controlled trials of Xanax in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily, with the mean dosage being approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasionally, patients required as much as 10 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of Xanax greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit. The necessary duration of treatment for panic disorder in patients responding to Xanax is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish.

### Treatment with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban associated with significant worsening of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^115Wx2qa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Globally, the estimated proportion of the general population aged 60 and over with dementia is between 5% and 8%, equating to around 50 million people. Nearly 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the biggest causes of death worldwide. Factor Xa inhibitor direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become widely prescribed in recent years in the UK. These medications are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as achieving anticoagulation in the prevention of systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or deep vein thrombosis. Consequently, a significant proportion of the population with mild cognitive impairment or dementia are also treated with DOACs for these coexistent diagnoses.

In our local experience, which reflects changing practice throughout the developed world, many patients are transitioning from warfarin to factor Xa inhibitor DOACs, which do not require close monitoring of blood levels. Despite the absence of listed neuropsychiatric side effects in the British National Formulary (BNF) for these drugs, we suspected that two patients were experiencing iatrogenic worsening of their behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). We hypothesize that similar factor Xa inhibitor side effects are experienced by many older people to a varying degree and are wrongly attributed to BPSD.

### Niravam [^116rWXyY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 71%-93% of patients treated with alprazolam tapered completely off therapy compared to 89%-96% of placebo-treated patients. In a controlled post-marketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.

Seizures attributable to alprazolam were seen after drug discontinuance or dose reduction in 8 of 1980 patients with panic disorder or in patients participating in clinical trials where doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day for over 3 months were permitted. Five of these cases clearly occurred during abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation from daily doses of 2 to 10 mg. Three cases occurred in situations where there was not a clear relationship to abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation. In one instance, a seizure occurred after discontinuation from a single dose of 1 mg after tapering at a rate of 1 mg every 3 days from 6 mg daily. In two other instances, the relationship to taper is indeterminate; in both of these cases, the patients had been receiving doses of 3 mg daily prior to seizure. The duration of use in the above 8 cases ranged from 4 to 22 weeks. There have been occasional voluntary reports of patients developing seizures while apparently tapering gradually from alprazolam. The risk of seizure seems to be greatest 24–72 hours after discontinuation.

### How I manage anticoagulant therapy in older individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism [^116Z2S9u]. Blood (2019). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy is the most effective strategy to prevent arterial and venous thromboembolism. However, treating older individuals poses challenges due to increasing age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, which elevate the risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are underused and often underdosed in stroke prevention for older patients with atrial fibrillation, primarily due to concerns about bleeding risk. Poor adherence to anticoagulant therapy is another issue encountered by older patients with atrial fibrillation and those at risk of pulmonary embolism.

In this review, we present five clinical cases to illustrate common challenges with anticoagulant use in older patients, and discuss our approach to instituting safe and effective antithrombotic therapy.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1158bzAp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for, or are unwilling to receive vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5,599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable, to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day), to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.

- **Results**: Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P = 0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P = 0.57).

### Treatment with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban associated with significant worsening of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^116NiPFH]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A woman in her early 80s was admitted to her local District General Hospital following a fall. She was found to have a pulmonary embolus (PE) and to be in atrial fibrillation (AF). She was commenced on apixaban. During this admission, staff raised concerns about her memory and, upon discharge, referred her to the local memory assessment service (MAS).

Following an initial MAS assessment approximately three weeks later, the patient was commenced on the antidepressant mirtazapine for low mood and poor sleep. However, following a further three weeks, she was brought to the liaison department at the hospital following a physical assault on police officers and paramedics. Her husband confirmed a deterioration in his wife's memory over six months, with her becoming repetitive in conversation and forgetting who some of the neighbors were. She had also started accusing him of having an affair and stealing her money during this time. He denied these accusations, stating that they spent nearly all of their time together.

There had been a noticeable worsening in her condition following her hospital admission six weeks prior with a PE, with her becoming physically aggressive since then. She had assaulted her husband multiple times and frequently called the police. He explained that he had been forced to lock himself in the bathroom that day for his own safety. During the interview, the patient reported a low mood and poor sleep since the alleged affair, claiming she had seen the other person and found a slip in her husband's pocket. Her mood was labile, alternating between irritability and tearfulness.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Panic disorder is characterized by unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. It is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population, and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its etiology is not fully understood and is likely heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants — mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reactions compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We hand-searched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection criteria for inclusion encompassed all double-blind (blinding of participants and clinicians), randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing benzodiazepines with placebo. The trials targeted adult participants diagnosed with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

### Prescribing and deprescribing in very old age: Perceptions of very old adults, caregivers and health professionals [^111koZYe]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Although they are major consumers of medications, there is little evidence-based data to guide prescribing and deprescribing of medications for very old adults (80+ years).

- **Objectives**: To discover the perceptions of very old adults, caregivers, and health professionals in order to further examine the clinical and ethical issues raised by prescribing and deprescribing in very old age.

- **Methods**: Individual interviews were conducted with very old adults (n = 10) and caregivers (n = 6), while group interviews were conducted with health professionals (n = 11). The themes covered included perceptions of medication use, polypharmacy, deprescribing, and patient-health professional relationships. Thematic analysis was used to identify areas of convergence and divergence.

- **Results**: Very old adults are satisfied with the medications they are taking, do not see the need to reduce their medication use, and consider their doctor as the expert who should make the decisions regarding treatment. The perceptions of caregivers are similar to those of older adults, whereas health professionals believe that very old adults take a lot of inappropriate medications and list multiple barriers to deprescribing. All participants describe a normalization of medication use with aging.

- **Conclusion**: There is a dichotomy between the perception of the very old adults/caregivers and that of health professionals regarding the safety of medication in very old age. A cultural change regarding medication use seems essential to optimize therapy and support deprescribing in clinical practice.

### SPL drug information for alprazolam [^114M8Lac]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of alprazolam PO (also known as Xanax, Niravam):

- **Ataxia, oversedation**: Use caution in elderly patients, and patients with hepatic disease, alcoholic liver disease, or obesity.

- **Drug overdose**: Use caution in individuals with a history of alcoholism or substance abuse.

- **Exacerbation of depression**: Use caution in patients with depression.

- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: Use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as PO disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine.

- **Manic episode**: Use caution in patients with depression.

- **Neonatal abstinence syndrome**: Use caution in pregnant patients.

- **Respiratory depression**: Use extreme caution in patients with severe pulmonary disease. Obtain close monitoring in patients with impaired respiratory function. Discontinue alprazolam if signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, hypoventilation, or apnea occur.

- **Somnolence**: Use caution in patients taking other CNS depressants or using alcohol. Also, use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Use caution in patients with severe depression.

### Treatment with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban and rivaroxaban associated with significant worsening of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^116uXD48]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Further research could enable the compilation of a cerebral mitochondrial toxicity burden scale of drugs, similar to the existing anticholinergic burden on cognitive functioning. There are research techniques that can assess cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction using non-invasive brain scanning of lactate levels, which are considered to be a good correlate of mitochondrial function. Such a scale could inform clinical decision-making, allowing for the switching of patients to drugs that are potentially less toxic to cerebral mitochondria when appropriate.

We may then be able to significantly improve the quality of life and reduce the burden and cost for patients, their carers, psychiatric services, and the social care system by potentially avoiding psychiatric admission and placement in dementia care homes. In the UK, such placement fees range between £34,000 (residential) and £47,000 (nursing) per annum.

- **Patient's perspective**: Something changed when I was in hospital after my fall; something wasn't right. I feel calmer and much better now, ready to go back home with my husband.

- **Learning points**:
	- **Consider drug-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms** in older patients with suspected behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Avoid assuming that their worsening presentation is necessarily secondary to cerebral emboli due to a degree of vascular pathology on brain imaging and atrial fibrillation.
	- **Older patients are particularly prone** to experiencing neuropsychiatric side effects of drugs that may not have been apparent during preclinical trials. Polypharmacy and associated drug interactions should be closely monitored.

### Andexxa [^115VNdDv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the ANNEXA-4 study, among the 419 patients in the safety population treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban, there were 75 deaths (18%). There were 37 cardiovascular deaths related to bleeding, 19 cardiovascular deaths not related to bleeding, 14 non-cardiovascular deaths, and 5 deaths with an uncertain or unknown cause. The average time to death was 15 days after treatment, with all patients dying prior to Day 45. Of the 75 patients who died, the initial bleeding event was intracranial bleeding in 55 patients (73%), gastrointestinal bleeding in 14 patients (19%), and other bleeding types in 6 patients (8%).

- **Thromboembolic and ischemic events**: In Study 3 (ANNEXA-4), 45 out of 419 patients (10.7%) experienced one or more thromboembolic events: cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 19 patients (42%), deep venous thrombosis in 11 patients (24%), myocardial infarction in 9 patients (20%), pulmonary embolism in 5 patients (11%), and transient ischemic attack in 1 patient (2%). The median time to event was ten days. A total of 38% of patients with thromboembolic events (17 out of 45) experienced the event during the first three days. Of the 419 patients who received Andexxa, 282 (67.3%) received some form of re-anticoagulation within 30 days after treatment. Of these 282 patients, 16 received anticoagulation in response to a thrombotic event, while 266 received it as prophylaxis. Of these 266, 14 patients (5.3%) had a thrombotic event after resumption of anticoagulation, while of the 153 patients who did not receive anticoagulation as prophylaxis, 31 (20.3%) experienced a thrombotic event.

### Eliquis [^1142oqX1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dose**: The recommended dose of Eliquis for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. For patients with at least two of the following characteristics — age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL — the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.

- **Reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**: To reduce the risk, a recommended dose of 5 mg is taken orally twice daily.

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily, with the initial dose to be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. For hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days, while for knee replacement surgery, it is 12 days.

- **Treatment of DVT and PE**: The recommended dose of Eliquis is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the dose is adjusted to 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

- **Reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE**: After at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE, the recommended maintenance dose is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Missed dose**: If a dose of Eliquis is not taken at the scheduled time, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day, and the twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

- **Temporary interruption for surgery and other interventions**: Eliquis should be discontinued before surgical or other medical procedures.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^112ER3DX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical atrial fibrillation is short-lasting and asymptomatic, usually detectable only through long-term continuous monitoring with pacemakers or defibrillators. It is associated with an increased risk of stroke by a factor of 2.5. However, the benefit of treatment with oral anticoagulation remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a trial involving patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting from 6 minutes to 24 hours. Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy design to receive apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily when indicated) or aspirin at a dose of 81 mg daily. The trial medication was discontinued, and anticoagulation was started if subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting more than 24 hours or clinical atrial fibrillation developed. The primary efficacy outcome, stroke or systemic embolism, was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (all the patients who had undergone randomization). The primary safety outcome, major bleeding, was assessed in the on-treatment population (all the patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned trial drug, with follow-up censored 5 days after permanent discontinuation of trial medication for any reason).

- **Results**: We included 4012 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 76.8 ± 7.6 years and a mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.9 ± 1.1 (scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke); 36.1% of the patients were women. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 ± 1.8 years, the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism was evaluated in the study.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "Apixaban Dosage Calculator", is used for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator is a clinical tool designed to determine the appropriate dosage of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) utilized for thromboprophylaxis and the treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage is dependent on three primary factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). For patients with atrial fibrillation, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily if they possess at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, or body weight ≤ 60 kg.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban.

- **Inputs**:
	- Age is captured in years, ranging from 18 to 120.
	- Weight can be entered either in kilograms (30 to 300 kg) or pounds (66 to 660 lb). If entered in pounds, it is converted to kilograms using the conversion rate (1 kg = 2.20462 lb).
	- Creatinine clearance is measured in mL/min, ranging from 0 to 150.
	- The indication for use includes four options: atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE, or prophylaxis.

### Effectiveness and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban versus warfarin in frail patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111HcdLE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

While a standardized definition has yet to be agreed upon by experts, frailty has been described as a clinical syndrome associated with a patient's decreased ability to recover from a stressor event due to a decline in multiple physiological systems, ultimately resulting in poorer health outcomes. It has been posited that frailty is the product of aging, the interaction between multiple acute and chronic disease states, and patients' genetic predisposition.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is commonly associated with both advanced age — approximately 70% of NVAF patients are 65 to 85 years old and 10% are over 80 years — and multiple concomitant acute and chronic health conditions. For this reason, it is estimated that NVAF patients have as high as a four-fold increased odds of being classified as frail compared with non-NVAF patients. Despite being at an increased risk of thromboembolic events due to NVAF, frail patients appear less likely to receive adequate oral anticoagulation (OAC) compared with non-frail patients.

Some clinicians have advocated for the use of certain OACs, or doses of OAC, based on advanced age and/or the presence of various comorbid disease states, such as being over 75 years old, renal impairment, and prior history of bleeding, but not based on a comprehensive definition of frailty. There is a paucity of data evaluating the direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to warfarin in frail NVAF patients, particularly studies using a validated and comprehensive frailty definition. Therefore, we sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban.

### Escitalopram for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^111bwpMw]. JAMA (2009). High credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in older adults; however, few data exist to guide clinicians in efficacious and safe treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to be efficacious for younger adults with GAD, but benefits and risks may be different in older adults.

- **Objective**: To examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the SSRI escitalopram in older adults with GAD.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized controlled trial in primary care practices and related specialty clinics in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The study involved 177 participants aged 60 years or older with a principal diagnosis of GAD. Participants were randomized to receive either escitalopram or placebo. The trial was conducted between January 2005 and January 2008.

- **Interventions**: Twelve weeks of 10 to 20 mg/d of escitalopram (n = 85) or matching placebo (n = 92).

- **Main outcome measures**: Cumulative response was defined by the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of much or very much improved. Other measures included time to response, and changes in anxiety and role functioning, which were assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument activity limitations subscale, and the role-emotional impairment and social function subscales of the Medical Outcome Survey 36-item Short Form.

- **Results**: In the primary analytic strategy, where participants (n = 33) were censored at the time of dropout, the mean cumulative response rate for escitalopram was 69% (95% confidence interval, 58%-80%).

### Postoperative confusion increases in elderly long-term benzodiazepine users [^116DipDc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated the relationship between postoperative confusion and the duration of benzodiazepine exposure, preoperative anxiety, depressive state, and cognitive function in elderly patients regularly taking benzodiazepines. We studied 328 patients ranging in age from 65 to 80 years who underwent orthopedic surgery. Information on benzodiazepine use was obtained through face-to-face interviews and visual assessments of the patients' medicine chests. Postoperative confusion was assessed using a confusion-assessment method. The patients were divided into two groups: those who regularly took benzodiazepines and those who did not.

Fifty-seven (17%) of 328 patients were treated with benzodiazepines. There were no significant differences in preoperative Mini-Mental State (MMS) scores, anxiety scores, or depression scores between benzodiazepine users and nonusers. Postoperative confusion occurred in 15 (26%) of 57 benzodiazepine users and in 34 (13%) of 271 nonusers.

- **Duration of benzodiazepine use**: Among the benzodiazepine users, postoperative confusion was observed in 13 (31%) of 37 long-term users (daily use for more than 1 year) and in 2 (10%) of 20 short-term users (daily use for less than 1 year). The incidence of postoperative confusion was significantly more frequent in long-term benzodiazepine users than in short-term users or nonusers of benzodiazepines.

- **Cognitive assessment**: The patients who developed a score below 23 on the MMS were 5 (14%) of 37 long-term benzodiazepine users and 0 (0%) of 20 short-term benzodiazepine users.

In conclusion, the incidence of postoperative confusion was significantly higher in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use compared to short-term users and nonusers.
