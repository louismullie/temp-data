## Question

Sulfamethoxazole tmp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (TMP-SMX), covering mechanism, indications, dosing, special populations, adverse effects, drug interactions, resistance, and practical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and synergy. Then, I should verify labeled indications and dosing by indication. Next, I will review special populations, especially renal impairment and pediatrics. After that, I need to check adverse effects and monitoring. Then, I will examine drug interactions and resistance considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical pearls and a concise clinical summary, making sure each point is supported by appropriate references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanism of synergy, because dosing and PK/PD targets hinge on this. TMP-SMX combines sequential inhibition of folate synthesis: sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, and trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, producing mutual potentiation rather than simple additivity, which explains clinical efficacy across diverse pathogens including Pneumocystis jirovecii [^112psvoK] [^115KqQuu] [^117Dkdjw].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics before I anchor on dosing. Both agents are rapidly absorbed orally with peak levels at 1–4 hours, half-lives around 8–10 hours for trimethoprim and about 10 hours for sulfamethoxazole, and both are renally cleared with urine concentrations substantially higher than plasma; importantly, N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole accumulates in renal impairment and is not rapidly removed by CRRT, which has implications for toxicity and dose adjustment [^11442fvX] [^115vJ4qm] [^113uVBLs].

> I need to check labeled indications and standard dosing by condition to avoid overgeneralization. For uncomplicated UTI, typical adult dosing is 1 double-strength tablet every 12 hours for 10–14 days, with a 3-day regimen acceptable for uncomplicated cystitis in some contexts; for shigellosis, 5 days at the same dose is standard; for acute otitis media in children, weight-based dosing of 8 mg/kg trimethoprim and 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per day in two divided doses for 10 days is recommended; for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults, 14 days of DS twice daily is standard; for traveler's diarrhea, 5 days of DS twice daily is used; for Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment, 15–20 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component in divided doses for 14–21 days is recommended; for PCP prophylaxis, 1 DS tablet daily or three times weekly is standard in adults, with pediatric prophylaxis dosed by body surface area [^116pPv6W] [^115HAqZm] [^112psvoK] [^111qjbjT] [^1129NodS] [^112E5Q19].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations before concluding. In renal impairment, both components' half-lives are prolonged and dose reductions are required; for eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a reduction of about 16.7% is suggested, and for eGFR 10 mL/min/1.73 m², about 33.3% reduction is advised; in CRRT, sulfamethoxazole clearance is increased and doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose may be needed to maintain exposure, while trimethoprim exposure is relatively preserved, so early therapeutic drug monitoring is prudent; in pediatrics, TMP-SMX is contraindicated in infants under 2 months; in pregnancy, a recent randomized trial did not show improved birth outcomes with prophylactic TMP-SMX, so routine antenatal prophylaxis is not supported by outcome data [^113uVBLs] [^113ZPKwe] [^112H4jd8] [^113wZ69x].

> I should double-check adverse effects and monitoring because these drive safe use. Serious hematologic toxicity includes agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia; severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as SJS/TEN and DRESS occur, with higher rates in HIV; hyperkalemia is a predictable risk due to trimethoprim's amiloride-like effect, especially with ACE inhibitors/ARBs or renal dysfunction; hyponatremia, crystalluria, and CNS effects can occur; in G6PD deficiency, hemolysis is a concern; patients with AIDS have higher adverse event rates, particularly rash and cytopenias; baseline and periodic CBC, renal function, and electrolytes are advised, with heightened potassium monitoring in at-risk patients [^113RRnHU] [^11281EcK] [^112LLU1S] [^114pht5t] [^11795gCw].

> Let me consider drug interactions carefully, since TMP-SMX is both a perpetrator and victim of metabolic and transporter effects. Trimethoprim inhibits CYP2C8 and OCT2, and sulfamethoxazole inhibits CYP2C9, so coadministration with substrates like warfarin, sulfonylureas, or metformin can increase exposure and toxicity; TMP-SMX can also potentiate warfarin and cause bleeding; rare toxic delirium has been reported with amantadine; concomitant leucovorin should be avoided in PCP treatment due to antagonism and worse outcomes; I initially thought TMP-SMX was contraindicated with dofetilide, but wait, I should verify — some labels list dofetilide as a contraindication while others emphasize caution; given the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmias, I will treat this as a strong avoid combination in practice [^114aGWbr] [^117QEKR2] [^112SyHHX].

> Next, I should review resistance patterns and stewardship, because empiric use must be justified. Resistance to TMP-SMX is rising globally, particularly among uropathogens, yet in vitro and some clinical data suggest the combination slows resistance emergence compared with monotherapy; in HIV, systematic reviews suggest TMP-SMX prophylaxis may not increase — and might reduce — colonization or infection with resistant bacteria, though confounding is common and more rigorous studies are needed; regardless, use should be indication-specific and guided by local susceptibility data [^115nBctr] [^117Dkdjw] [^116bLCRt] [^113o2SD7].

> I will now examine practical pearls that change bedside decisions. For PCP, target exposures of trimethoprim above about 5 mg/L and sulfamethoxazole above about 100 mg/L correlate with efficacy, whereas concentrations above roughly 15 mg/L for trimethoprim and 200 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole, or N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole above 75 mg/L, increase toxicity; in CRRT, early TDM helps balance underexposure of sulfamethoxazole against accumulation of its metabolite; for low-risk sulfonamide allergy histories, direct oral challenge or standardized desensitization can succeed in most patients, though delayed rashes remain possible on retreatment; ensure adequate hydration to mitigate crystalluria; and remember that TMP-SMX is not reliable for eradicating group A streptococci, so avoid it for streptococcal pharyngitis [^114C6Hbr] [^116oZBTS] [^112BrZov] [^112SyHHX].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical positioning to ensure coherence. TMP-SMX remains a cornerstone for PCP treatment and prophylaxis, a reasonable option for selected UTIs, shigellosis, and traveler's diarrhea, and an alternative for some MRSA or Stenotrophomonas infections when susceptibility permits; its synergy supports efficacy, but rising resistance and notable toxicities — especially hyperkalemia and severe cutaneous reactions — require careful patient selection, dose adjustment in renal impairment, interaction screening, and, when appropriate, therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize outcomes [^1129NodS] [^111kKcmx] [^116XJbFe] [^111rRebh].

Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (TMP-SMX) is a fixed-dose combination antibiotic used for UTIs, PCP, MRSA, and other susceptible infections [^113oPfZ7] [^111NuE8i]. It is **contraindicated in infants under 2 months**, patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, and those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim [^112H4jd8] [^11795gCw]. Common adverse effects include rash, nausea, and hematologic abnormalities; serious risks include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperkalemia, and crystalluria [^113RRnHU] [^112LLU1S]. Dosing must be adjusted for renal impairment, and patients should maintain adequate hydration to prevent crystalluria [^116pPv6W] [^114aGWbr].

---

## Clinical indications

TMP-SMX is indicated for multiple infections, including:

- **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Uncomplicated and complicated UTIs caused by susceptible organisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris [^113oPfZ7].

- **Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)**: Treatment and prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS [^113oPfZ7] [^112E5Q19].

- **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**: Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA [^notfound].

- **Other infections**: Shigellosis, acute otitis media in pediatric patients, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and traveler's diarrhea [^113oPfZ7] [^111qjbjT].

---

## Mechanism of action

TMP-SMX combines two agents with **sequential inhibition of folate synthesis** [^111rRebh]. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, blocking dihydrofolic acid synthesis, while trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, preventing conversion of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. This dual blockade disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death [^117Dkdjw].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

Both components are rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations achieved within **1–4 hours** [^11442fvX]. Sulfamethoxazole is approximately 70% protein-bound, while **trimethoprim** is about 44% protein-bound [^114wLdLw]. Sulfamethoxazole is primarily metabolized by N4-acetylation, and trimethoprim undergoes oxidative metabolism [^11442fvX]. Both drugs are excreted primarily by the kidneys, necessitating dose adjustments in **renal impairment** [^115vJ4qm].

---

## Dosage and administration

Standard dosing regimens vary by indication:

| **Indication** | **Standard adult dosage** |
|-|-|
| UTIs | 1 double-strength (DS) tablet (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole) every 12 hours for 10–14 days [^112psvoK] |
| PCP treatment | 15–20 mg/kg/day trimethoprim component divided every 6–8 hours for 21 days [^112psvoK] |
| PCP prophylaxis | 1 DS tablet daily or three times weekly [^112E5Q19] |
| MRSA skin infections | 1–2 DS tablets every 12 hours for 7–14 days [^113Gsi3r] |
| Shigellosis | 1 DS tablet every 12 hours for 5 days [^112psvoK] |
| Traveler's diarrhea | 1 DS tablet every 12 hours for 5 days [^111qjbjT] |

---

Renal impairment requires dose adjustments: **reduce dose by 50% for creatinine clearance (CrCl) 15–30 mL/min** and by 50% or use an alternative agent for CrCl < 15 mL/min [^112E5Q19].

---

## Contraindications

TMP-SMX is contraindicated in the following situations:

- **Hypersensitivity**: Known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim [^112H4jd8].

- **Severe renal impairment**: Severe renal insufficiency when renal function cannot be monitored [^112H4jd8].

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Marked hepatic damage [^112H4jd8].

- **Infants**: Pediatric patients less than 2 months of age [^112H4jd8].

- **Megaloblastic anemia**: Documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency [^112H4jd8].

---

## Precautions and warnings

- **Hematologic toxicity**: Risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias [^113RRnHU].

- **Severe cutaneous reactions**: Risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [^113RRnHU].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs [^112LLU1S].

- **Crystalluria**: Risk of crystalluria and stone formation, especially with inadequate hydration [^114aGWbr].

- **Clostridioides difficile**: Risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea [^113RRnHU].

---

## Drug interactions

TMP-SMX has significant drug interactions, including:

- **Warfarin**: Potentiates anticoagulant effect, increasing bleeding risk.

- **Phenytoin**: Increased phenytoin levels, risk of toxicity.

- **Methotrexate**: Increased methotrexate levels, risk of toxicity.

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Increased risk of hyperkalemia [^117QEKR2].

- **Digoxin**: Increased digoxin levels, risk of toxicity.

---

## Adverse effects

Common adverse effects include:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite [^116ZgPCy].

- **Dermatologic**: Rash, urticaria, photosensitivity [^116ZgPCy].

- **Hematologic**: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia [^113RRnHU].

- **Hepatic**: Elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis [^113RRnHU].

- **Renal**: Crystalluria, renal impairment [^114aGWbr].

Serious adverse effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, severe hyperkalemia, and hepatic necrosis [^113RRnHU].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of renal function, liver function, and hematologic parameters is recommended during therapy [^114aGWbr].

- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration to prevent crystalluria and to report any signs of hypersensitivity or severe adverse reactions promptly [^114aGWbr].

- **Resistance**: Increasing resistance among certain pathogens, such as MRSA and Enterobacteriaceae, necessitates careful consideration of local resistance patterns and susceptibility testing [^113oPfZ7].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is rapidly
absorbed by following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound, and metabolized
forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. The metabolism of
sulfamethoxazole occurs predominantly by N4-acetylation, although the
glucuronide conjugate has been identified. The principal metabolites of
trimethoprim are the 1- and 3-oxides and the 3'- and 4'-hydroxy derivatives. The
free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the
therapeutically active forms. Approximately 44% of trimethoprim and 70% of
sulfamethoxazole are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent
sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an
insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of
sulfamethoxazole. Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4
hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with
severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both
components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION). Detectable amounts of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole
are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During
administration of 160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole b.i.d., the
mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 mcg/mL. The
steady-state minimal plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4
mcg/mL and 68.0 mcg/mL, respectively. These steady-state levels were achieved
after 3 days of drug administration.1

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^112BFkK7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been shown to reduce HIV-related mortality among adults and children when used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS have recommended TMP-SMX prophylaxis for immunosuppressed adults and children born to HIV-infected women.

The successful roll-out of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the importance of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in developed countries. However, in resource-limited settings where antiretroviral therapy coverage is still incomplete and where confirmation of HIV infection in children < 18 months of age is limited, TMP-SMX prophylaxis remains vital for improving HIV management outcomes.

Despite widespread recommendations and availability of convincing evidence of the effectiveness of TMP-SMX, the implementation of its use has been poor. The WHO estimated that, in 2006, only 1% of the 4 million children eligible for TMP-SMX received it. In Zimbabwe in 2007, only 10.5% of children eligible for TMP-SMX received it.

In Africa, barriers to implementation include shortages of trained staff, stock-outs of TMP-SMX, and failure of health care systems to identify individuals eligible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis. In addition, there is anxiety that it may not be cost-effective. However new evidence of the intervention's cost-effectiveness may alleviate these concerns.

Furthermore, there has been a concern that this intervention will not work in areas where resistance to TMP-SMX is thought to be high. Fortunately, there is now convincing evidence from South Africa and Zambia that it is effective even in these settings, and indeed the beneficial effects persist even as resistance to TMP-SMX increases.

Of great importance has been the fear that blanket TMP-SMX prophylaxis may lead to an increase in resistance to other drugs besides TMP-SMX among common microbial pathogens. There is evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis does not increase resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to pyrimethamime-sulfadoxine. However, it remains unclear whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. Biologically, when TMP-SMX causes multidrug resistance, this is thought to be a result of coselection and transference of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria. Conversely and indirectly, TMP-SMX prophylaxis may reduce development of multidrug resistance by preventing infections and, thereby, hospitalizations and exposure to other antibiotics.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116bLCRt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

After placing weight on good-quality studies and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns.

Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114thHFN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence with regard to whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis causes an increase in bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. From a public health perspective, an increase in resistance would reduce the usefulness of current first-line antibiotics and result in reduced options for treating common bacterial infections in developing countries. From an individual perspective, patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis may be at increased risk of treatment failure when they acquire a bacterial infection, although this has not been demonstrated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of TMP-SMX.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111kKcmx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003) and EMBASE (1980-February 2003). Key search terms included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and Staphylococcus aureus.

Data Synthesis

An evaluation of case reports, case series, and clinical studies focusing on the use of TMP/SMX for treatment of severe S. aureus infections was conducted. The majority of the reports indicate that TMP/SMX may be effective for the treatment of infections due to low bacterial burdens of susceptible strains of S. aureus.

Conclusions

In select infections, TMP/SMX may be a useful alternative to vancomycin for treatment of severe S. aureus infections. Additional randomized studies should be conducted comparing this agent with vancomycin and linezolid.

### Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115nBctr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfonamides have a glorious history. In 1935, they were the first class of true antimicrobial agents with life-saving potency. Today, 66 years later, increased bacterial resistance to sulfonamides and to trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antimicrobial agent that is 30 years younger than sulfonamides, has limited their use to only a few indications. In the treatment and prophylaxis of patients with urinary tract infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or TMP alone is still considered the first-line drug of choice, although increased bacterial resistance to these agents has been linked with treatment failure. TMP-SMZ has a possible role as a second- or third-line treatment for patients who have respiratory tract infections. In the developing world, where this inexpensive drug is widely used as first-line treatment, bacterial resistance has caused problems, especially with regard to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory tract infections. Use of TMP-SMZ as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection has rapidly increased the multidrug resistance of bacterial pathogens found in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Today, detailed and reliable knowledge on the resistance of bacterial pathogens to both TMP-SMZ and TMP is an essential requirement for the safe and effective use of these drugs in all clinical settings.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116gcvqq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has long been recommended for immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults and children born to HIV-infected women. Despite this, many resource-limited countries have not implemented this recommendation, partly because of fear of widespread antimicrobial resistance not only to TMP-SMX, but also to other antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-infected and/or exposed individuals increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in Medline, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ELDIS, and ID21.

Results

A total of 501 studies were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Only 8 studies were of high quality, of which only 2 had been specifically designed to answer this question. Studies were classified as (1) studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX and (2) studies comparing those who had a resistant infection with those who were not infected. Type 1 studies showed weak evidence that TMP-SMX protects against resistance. Type 2 studies provided more convincing evidence that TMP-SMX protects against infection.

Conclusion

There was some evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against resistance to other antibiotics. However, more carefully designed studies are needed to answer the question conclusively.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a
proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is
unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the
development of drug-resistant bacteria. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should

those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics,
patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome,
and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or
bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals,
hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy.
Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving
high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in
elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney
failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism but this is of
no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary
restriction.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound, and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. The metabolism of sulfamethoxazole occurs predominantly by N4-acetylation, although the glucuronide conjugate has been identified. The principal metabolites of trimethoprim are the 1- and 3-oxides and the 3'- and 4'-hydroxy derivatives. The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms. Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 µg/mL. The steady-state mean plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4 µg/mL and 68.0 µg/mL, respectively. These steady-state levels were achieved after three days of drug administration.1Excretion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considerably higher than are the concentrations in the blood. The average percentage of the dose recovered in urine from 0 to 72 hours after a single oral dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is 84.5% for total sulfonamide and 66.8% for free trimethoprim. Thirty percent of the total sulfonamide is excreted as free sulfamethoxazole, with the remaining as N4-acetylated metabolite.2When administered together as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, neither sulfamethoxazole nor trimethoprim affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other.

Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim distribute to sputum, vaginal fluid and middle ear fluid; trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretions, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in human milk.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults

For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Has the time come for routine trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis in patients taking biologic therapies? [^1173cbbk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with inflammatory diseases are treated with a variety of biologic agents. The association between use of biologics and tuberculosis is well known. Additionally, there are numerous case reports of infections in patients receiving biologics with organisms such as Pneumocystis, Listeria, Legionella, and Salmonella. Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System suggest that infection with these organisms in patients receiving infliximab is at least 5 times as frequent as would be expected if there was no association between use of the drug and the infection. Each of these organisms is typically susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), and this therefore represents a potentially attractive prophylaxis to prevent these infections in patients receiving biologics. A randomized controlled trial of TMP-SMZ prophylaxis in patients receiving biologics is necessary to prove that its utility outweighs risk, but may be best preceded by a multisite case-control study to determine which patients receiving biologics are at greatest risk.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. Sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations > 5 mg/L have been associated with clinical effectiveness for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, its metabolite N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity. All three components are cleared to some extent by renal clearance.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Which dosing regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be used to reach the target concentrations for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and which dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg lead to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

The dosing regimens suggested in this study can enhance the utilization of cotrimoxazole in hospitalized patients. The population pharmacokinetic models developed in this study can also be utilized to optimize treatment with cotrimoxazole for other infectious diseases.

Animal Data

In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.

Nonteratogenic Effects

See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.

Nursing Mothers: Levels of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in breast milk are approximately 2% to 5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding, jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use: Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Folate Deficiency

Avoid use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Hemolysis

In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.

Hypoglycemia

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism

The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

Porphyria and Hypothyroidism

Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim pharmacokinetics show large IIV in hospitalized patients, and are affected by eGFR and CRRT. The current recommended dose for PCP treatment leads to adequate exposure in general, but there is a risk of both under and over‐exposure. Dose reductions for patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 are suggested to reach similar exposure compared with patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases in patients with lower eGFR and high cotrimoxazole doses. Notably, in patients treated with CRRT, sulfamethoxazole clearance is increased. Therefore, doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed to reach similar exposure to patients without renal failure. Monitoring with TDM is necessary in patients treated with CRRT as high doses might lead to N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites: the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy- sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The formulation of N4-hydroxy metabolite is mediated via CYP2C9.

Trimethoprim is metabolized in vitro to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1- and 3-oxides and the 3- and 4-hydroxy derivatives.

The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms.

In vitro studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.

Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

Electrolyte Abnormalities

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of P. jiroveci pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults: For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis: For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia: For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jiroveci pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jiroveci pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults: For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

Objective

To report a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) associated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).

Case Summary

A 34-year-old Asian woman developed a severe, desquamating mucocutaneous reaction (TEN) after six days of taking TMP/SMX to treat a presumed urinary tract infection (UTI).

Discussion

TMP/SMX is often recommended as first-line therapy for UTIs, sinusitis, bronchitis, and as prophylaxis and treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. TEN is a rare, but severe condition associated with sulfonamide use. This article describes a typical case and offers an opportunity for review of this potentially serious reaction.

Conclusions

Sulfonamides are often implicated in the majority of drug-induced cases of TEN. This case report illustrates the typical presentation of sulfonamide-induced TEN with a prodrome, characteristic rash, mucous membrane lesions, and systemic involvement. Practitioners should be aware of this rare adverse effect and closely observe patients for cutaneous manifestations or complaints. Any suspected drug should be discontinued if clinical evaluation leads to the suspicion of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015 over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England and it remains a first line option for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death both in the general population and in high risk groups is unknown.

Lastly, reference lists of all papers that were deemed to be eligible during pilot searches were reviewed to identify any relevant publications that may have been cited.

The title and abstract (when available) of each publication were reviewed for relevance to the topic. When it was obvious from the title and/or abstract that a publication was not relevant, it was eliminated. When it was less clear, the full paper was read to determine whether it met all the inclusion criteria.

Eligible studies were reviewed for quality using quality assessment tools that were adapted from the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The tools were used to make a structured assessment of whether a study was protected from bias and confounding. Of interest in this aspect was the extent to which studies took account of these confounders: (1) stage of HIV disease, (2) previous hospitalization, and (3) previous antibiotic use. Assessments were made on whether each study had internal and external validity. A standardized form was used to extract data. One person (ELS) reviewed and extracted the data, and when there were uncertainties, advice was sought from one of the co-authors.

The findings from the studies were synthesized, with more credence being placed on studies that had fared better in the quality assessment process. In theory, it would have been possible to meta-analyze the results from studies reporting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and studies reporting pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. In practice, however, the studies that examined penicillin resistance reported differing outcomes; thus, it was not possible to combine them. It was possible to conduct separate meta-analyses for case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies of infection and/or colonization with MRSA.

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^111rRebh]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Some antimicrobial drug combinations show strongly synergistic effects, where the combined inhibitory activity is far greater than the sum of individual activities. However, in most cases, it is not clear why combinations may act synergistically. A mixture of trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), also known as Co-trimoxazole, is a widely used synergistic antimicrobial combination to treat a variety of bacterial infections. TMP-SMX is also effective against certain fungal infections and is the major treatment choice for pneumocystis pneumonia, which is one of the most common opportunistic infections in people with HIV-AIDS. In bacteria, SMX inhibits dihydropteroate (DHPte) production from the two folate precursors, p -aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPPP) (Fig. 1a). TMP inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Although no conclusive evidence has been provided, it is generally accepted that the potent synergy between these drugs derives simply from the sequential inhibition of adjacent steps in microbial THF biosynthesis. Mathematical modeling of this pathway suggests that this model is sufficient to explain how SMX action results in potentiation of TMP action, yet is inadequate to explain how TMP action potentiates SMX action.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^112BrZov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE

Sulfonamide antibiotics are commonly prescribed for the immunocompromised population as prophylaxis and directed therapy for opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii. Sulfonamide antibiotics are the second most frequently reported antibiotic allergy, with 3% to 8% of patients reporting a sulfonamide allergy. Sulfonamide antibiotics can cause immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions with various reaction severities. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also one of the most prevalent causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic syndrome. –

Although there is limited evidence on the cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics, it has been demonstrated that sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide nonantimicrobials are unlikely to cross-react due to differences in chemical structure, with the exception of sulfasalazine, a prodrug composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to the sulfa antibiotic sulfapyridine. Sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions target N1 (heterocyclic ring) or N4 (an aromatic amine), absent in sulfonamide nonantibiotics.

Risk stratification approach

Historically, patients with sulfonamide allergy histories consistent with a potentially immediate or benign delayed hypersensitivity were managed with desensitization or induction of tolerance procedures. Although skin testing with the nonirritant concentration was possible, it rarely yielded positive tests, and the test characteristics remain unknown. In patients with low-risk sulfonamide antibiotic allergies, a direct TMP/SMX challenge was tolerated in more than 94%. One- or 2-step TMP/SMX challenges have been described with up to 97% resulting in label removal in patients with low-risk allergy histories. However, it is unclear which patient populations may benefit from different allergy investigations or treatments. An analysis of older adults across 5 US sites recently found a lower 88% prevalence of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy delabeling after allergy testing. Interestingly, all 5 patients confirmed TMP/SMX allergic had immediate reactions observed in the office, with 1 individual receiving intramuscular epinephrine for progressive urticaria. Another consideration with sulfonamide antibiotic allergy delabeling is that most incident reactions are commonly delayed phenotypes. As such, drug challenge studies that have followed up delabeled patients with retreatment courses suggest that as many as 30% of patients may have delayed rashes with a full course. Therefore, all sulfonamide antibiotic allergy evaluations must include education and patient counseling regarding delayed reactions that can occur with the following treatment course.

Target concentrations for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are predominantly based on theoretical assumptions and in vitro measurements rather than an association with clinical outcomes. For the treatment of PCP, target concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been suggested and used in both research and TDM in clinical practice. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations above 5 mg/L are recommended. These targets are originally based on two small studies. The first study included 26 children with PCP and found that 3–5 mg/L for trimethoprim and 100–150 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole resulted in clinical effectiveness. The other study included eight adults with PCP and reported that trimethoprim concentrations below 5.5 mg/L were linked to treatment failure. The concentrations associated with toxicity have been studied more extensively: concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity both in healthy individuals as in patients with PCP. concentration‐dependent adverse events that have been described include hematological toxicity, hyperkalemia, renal failure and central nervous system adverse effects.,

Studies assessing the optimal initial dosing regimen to reach the target concentrations for PCP are lacking. Moreover, limited information is available regarding the need for dose reductions in patients with reduced renal function or on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Several dosing regimens have been proposed for patients with altered renal function, but these recommendations lack support from population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) simulations that consider both effectiveness and toxicity.,

To address these gaps, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole. Based on the measured serum concentrations, a model for trimethoprim and a combined population pharmacokinetic model for sulfamethoxazole and its metabolite N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole were developed. These models enabled us to simulate dose regimens and dose adjustments for patients with altered renal function or those receiving CRRT for PCP.

The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when co-administered with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted.

In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported.

In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor6,7.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

### Mutual potentiation drives synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole [^115KqQuu]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim (TMP)-sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widely used synergistic antimicrobial combination to treat a variety of bacterial and certain fungal infections. These drugs act by targeting sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway for tetrahydrofolate (THF), where SMX inhibits production of the THF precursor dihydropteroate, and TMP inhibits conversion of dihydrofolate (DHF) to THF. Consequently, SMX potentiates TMP by limiting de novo DHF production and this mono-potentiation mechanism is the current explanation for their synergistic action. Here, we demonstrate that this model is insufficient to explain the potent synergy of TMP-SMX. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we characterize a metabolic feedback loop in which THF is critical for production of the folate precursor dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPPP). We reveal that TMP potentiates SMX activity through inhibition of DHPPP synthesis. Our study demonstrates that the TMP-SMX synergy is driven by mutual potentiation of the action of each drug on the other.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115yeoVz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The clearance of sulfamethoxazole in patients on CRRT exceeds the median clearance of the patients in this study. For trimethoprim, the clearance in patients on CRRT was comparable to patients with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole is not rapidly eliminated by CRRT. The rapid clearance of sulfamethoxazole and the difference between sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole clearance has been previously reported in small case series. One possible explanation is that tubular reabsorption, which is significant for sulfamethoxazole, does not occur in patients treated with CRRT. When filtrated via CRRT, sulfamethoxazole will be cleared directly from the body via the ultrafiltrate. This lack of tubular reabsorption of sulfamethoxazole could explain the increased clearance observed in patients treated with CRRT. In contrast, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, being reabsorbed to a lesser extent, is less affected by CRRT. This change in pharmacokinetics presents a risk of rapid clearance of active sulfamethoxazole in CRRT patients, while N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates, potentially leading to underexposure or toxicity. The clinical impact is unclear as the exposure to trimethoprim is sufficient in these patients. To prevent toxicity, therapy for PCP could be started with TID 1,920 mg and doses can be subsequently individualized using early TDM. For other infections requiring lower daily doses and thereby a lower risk of N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation, doubling the cotrimoxazole dose should be considered to reach similar exposure of sulfamethoxazole compared with patients with a normal renal function.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ds [^117Dkdjw]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Microbiology: Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial
synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para -aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the
production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and
reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme,

dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, this combination blocks two consecutive steps
in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many
bacteria.

In vitro studies have shown that bacterial
resistance develops more slowly with this combination than with either
sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

In vitro serial dilution tests have shown that the
spectrum of antibacterial activity of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim includes
the common urinary tract pathogens with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The following organisms are usually
susceptible: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus species including Proteus
vulgaris. The usual spectrum of antimicrobial activity of
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim includes the following bacterial pathogens
isolated from middle ear exudate and from bronchial secretions: Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant
strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are usually susceptible. The usual spectrum also includes enterotoxigenic
strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) causing bacterial
gastroenteritis.

The recommended quantitative disc susceptibility
method may be used for estimating the susceptibility of bacteria to
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

With this
procedure, a report from the laboratory of "Susceptible to trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole" indicates that the infection is likely to respond to therapy
with this product. If the infection is confined to the urine, a report of
"Intermediate susceptibility to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole" also
indicates that the infection is likely to respond. A report of "Resistant to
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole" indicates that the infection is unlikely to
respond to therapy with this product.

PRECAUTIONS

Development of drug resistant bacteria

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Folate deficiency

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Hemolysis

In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Hypoglycemia

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

Phenylalanine metabolism

Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

Dose reductions to reach equivalent exposure

In Table 4, the doses required to reach equivalent exposure compared with a patient with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 (the median eGFR in the study population) are shown and the lowest dose that leads to > 25% of the simulated patients reaching concentrations above the upper limit of the target range. In Figures S6 and S7 the exposure reached with different dosing regimens is visualized. The dose reductions were similar for all simulated eGFRs for both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for patients with a low eGFR. To reach equivalent exposure a dose reduction of 16.7% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and of 33.3% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. For CRRT the dose adjustments were not similar for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. A 100% increased dose is needed for sulfamethoxazole, while for trimethoprim no dose adjustments are required. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases with increasing dose for patients with reduced renal function.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^115uN3T1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) hypersensitivity — epidemiology, diagnosis, and management are detailed as follows: In HIV populations, sensitivity to SMZ-TMP has been reported to range from 34% to 50%. Validated diagnostic testing is not currently available; if an IgE-mediated adverse drug reaction is suspected, skin testing using a nonirritating concentration of 1:100 dilution of 80 mg/mL, or 8.0 mg/mL, may be considered, and oral challenge either as a single full dose or as 1/10th of the dose followed by the full dose may be considered on the basis of history and skin test results. Dapsone may be tolerated, but avoidance of dapsone is recommended in patients with histories of severe reactions to sulfonamides. Desensitization is an important component of management, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters has recommended that the term "temporary induction of tolerance" is more appropriate than desensitization; in severe DHRs (SJS, TEN, DRESS) the drug should be avoided, though if no alternatives exist a previously reported protocol successfully used for 7 patients may be considered. In HIV patients, temporary induction of tolerance protocols have shown similar success rates (initial success: 80%–90%; long-term: 60%–80%); some studies found full-dose challenge success rates of 58% to 72% versus 60% to 80% for temporary induction, and Leoung et al reported a 75% success rate with temporary induction compared with 58% with full-dose challenge (P = 0.014). For non-HIV settings, case series indicate temporary induction of tolerance may be considered, including 4 patients managed with 8-day or 22-day protocols and a series in which 90% of 72 patients had successful outcomes with 6-step, 14-step, or more than 1-day protocols. In summary, temporary induction of tolerance can be used safely and effectively in patients with and without HIV who have SMZ-TMP hypersensitivity; for HIV-positive patients with mild hypersensitivity, a full-dose challenge can be considered, though this option may result in higher rates of ADRs, and a standardized protocol is not currently available.

For patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2, b.i.d. 1,920 mg results in 92.2% of the simulated patients on‐target, 6.9% low, and 0.9% high concentrations for trimethoprim and 58.3% on‐target, 14.9% low, and 26.8% high sulfamethoxazole concentrations. b.i.d. 1,440 mg leads to 72.9% within, 27.1% low exposure and no concentrations above the therapeutic range for trimethoprim and 48.4% within 43.4% below and 8.2% above the target range for sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole.

Similarly, for patients with an eGFR of 50 mL/minute/1.73 m 2, b.i.d. 1,920 mg leads to 84.9% on‐target, 14.6% low, and 0.5% high trimethoprim concentrations, and 65.1% of the patients on‐target, 23.3% low, and 11.6% high concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole.

In patients on CRRT trimethoprim, TID 1,920 mg resulted in 94.0% within, 4.3% below, and 1.7% above the target range for trimethoprim. Sulfamethoxazole concentrations were below the target range for more than 50% of the simulated patients using all dosing regimens lower than TID 1,920 mg; furthermore, accumulation of N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole occurred in patients receiving TID 1,920 mg leading to toxic concentrations in 38.2% of the patients (Figure 1). Hence, none of the current dosing regimens achieved adequate target attainment for most simulated patients for sulfamethoxazole.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is therefore used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from infections caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 h. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately, 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration‐dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high‐dose cotrimoxazole.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^113o2SD7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of studies relating to colonization and/or infection with MRSA shows the potential effect of differing study designs on resistance outcomes. The 2 cohort studies (ie, the most robust studies) clearly showed reduced MRSA colonization and/or infection, both individually and when combined, whereas the cross-sectional and case-control studies showed no effect.

This literature review had several limitations. Because TMP-SMX prophylaxis has long been proven to save lives of HIV-infected patients, only observational studies, which have more potential for bias and confounding, were available for review. Most studies did not control for factors that are known to independently increase antibiotic resistance. For example, only 3 studies adjusted for HIV disease progression or previous hospitalization. Previous hospitalization has been reported as an important risk factor for colonization or infection with MRSA.

Most studies did not provide data on the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Of the studies that did, the duration of exposure is shorter than expected in clinical practice in resource-limited settings. Because of the shortage of antiretroviral therapy in such settings, HIV-infected adults are likely to be receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for much longer periods than was evaluated in these studies. However, the finding from Gill et al may be more generalizable to HIV-exposed infants, because TMP-SMX was given according to guidelines used in many resource-limited settings.

Most studies only evaluated resistance to 1 antibiotic. This makes it difficult to know whether findings can be applied across different antibiotic classes.

The other limitation of the review was the heterogeneity of study designs, class of bacteria, and drug classes investigated, which makes comparing study findings problematic and makes it inappropriate to conduct a meta-analysis for all studies.

Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jiroveci pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis5. However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

### A trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in pregnancy to improve birth outcomes [^113wZ69x]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Maternal infections underlie several adverse birth outcomes. Whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during pregnancy will improve birth outcomes is unknown.

Methods

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Zimbabwe, we assigned pregnant women to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, at a dose of 960 mg daily, or placebo from at least 14 weeks' gestation until delivery. The primary outcome was birth weight.

Results

Among 993 participants (131 with human immunodeficiency virus infection), 498 were randomly assigned to receive placebo and 495 to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with the first dose received at a median of 21.7 weeks' gestation (interquartile range, 17.3 to 26.4). In intention-to-treat analyses, the mean (± SD) birth weight was 3040 ± 460 g in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 3019 ± 526 g in the placebo group (mean difference, 20 g, 95% confidence interval, -43 to 83; P = 0.53). The number of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

In Zimbabwe, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during pregnancy did not significantly increase infant birth weight. (Funded by Wellcome and others; Pan African Clinical Trials Registry number, PACTR202107707978619.).
