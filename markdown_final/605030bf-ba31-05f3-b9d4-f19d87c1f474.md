## Question

Management for reprofusion injury of the liver after rapid fluid resuscitation ￼

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing hepatic reperfusion injury after rapid fluid resuscitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury and how rapid resuscitation modifies it. Then, I should verify the clinical context and risk stratification. Next, I will review fluid strategy, vasopressor choices, and hemodynamic targets. After that, I need to check for adjunctive therapies and monitoring tools. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight what to avoid, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury is a two-hit process with ischemic mitochondrial dysfunction followed by reperfusion-driven reactive oxygen species, endothelial injury, and innate immune activation, which can be amplified by rapid, large-volume resuscitation through hemodilution, coagulopathy, and inflammatory signaling, worsening hepatocellular injury and microcirculatory failure [^168ab5a7] [^182b3f9e] [^add8059d].

> Hold on, let's not conflate contexts; I need to check the clinical scenarios where this matters most: hemorrhagic shock with liver trauma, liver transplantation with post-reperfusion syndrome, and ischemic hepatitis in acute liver failure or acute-on-chronic liver failure, because management nuances differ and the strength of evidence varies by scenario [^268ac48e] [^2296699c] [^0212c9ff].

> Next, I should review fluid strategy with a focus on avoiding harm; I initially thought "balanced crystalloids only", but wait, let me verify the colloid question in liver failure: guidelines advise against hydroxyethyl starch and gelatin for initial resuscitation in ALF/ACLF due to coagulopathy and lack of benefit, and they suggest albumin when serum albumin is low, which is particularly relevant in cirrhosis and ACLF where effective oncotic pressure and splanchnic dynamics matter [^d946a566] [^3e911fc9] [^862fd527]. I should double-check that balanced crystalloids like lactated Ringer's or acetated Ringer's are preferred over saline to mitigate hyperchloremic acidosis and chloride load, and that restrictive, goal-directed resuscitation is favored over liberal flooding once initial stabilization is done [^3a7f3ae9] [^c2cb404b].

> I will now examine vasopressor choices and hemodynamic targets; let me verify first-line therapy and MAP goals: norepinephrine is recommended as first-line for persistent hypotension after fluids in ALF/ACLF, with a typical MAP target of 65 mmHg, while adding low-dose vasopressin if MAP remains inadequate. Importantly, permissive hypotension is not appropriate in ALF/ACLF where cerebral perfusion and hepatocellular oxygen delivery are priorities, so I should avoid MAP targets below 60 mmHg in this population [^d946a566] [^8c6825bb] [^84460e13]. But wait, what if the patient is a trauma patient with uncontrolled hemorrhage? In that case, hypotensive resuscitation is appropriate until hemorrhage control, after which a MAP near 65–80 mmHg is reasonable to balance perfusion and edema risk, so I need to align the MAP target with the clinical phase and etiology [^d9bec6a3] [^af96edae].

> Let me consider adjunctive strategies that might mitigate reperfusion injury; I should confirm what has credible support: in liver transplantation, a combined pharmacologic approach (methylprednisolone, epoprostenol, and inhaled nitric oxide) reduced ischemia–reperfusion injury markers and improved early graft function, suggesting a multimodal anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory strategy can be beneficial in selected contexts, though this is not generalizable to trauma or ALF outside the OR [^2296699c]. Regulated hepatic reperfusion with controlled pressure, temperature, and substrate-enriched perfusate improved survival and reduced hepatocellular injury in a large-animal warm ischemia model, but this remains investigational and not standard of care in humans yet [^693503e1]. Antioxidants and pharmacologic preconditioning have shown signals in small studies but lack robust clinical evidence for routine use, so I should avoid overpromising these therapies [^d1ffa6d7] [^39a66e31].

> Next, I should review monitoring to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload; I need to ensure dynamic measures guide fluids: stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, passive leg raise with cardiac output, or mini-fluid challenges can help determine fluid responsiveness, especially in mechanically ventilated patients, while lactate, base excess, and capillary refill track perfusion. In cirrhosis and ACLF, invasive arterial lines and echocardiography are reasonable to guide therapy and detect myocardial dysfunction or volume maldistribution [^d7600089] [^84460e13]. Hold on, I should verify that static measures like CVP are unreliable in this population; yes, guidelines emphasize dynamic over static indices for fluid responsiveness in shock states [^d7600089].

> I should confirm what to avoid so we don't inadvertently worsen reperfusion injury: avoid HES and gelatin for initial resuscitation in ALF/ACLF, avoid routine correction of coagulopathy unless bleeding or procedural needs dictate, and avoid excessive crystalloid loads that drive edema and compartment syndromes. In trauma with uncontrolled hemorrhage, avoid early aggressive crystalloid before source control, and in ALF, avoid hypotension that compromises cerebral and hepatic perfusion [^d946a566] [^1d93c7b5] [^c2cb404b] [^d9bec6a3].

> Let me synthesize a practical, phase-based algorithm and sanity-check each step: in the initial stabilization phase, use balanced crystalloids in small-to-moderate boluses with dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness, and escalate to norepinephrine to achieve MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in ALF/ACLF or 65–80 mmHg in controlled hemorrhage after source control. In the definitive management phase, tailor fluids to perfusion targets, consider albumin when albumin is low in cirrhosis/ACLF, and employ adjuncts like steroids and prostacyclin selectively in transplantation. In the recovery phase, de-escalate vasopressors as perfusion improves and monitor for delayed complications such as ischemic cholangiopathy or AKI, adjusting fluids to a net neutral or negative balance as tolerated [^d946a566] [^2296699c] [^c2cb404b].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence is transparent: most of the hemodynamic and fluid recommendations in ALF/ACLF are based on moderate-quality guideline consensus with extrapolation from general critical care, whereas the multimodal pharmacologic approach and regulated reperfusion data are promising but limited to specific settings or preclinical models. Therefore, I should emphasize individualized, monitored care and acknowledge uncertainty where it exists [^d946a566] [^2296699c] [^693503e1].

Reperfusion injury after rapid fluid resuscitation in liver trauma is best managed by **restrictive, balanced crystalloids** [^3a7f3ae9] with **early vasopressors** [^8c6825bb] to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^384ab1bf], while avoiding HES [^3e911fc9] and gelatin [^862fd527]. Key steps include: control bleeding [^268ac48e], limit fluids to ~1–2 L before source control, use LR or acetated Ringer's [^10e04d99], and add norepinephrine [^8c6825bb] if MAP is < 65 mmHg. Monitor lactate, base deficit, and dynamic indices (PPV/ SVV) [^d7600089] to guide therapy and avoid overload [^c2cb404b]. Early albumin is reasonable in cirrhosis or low albumin [^d946a566], and adjuncts like mannitol [^fe05cfe0] or NAC may be considered in select cases. This approach reduces edema, coagulopathy, and organ failure while preserving perfusion [^31f2660a].

## Pathophysiology of reperfusion injury in liver trauma

Reperfusion injury after rapid fluid resuscitation in liver trauma is driven by:

- **Oxidative stress**: ROS overwhelm endogenous antioxidants, causing hepatocyte injury [^182b3f9e].
- **Inflammatory cascade**: cytokines and neutrophil activation amplify tissue damage [^168ab5a7].
- **Endothelial dysfunction**: microvascular compromise worsens ischemia and edema [^2296699c].
- **Coagulopathy**: dilution and consumption of clotting factors increase bleeding risk [^3e911fc9].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Patients may present with:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: persistent hypotension despite fluids [^8c6825bb].
- **Metabolic acidosis**: elevated lactate and base deficit [^af96edae].
- **Coagulopathy**: prolonged PT/INR and thrombocytopenia [^notfound].
- **Hepatic dysfunction**: rising AST/ALT and bilirubin [^notfound].
- **Multi-organ failure**: AKI, ARDS, and neurologic decline [^2296699c].

---

## Evidence-based management strategies

### Fluid resuscitation

- **Restrictive approach**: Limit fluids to ~1–2 L before source control to limit edema and coagulopathy [^notfound].
- **Balanced crystalloids**: Use LR or acetated Ringer's; avoid saline to reduce hyperchloremic acidosis [^notfound].
- **Avoid HES and gelatin**: Associated with coagulopathy and AKI in liver failure [^3e911fc9] [^862fd527].
- **Albumin**: Consider early in cirrhosis or low albumin to improve oncotic pressure and perfusion [^d946a566].

---

### Vasopressor support

Use **norepinephrine as first-line** [^8c6825bb] to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^384ab1bf]; add vasopressin if MAP remains inadequate [^d946a566]. Early vasopressors reduce fluid requirements and edema while preserving perfusion [^b1e2055a].

---

### Hemostatic strategies

- **Damage control resuscitation**: Early balanced blood products (PRBC:FFP:platelets 1:1:1) to limit crystalloid and coagulopathy [^notfound].
- **Surgical control**: Packing, Pringle maneuver, or angioembolization for ongoing hemorrhage [^5c5d9164].
- **Tranexamic acid**: Consider in trauma with suspected fibrinolysis [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and endpoints

- **Hemodynamics**: Arterial line for continuous BP; target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^384ab1bf].
- **Perfusion**: Lactate, base deficit, and dynamic indices (PPV/SVV) to guide fluids [^d7600089].
- **Coagulation**: Serial PT/INR, platelets, and fibrinogen to guide transfusion [^notfound].
- **Liver function**: AST/ALT, bilirubin, and ammonia to track hepatic recovery [^notfound].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjuncts to consider include **mannitol** for osmotic diuresis and potential ROS modulation in select cases [^notfound], and **N-acetylcysteine** for antioxidant support, though evidence is limited [^notfound]. Glucocorticoids may be used selectively in transplant or severe inflammatory states, but routine use is not supported [^notfound].

### Reperfusion injury after hemorrhage: a collective review [^add8059d]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current knowledge of hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion injury.

Summary Background Data

Patients with hemorrhagic shock require optimal resuscitation and cessation of ongoing bleeding. Often our resuscitative measures, while necessary, cause a wide range of detrimental physiologic effects. Research continues to answer questions regarding measurable endpoints and optimal fluids used in resuscitation. Elucidation and understanding of the complex metabolic pathways involved in reperfusion injury are areas of intense current investigative effort.

Methods

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE and key words related to experimental and clinical studies concerning shock and reperfusion.

Results

Experimental studies have shown that resuscitation with colloid and crystalloid show no difference in outcomes in critically ill patients. Laboratory studies are showing promising results with immunomodulation of response to injury. However, no clinical trials have shown significance yet.

Conclusions

It is unlikely that a single treatment modality or "magic bullet" will be able to substantially block such a complex regulated process unless performed before feedback mechanisms known to be in place. Ongoing translational research will inevitably have a major impact on patient care.

### Validity of mini-fluid challenge for predicting fluid responsiveness following liver transplantation [^64b06f63]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemodynamic derangements are frequently observed during and after liver transplantation, mainly due to major blood loss, decreased venous return, and (or) reperfusion injury-induced vasodilatation. Fluid therapy is the cornerstone of hemodynamic management for unstable patients. The main goals of fluid therapy are to increase cardiac output (CO) and improve tissue perfusion.

The concept of fluid responsiveness has been suggested as a guide for fluid administration in critically ill patients to avoid over- and under-fluid resuscitation. Fluid responsiveness is defined as the ability of the left ventricle to increase stroke volume (SV) after fluid administration. Several methods have been suggested to detect fluid responsiveness. Of these methods, some that depend on heart−lung interactions have been shown to be effective during intraoperative management of liver transplantation patients. However, during the postoperative period, these methods are not feasible in patients with spontaneous breathing activity. In these cases, mini-fluid challenge has emerged as an alternative for preload challenge.

Several studies have investigated the value of mini-fluid challenge as a predictor of subsequent fluid infusion under different clinical conditions. However, none of these studies included patients with end-stage liver disease ESLD. Patients with ESLD have abnormal blood volume distribution, with a substantial fraction of this volume in the splanchnic circulation. Rapid volume loading in these patients has little impact on CO because a large proportion of infused fluid is shifted to the splanchnic system. As a result, aggressive volume expansion to maintain tissue perfusion in liver transplantation recipients may be associated with volume overload and increased risks of poor graft function and postoperative morbidity. Moreover, not all patients with ESLD exhibit the same response to changes in blood volume. Healthy individuals and patients with Child A cirrhosis differ in their response to blood volume expansion compared to patients with Child B and C cirrhosis.

The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the validity of mini-fluid challenge as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with ESLD after liver transplantation. The seconadry objective was to examine the consistency of this validity among different Child classification. Our hypothesis was that mini-fluid challenge would not be a valid tool to predict fluid responsiveness in cirrhotic patients after liver transplant.

### Molecular biology of liver ischemia / reperfusion injury: established mechanisms and recent advancements [^182b3f9e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs in a variety of clinical contexts, including transplantation, liver resection surgery, trauma, and hypovolemic shock. The mechanism of organ damage after I/R has been studied extensively and consists of complex interactions of multiple inflammatory pathways. The major contributors to I/R injury include production of reactive oxygen species, release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and activation of immune cells to promote inflammation and tissue damage. Recent research has focused on the mechanisms by which these immune responses are initially activated through signaling molecules and their cellular receptors. Thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of liver I/R may yield novel therapeutic strategies to reduce I/R injury and lead to improved clinical outcomes.

### The contemporary role of antioxidant therapy in attenuating liver ischemia-reperfusion injury: a review [^d1ffa6d7]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress is an important factor in many pathological conditions such as inflammation, cancer, ageing and organ response to ischemia-reperfusion. Humans have developed a complex antioxidant system to eliminate or attenuate oxidative stress. Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in a number of clinical settings, including liver surgery, transplantation, and hemorrhagic shock with subsequent fluid resuscitation, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by significant oxidative stress but accompanied with depletion of endogenous antioxidants. This review has 2 aims: firstly, to highlight the clinical significance of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury, the underlying mechanisms and the main pathways by which the antioxidants function, and secondly, to describe the new developments that are ongoing in antioxidant therapy and to present the experimental and clinical evidence about the role of antioxidants in modulating hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.

### Major hepatic trauma: warm ischemic tolerance of the liver after hemorrhagic shock [^5affb065]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The management of severe hepatic trauma frequently involves exposing the liver to varying periods of warm ischemia. The ischemic tolerance of the liver, in the setting of hemorrhagic shock (HS) and trauma, is presently unknown. We tested the hypothesis that warm ischemic tolerance of the porcine liver will be decreased following resuscitation from HS.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-three Yorkshire pigs were divided into three groups: 1) hepatic ischemia alone (HI, n = 9); 2) hemorrhagic shock alone (HS, n = 3); and 3) hemorrhagic shock plus hepatic ischemia combined (HSHI, n = 11). Following reperfusion, a liver biopsy was obtained and serial blood chemistries were sampled.

Results

Post-operative day 7 mortality was increased in the HSHI group (7/11) compared to the HI (0/9) group, P = 0.038. Notably, deaths did not result from acute liver failure, but rather from intra-operative hemodynamic collapse shortly following hepatic reperfusion. In addition, the HSHI group experienced significantly elevated lactic acid, serum creatinine and liver enzyme levels. Analysis of the liver biopsy samples is consistent with a more severe liver injury in the HSHI group.

Conclusions

The warm ischemic tolerance of the liver following resuscitation from HS is significantly decreased in this porcine model compared to HS or HI alone. Mortality was associated with acute intra-operative hemodynamic collapse occurring shortly after hepatic reperfusion.

### Subphenotypes and the De ritis ratio for mortality risk stratification in sepsis-associated acute liver injury: a retrospective cohort study [^326ead53]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

When examining the sepsis subgroups, a difference between surgical sepsis and patients admitted for medical reasons becomes apparent. Surgical sepsis often results from localized infections, such as intra-abdominal or post-operative complications, where the primary driver of organ dysfunction may be an ischemia-reperfusion injury rather than a systemic inflammatory response alone. In contrast, medical sepsis frequently originates from systemic infections like pneumonia or urosepsis, which are more likely to trigger widespread inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, including hepatic involvement. These differing mechanisms might explain why intermediate De Ritis ratios (i.e. 1–2) are associated with a more pronounced risk increase in medical patients. Patients with a medical admission and a De Ritis ratio of ≥ 2 have a markedly higher mortality risk, indicating more than double the risk compared to those with a ratio of ≤ 1, who do not exhibit increased risk, supported by previous findings. Additionally, surgical patients typically undergo extensive perioperative management (e.g. fluid resuscitation), which may mitigate liver dysfunction and its prognostic impact. The relative resilience of surgical patients to moderate liver enzyme alterations could contribute to the observed weaker association. While the De Ritis ratio remains a valuable prognostic marker across both groups, these findings highlight the necessity of contextualizing its interpretation based on sepsis aetiology. Future studies should further explore these differences, potentially incorporating additional markers of hepatic and systemic injury to refine risk stratification in distinct sepsis subgroups.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^c01c1b60]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Taken together, there is no reliable evidence that administration of fluids, beyond the correction of hypovolaemia, results in a sustained increase in renal blood flow or renal oxygen delivery. On the contrary, solid clinical evidence shows that a positive fluid balance has negative consequences on clinical outcomes.

Dogma #2: Treatment of crush syndrome with aggressive fluid resuscitation

Crush syndrome may result from trauma associated with massive muscular compression, rhabdomyolysis, and reperfusion injury. In the presence of rhabdomyolysis, the necrotizing muscle fibres release myoglobin, creatine phosphokinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and intracellular electrolytes. When compression is released, reperfusion releases these substances into the systemic circulation, thereby causing electrolyte and metabolic imbalance, such as hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis. The most severe complications of crush syndrome include AKI, arrhythmia and liver injury. Though in this context the pathophysiology of AKI is not completely understood, it appears rational that the proteins released during rhabdomyolysis cause glomerular and tubular obstruction.

Currently, it is believed that aggressive fluid therapy, often combined with diuretics (forced diuresis) or hyperosmotic solutions like mannitol, dilutes unappreciated molecules and flushes them out of the kidneys. "Aggressive" denotes the intravenous administration of a combination of fluids, e.g. 1 part each of NaCl 0.9% and glucose 5%, and 100 mmol hydrogencarbonat per 2 l of volume. In large-scale emergencies, where close medical supervision of the individual patients is not possible, at least 3–6 l per day are recommended, while 10 l or more per day are common practice if continuous supervision from the moment of trauma rescue until discharge from the ICU is possible. However, it is noteworthy that the evidence to support this approach is sparse and derived solely from animal trials and case reports.

### The validity of central venous to arterial carbon dioxide difference to predict adequate fluid management during living donor liver transplantation. A prospective observational study [^f61f2342]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

End-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation can be prone to severe hemodynamic and metabolic changes. In the dissection phase; bleeding and hypovolemia are frequent, while in the an-hepatic period venous return may decrease resulting in a reduction in left ventricular preload while after de-clamping and starting the neo-hepatic phase, the reperfusion injury and metabolic derangement can be severe enough to cause serious consequences.

Adequate tissue perfusion is an essential component of oxygenation during high-risk surgery and may improve the outcome. Proper monitoring of fluid resuscitation has been shown to reduce organ failure and hospital stay. The early warning signals of tissue hypoxia, such as lactate, central venous to arterial CO 2 gradient and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂, 8], are essential indicators of the changes in the O₂ delivery/consumption (DO₂/VO₂) relationship during high-risk surgery.

The difference between PCO 2 in mixed venous blood (PvCO₂) and PCO 2 in arterial blood (PaCO₂) is defined as the mixed venous-to-arterial CO₂ tension gap [Pulm (P-a) CO₂] and is affected by cardiac output and global CO 2 production, as well as the complex relationship between PCO 2 and CO 2 content. Normally, Pulm(P-a) CO₂ does not exceed 6 mmHg. Elevated [Pulm(P-a) CO₂] gradient has been observed in all types of circulatory failure (cardiogenic, obstructive, hypovolemic and distributive shock).

Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) is derived from the analysis of the arterial pulse waveform and is currently integrated in many monitors and is used as a valid tool to predict fluid responsiveness and to guide fluid management during liver transplantation.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous study assessed the ability of the Central CO 2 gap or Pulmonary CO 2 gap to predict fluid responsiveness and to guide optimization of fluid status during liver transplantation.

Our study aimed to assess the ability of the Central and Pulmonary CO 2 gaps to guide adequate fluid management during liver transplantation. We hypothesize that CO 2 gaps can be a complementary tool to PPV to guide adequate fluid management.

### Liver injury: what you need to know [^db83a4d3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The liver is the most commonly injured abdominal solid organ regardless of mechanism. The majority of liver injuries are grades I to III, with 12% to 20% as grades IV and V. In the hemodynamically stable patient or prompt responder to resuscitation, 85% to 90% of blunt liver injuries can be managed nonoperatively, regardless of the grade of injury. The promulgation of nonoperative management has resulted in decreased overall mortality for blunt liver injury. On the other hand, over the past 30 years, major advances in resuscitation science, intensive care, damage-control surgery, and nonoperative adjuncts have done little to reduce the operative morbidity and mortality of grades IV and V liver injuries. Angiography with embolization is often effective in stopping bleeding. However, angioembolization confers additional risk of complications (i.e., major hepatic necrosis and sepsis). This review will briefly present critical surgical anatomy and grading systems for liver trauma, followed by organ-specific diagnostic, resuscitation, and triage considerations. It will review important limitations, risk factors for failure, and complications associated with nonoperative management and angioembolization. This article presents operative techniques and pearls for surgical treatment of the most severe injuries, including adjuncts for hemorrhage control. Finally, we suggest the 6 Ps as an operative strategy for liver injury: Push-Pack-Pringle-Put Back-Phone-Pivot.

Level Of Evidence

### Transcatheter arterial embolization in a hemodynamically unstable patient with grade IV blunt liver injury: is nonsurgical management an option? [^0e7afbb6]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence of liver injury in patients who have sustained blunt multiple trauma was reported to range from 1 to 8%. Because previous mortality rates were as high as 50–80% for severe hepatic injury, the choice of treatment was under intensive investigation. Whereas nonsurgical management was the standard treatment for the hemodynamically stable patient, there is no consensus on how to treat hemodynamically unstable patients. This report details the case of a patient who sustained blunt multiple trauma, resulting in a grade IV liver injury, graded according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Liver Injury Scale. With massive fluid and blood resuscitation, the patient was stable enough to be managed nonsurgically. With transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), the left and right hepatic arteries were embolized with coils, which allowed for a good recovery. We hypothesize that TAE can be used in the hemodynamically unstable patient who responds to rapid fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion. We caution that there is insufficient evidence until now and would therefore not make any recommendations; however, we would question the need for surgery in unstable patients with this kind of injury in the future.

### Resuscitation strategies with different arterial pressure targets after surgical management of traumatic shock [^d9bec6a3]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypotensive fluid resuscitation has a better effect before and during surgical intervention for multiple trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock. However, it is questionable whether hypotensive fluid resuscitation is suitable after surgical intervention for these patients, and whether resuscitation with different mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets after surgical intervention can obtain different results. The aim of this study was to investigate these questions and to explore the underlying mechanisms.

Methods

A total of 30 anesthetized piglets were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 10 per group): low MAP, middle MAP, and high MAP, which had MAP targets of 60, 80, and 100 mmHg, respectively. All animals underwent femur fracture, intestine and liver injury, haemorrhagic shock, early hypotensive resuscitation, and surgical intervention. Then, the animals received fluid resuscitation with different MAP targets as mentioned above for 24 hours. Hemodynamic parameters and vital organ functions were evaluated.

Results

Fluid resuscitation in the 80 mmHg MAP group maintained haemodynamic stability, tissue perfusion, and organ function better than that in the other groups. The 60 mmHg MAP group presented with profound metabolic acidosis and organ histopathologic damage. In addition, animals in the 100 mmHg MAP group exhibited severe tissue oedema, organ function failure, and histopathologic damage.

Conclusions

In our porcine model of resuscitation, targeting high MAP by fluid administration alone resulted in a huge increase in the infusion volume, severe tissue oedema, and organ dysfunction. Meanwhile, targeting low MAP resulted in persistent tissue hypoperfusion and metabolic stress. Hence, a resuscitation strategy of targeting appropriate MAP might be compatible with maintaining haemodynamic stability, tissue perfusion, and organ function.

### Effects of different types of fluid resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock on splanchnic organ microcirculation and renal reactive oxygen species formation [^57afe45d]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, we compared commonly used resuscitation fluids, namely a crystalloid (0.9% saline), HTS, and synthetic colloids (GEL and HES), in the acute management of hemorrhagic shock. The major findings are that first, we observed that although fluid resuscitation with the crystalloid restored the MAP and decreased the serum lactatemia, intestinal microcirculation was effectively resuscitated only after using the HTS or synthetic colloids; second, fluid resuscitation using the synthetic colloids was associated with the greatest formation of renal ROS in vivo after reperfusion.

Different splanchnic organs may have heterogeneous microcirculatory responses to fluid therapy. For instance, we recently observed that the intestinal microcirculation was more vulnerable to hemorrhaging and had poorer responses to NS resuscitation compared with the liver, kidney, and gracilis muscle. In support of our previous findings, we also observed that during the resuscitation period, the intestinal microcirculation had a more positive response to fluid resuscitation using HTS, GEL, or HES than to that using NS. Our previous and current studies have indicated that the acute microcirculatory response to fluid therapy in susceptible organs such as the intestine is affected not only by volume effects but also by the biochemical composition. Hypertonic fluid and plasma substitutes, especially synthetic colloids, are the most common compositions for correcting hypovolemia in addition to the crystalloid. HTS was proposed to correct microcirculatory dysfunction and inflammatory effects in a hypovolemic state and has been in clinical use for resuscitating hypovolemic and brain injury patients. It was also reported to improve both macrocirculation and microcirculation in comparison with NS and HES during fluid resuscitation in septic shock patients. In previous experimental studies, HTS has improved myocardial blood flow in a pig model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, increased cerebral blood flow in a rat model of cardiac arrest, and reduced mesenteric microcirculatory dysfunction in a rat model of strangulated small bowel obstruction. We additionally found that the microcirculatory blood flow in the serosal muscular layer was the most restored in the HTS group (Figs. 2d and 3d), probably because HTS is more effective in increasing superior mesenteric arterial blood flow and in improving intestinal perfusion with selective vasodilation of precapillary arterioles after hemorrhagic shock. Synthetic colloids have been widely used clinically, and their therapeutic effects on microcirculation have gained substantial attention in human studies. GEL was reported to improve splanchnic perfusion in patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in hypovolemic septic patients. In addition, HES improved gastric mucosal perfusion in patients who received abdominal aortic surgery or liver surgery and improved sublingual microcirculation during early goal-directed therapy for septic patients. However, the effects of synthetic colloids on the microcirculation among multiple splanchnic organs have been less frequently investigated. Our results are in accordance with those of clinical reports indicating that splanchnic microcirculatory blood flow improved after synthetic colloid resuscitation. Synthetic colloids may exert this effect by inducing a decrease in erythrocyte aggregation, thereby reducing the low-shear viscosity of the blood. Despite the microcirculatory advantages of fluid resuscitation using synthetic colloids, concerns remain about the safety of both GEL and HES, mainly an increased risk of acute kidney injury, especially in critically ill patients who are vulnerable to oxidative stress. Moreover, we determined that increased reperfusion-induced renal ROS formation may be a mechanism underlying the risk of kidney injury during fluid resuscitation using synthetic colloids.

### Bicarbonate Ringer's solution could improve the intraoperative acid-base equilibrium and reduce hepatocellular enzyme levels after deceased donor liver transplantation: a randomized controlled study [^10e04d99]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

To overcome these problems, a new type of crystalloid solution, bicarbonate Ringer's (BR) solution has recently been used for fluid resuscitation. Compared to AR solution, BR solution is characterized as a direct liver and kidney metabolism-independent HCO₃⁻ buffering system; therefore, it can more rapidly buffer acid and maintain acid-base balance without increasing the oxygen demand and hepatic burden. Furthermore, Wang et al. reported that BR solution could relieve ischaemia‒reperfusion injury (IRI) in liver cells.

However, whether BR solution is more effective in acid-base equilibrium and more conducive to better liver function than AR solution remains unclear. To date, and to our knowledge, there has been a paucity of evidence in the literature on the comparative influence of AR or BR solutions. Therefore, our primary objective in this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effects of AR or BR solutions infused during surgery and used to prepare the 2% albumin solution for graft washing on pH and base excess (BE) levels in OLT patients. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative 5% sodium bicarbonate infusion incidence and volume, as well as laboratory indicators related to liver and kidney function.

### Resuscitation strategies with different arterial pressure targets after surgical management of traumatic shock [^bf404569]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the different MAP targets for late resuscitation after surgical intervention in piglets that experienced multiple trauma, haemorrhagic shock, early resuscitation, and surgical intervention. Interestingly, there were significant differences in the resuscitation effects among the three study groups. Fluid resuscitation with a MAP target of 80 mmHg obtained better effects in terms of maintaining haemodynamic stability, tissue perfusion, and organ function than a MAP target of 60 or 100 mmHg, and the histopathologic findings showed that the 80 mmHg group had better function and more integral cell and tissue architecture than the 60 and 100 mmHg groups.

There are many models of clinical multiple trauma with haemorrhagic shock, such as pure vascular injury and impairment of the liver and spleen in combination with vascular injury, among others. However, unlike these models, the present model imitates grade III liver injury, intestine perforation, and femur fracture, which may more closely resemble the actual clinical conditions of multiple trauma. Solid and hollow organ damage commonly co-occur, and most solid organ damage is complicated by haemorrhage in multiple trauma cases. In addition, the trauma severity of our model is more clinically meaningful because the presence of very severe trauma, such as major vascular injury and grade IV/V liver injury, is associated with a greater risk of mortality before arriving at the operation room, and milder trauma can generally be cured through conservative treatment. Furthermore, this model mimicked trauma (phase I), emergency room and operation room (phase II), and ICU (phase III) scenarios to investigate the effects of resuscitation using different MAP targets after surgical intervention. During phase II, the MAP target was 60 mmHg, as previous studies have advocated hypotensive resuscitation for early resuscitation for multiple trauma patients with uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock before and during surgical intervention. Mapstone et al. systematically reviewed and analyzed 52 randomized controlled trials of fluid resuscitation in an animal model of haemorrhagic shock. However, most of those trials focused on the outcome of immediate emergency treatment before surgical intervention. A few trials divided the experiment into three phases, but they also studied effects of treatment in the pre-hospital phase. The present study focused on effects of resuscitation strategies after surgical intervention for haemorrhagic shock.

### Treatment of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock after liver trauma: fatal effects of fluid resuscitation versus improved outcome after vasopressin [^5e12ef52]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In a porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, we evaluated the effects of vasopressin versus an equal volume of saline placebo versus fluid resuscitation on hemodynamic variables and short-term survival. Twenty-one anesthetized pigs were subjected to severe liver injury. When mean arterial blood pressure was < 20 mm Hg and heart rate decreased, pigs randomly received either vasopressin IV (0.4 U/kg; n = 7), an equal volume of saline placebo (n = 7), or fluid resuscitation (1000 mL each of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch; n = 7). Thirty minutes after intervention, surviving pigs were fluid resuscitated while bleeding was surgically controlled. Mean (± SEM) arterial blood pressure 5 min after the intervention was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after vasopressin than with saline placebo or fluid resuscitation (58 ± 9 versus 7 ± 3 versus 32 ± 6 mm Hg, respectively). Vasopressin improved abdominal organ blood flow but did not cause further blood loss (vasopressin versus saline placebo versus fluid resuscitation 10 min after intervention, 1343 ± 60 versus 1350 ± 22 versus 2536 ± 93 mL, respectively; P < 0.01). Seven of 7 vasopressin pigs survived until bleeding was controlled and 60 min thereafter, whereas 7 of 7 saline placebo and 7 of 7 fluid resuscitation pigs died (P < 0.01). We conclude that vasopressin, but not saline placebo or fluid resuscitation, significantly improves short-term survival during uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock.

Implications

Although IV fluid administration is the mainstay of nonsurgical management of trauma patients with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, the efficacy of this strategy has been discussed controversially. In this animal model of severe liver trauma with uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, vasopressin, but not saline placebo or fluid resuscitation, improved short-term survival.

Ischemic liver injury — secondary cause of ALF: Ischemic liver injury, also called "hypoxic hepatitis" or "shock liver", results from transient or persistently decreased hepatic perfusion and may occur with congestive heart failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, injury, or major surgery, sometimes without documented hypotension. Patients with ischemia-related ALF can present with a severe hepatocellular injury pattern with marked AST elevation > 10,000 IU/L; bilirubin levels are typically normal initially, often worsening with rising INR despite improvement in transaminase levels, and patients often have rapid clinical improvement with restoration of normal hemodynamic status, with prognosis largely dictated by the underlying illness.

Key messages

Hemorrhagic shock induced heterogeneous splanchnic microcirculatory derangement in the kidney and, particularly, the intestine; by contrast, the liver was less affected
Fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, 3% saline, and synthetic colloids effectively restored microcirculation in the kidney, blood pressure and serum lactate levels in hemorrhagic shock
The intestinal microcirculation was restored using 3% saline and synthetic colloids, but not 0.9% saline
Fluid resuscitation using the synthetic colloids was associated with significantly increased reperfusion-induced formation of renal reactive oxygen species in vivo

### Resuscitation strategies with different arterial pressure targets after surgical management of traumatic shock [^347e8bbf]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lastly, there was no significant difference in secondary blood loss among the groups. This result may be associated with the grade III liver injuries and effective liver packing. However, the risks of re-bleeding after surgical intervention still require attention, and additional research is needed to determine if this result can been generalized to other grades and types of multiple trauma.

The present study has several limitations. First, whether our porcine model accurately reflects multiple trauma and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock in humans requires further confirmation. Second, although we have made an effort to mimic current clinical practice of resuscitation, in reality it is much more complicated and involves several other factors, including vasopressor administration, blood product infusion, and so forth. Further, our experiment used crystalloid fluid alone to resuscitate the animals in order to minimize the effects of any confounding factors. It is unclear whether the results would be similar if the targets of MAP were obtained by a combination of fluid, vasopressors, and blood products. Third, we only observed the effects of different MAP target resuscitations on the pathophysiology during a 24-hour period, and the power was not adequate for survival analysis, owing to the short-term observation and low number of mortality cases (2 out of 30). Therefore, in the future, multivariable long-term clinical studies are needed to validate our conclusions.

### Management of acute liver failure [^ec72cd73]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a syndrome of diverse etiology, in which patients without previously recognized liver disease sustain a liver injury that results in rapid loss of hepatic function. Depending on the etiology and severity of the insult, some patients undergo rapid hepatic regeneration and spontaneously recover. However, nearly 60% of patients with ALF in the US require and undergo orthotopic liver transplantation or die. Management decisions made by clinicians who initially assess individuals with ALF can drastically affect these patients' outcomes. Even with optimal early management, however, many patients with ALF develop a cascade of complications often presaged by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which involves failure of nearly every organ system. We highlight advances in the intensive care management of patients with ALF that have contributed to a marked improvement in their overall survival over the past 20 years. These advances include therapies that limit the extent of liver injury and maximize the likelihood of spontaneous recovery and approaches to enable prevention, recognition and early treatment of complications that lead to multi-organ-system failure, the most common cause of death. Finally, we summarize the role of orthotopic liver transplantation in salvage of the most severely affected patients.

### Hypoxemic versus normoxemic reperfusion in a large animal model of severe ischemia-reperfusion injury [^37ce5ad9]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies have suggested a significant benefit of using deliberate hypoxemia to reperfuse ischemic tissue beds, primarily by reducing free radical injury. We sought to examine the effects of a hypoxemic reperfusion strategy in a large animal model of severe truncal ischemia.

Materials and Methods

Adult swine were subjected to 30 min of supraceliac aortic occlusion and randomized to two groups: normoxemia group (n = 9), with resuscitation at a pO₂ > 100 mmHg or hypoxemia group (n = 10), with initial resuscitation at a pO₂ of 30–50. The two groups were compared using physiologic parameters, fluid and pressor requirements, inflammatory and oxidative markers, and histologic analysis of end-organ injury.

Results

All animals developed significant hemodynamic instability immediately upon reperfusion. Average mean arterial pressure at baseline rose significantly after 30 min of cross-clamp (76.8 versus 166.3 mmHg, P < 0.001). Upon reperfusion, all animals required epinephrine and fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. After stabilization, the two groups were similar in terms of central and pulmonary hemodynamics. The hypoxemic group required more mean total epinephrine (18.35 mg versus 5.28 mg, P < 0.01) with no significant difference in total fluid volume (hypoxemic 9111 mL versus 8420 mL, P = 0.730). The hypoxemic group demonstrated a more severe metabolic acidosis at all time intervals after reperfusion (pH 7.02 versus 7.16 and lactate 17 versus 13, both P < 0.01). There was no difference in malondialdehyde concentration between the two groups, but the hypoxemic group had a higher antioxidant reductive capacity at all intervals after 30 min of reperfusion (0.23 versus 0.27 uM, P = 0.03). While there was significant end-organ damage on pathologic examination of all liver and kidney specimens (mean severity of injury 1.59 and 1.76, respectively, on a scale of 1–3), there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Conclusions

A hypoxemic reperfusion strategy in this large animal model failed to demonstrate any significant clinical benefit. Although there was chemical evidence of improved antioxidant capacity with hypoxemia, it was associated with more instability, metabolic and physiologic derangements, and no evidence of end-organ protection.

### Effects of different types of fluid resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock on splanchnic organ microcirculation and renal reactive oxygen species formation [^3fea6b2e]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fluid resuscitation is an indispensable procedure in the acute management of hemorrhagic shock for restoring tissue perfusion, particularly microcirculation in splanchnic organs. Resuscitation fluids include crystalloids, hypertonic saline (HTS), and synthetic colloids, and their selection affects the recovery of microcirculatory blood flow and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which is often evident in the kidney, following reperfusion. In this study, the effects of acute resuscitation with 0.9% saline (NS), 3% HTS, 4% succinylated gelatin (GEL), and 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 were compared in a hemorrhagic shock rat model to analyze restoration of microcirculation among various splanchnic organs and the gracilis muscle and reperfusion-induced renal ROS formation.

Methods

A total of 96 male Wistar rats were subjected to sham operation (sham group), hemorrhagic shock (control group), and resuscitation with NS, HTS, GEL and HES. Two hours after resuscitation, changes in the mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum lactate level and the microcirculatory blood flow among various splanchnic organs, namely the liver, kidney, and intestine (mucosa, serosal muscular layer, and Peyer's patch), and the gracilis muscle, were compared using laser speckle contrast imaging. Renal ROS formation after reperfusion was investigated using an enhanced in vivo chemiluminescence (CL) method.

Results

Microcirculatory blood flow was less severely affected by hemorrhaging in the liver and gracilis muscle. Impairment of microcirculation in the kidney was restored in all resuscitation groups. Resuscitation in the NS group failed to restore intestinal microcirculation. Resuscitation in the HTS, GEL, and HES groups restored intestinal microcirculatory blood flow. By comparison, fluid resuscitation restored hemorrhagic shock-induced hypotension and decreased lactatemia in all resuscitation groups. Reperfusion-induced in vivo renal ROS formation was significantly higher in the GEL and HES groups than in the other groups.

Conclusion

Although fluid resuscitation with NS restored the MAP and decreased lactatemia following hemorrhagic shock, intestinal microcirculation was restored only by other volume expanders, namely 3% HTS, GEL, and HES. However, reperfusion-induced renal ROS formation was significantly higher when synthetic colloids were used.

### Updated APSA guidelines for the management of blunt liver and spleen injuries [^698aea85]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-operative management of blunt liver and spleen injuries was championed initially in children with the first management guideline published in 2000 by the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA). Multiple articles have expanded on the original guidelines and additional therapy has been investigated to improve care for these patients. Based on a literature review and current consensus, the management guidelines for the treatment of blunt liver and spleen injuries are presented.

Methods

A recent literature review by the APSA Outcomes committee [2] was utilized as the basis for the guideline recommendations. A task force was assembled from the APSA Committee on Trauma to review the original guidelines, the literature reported by the Outcomes Committee and then to develop an easy to implement guideline.

Results

The updated guidelines for the management of blunt liver and spleen injuries are divided into 4 sections: Admission, Procedures, Set Free and Aftercare. Admission to the intensive care unit is based on abnormal vital signs after resuscitation with stable patients admitted to the ward with minimal restrictions. Procedure recommendations include transfusions for low hemoglobin (< 7 mg/dL) or signs of ongoing bleeding. Angioembolization and operative exploration is limited to those patients with clinical signs of continued bleeding after resuscitation. Discharge is based on clinical condition and not grade of injury. Activity restrictions remain the same while follow-up imaging is only indicated for symptomatic patients.

Conclusion

The updated APSA guidelines for the management of blunt liver and spleen injuries present an easy-to-follow management strategy for children.

### Cirrhosis: diagnosis and management… [^992bd9e3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Newer guidelines suggest targeted screening for esophageal varices in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension rather than screening all patients with cirrhosis. Pathophysiology and Natural History of Cirrhosis Chronic liver injury causes inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Regardless of the cause, this can lead to the formation of fibrous septae and nodules, collapse of liver structures, and distortion of hepatic parenchyma and vascular architecture. Progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis subsequently result in decreased metabolic and synthetic hepatic function, causing a rise in bilirubin and decreased production of clotting factors and thrombopoietin, as well as splenic platelet sequestration, increased portal pressure, and the development of ascites and esophageal varices. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that even early cirrhosis is reversible.

11 Studies have demonstrated biopsy-proven fibrosis improvement rates as high as 88% after antiviral treatment in patients with HBV and HCV and as high as 85% after bariatric surgery in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 12, 13. After cirrhosis is established, a patient may remain clinically stable, or compensated, for years. Patients with compensated cirrhosis caused by HBV, HCV, and alcoholic liver disease develop clinical signs of decompensation, which include ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or bleeding, at a rate of 4% to 10% per year. 14 Variability of disease progression is influenced by the underlying cause and the presence or absence of treatment and ongoing liver injury. The median survival for those with compensated cirrhosis is 12 years, compared with two years once decompensation occurs.
15. Consultation Varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and ascites herald hepatic decompensation; these conditions warrant referral for subspecialist evaluation.

The management of acute or refractory complications of cirrhosis is best addressed in the inpatient or referral setting. This article updates previous articles on this topic by Starr and Raines, Heidelbaugh and Bruderly, 56 and Riley and Bhatti. 57 58.

### Efficacy of compound sodium acetate Ringer's solution in early fluid resuscitation for children with septic shock: a preliminary retrospective cohort study [^a59f7496]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Septic shock is a critical illness in children with remarkable morbidity and mortality rates, often ranking among the primary causes of death in pediatric intensive care units. Given these high stakes, early and effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for restoring tissue perfusion and enhancing hemodynamic stability. This intervention plays a fundamental role in reducing mortality associated with pediatric septic shock. In this context, the selection of an appropriate resuscitation fluid is of utmost importance. Normal saline is the most commonly used resuscitation solution in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness and widespread availability. However, its use may lead to side effects such as hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and other internal environmental imbalances, increasing the risk of septic shock, kidney injury, and death. Given these concerns, balanced salt solutions, which contain a weak acid buffer system and an electrolyte composition similar to that of the extracellular fluid, are currently recommended as the preferred resuscitation fluid in septic shock guidelines. Among these, lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is more effective than normal saline in reducing the occurrence of hyperchloremia. Nevertheless, it poses challenges due to lactate accumulation, especially in patients with pre-existing high lactate levels in septic shock. This lactate accumulation not only complicates the assessment of tissue perfusion after shock resuscitation under lactate monitoring but also strains the liver and increases the risk of myocardial damage. Consequently, LR may not be an ideal choice among balanced salt solutions. A modified compound known as acetated Ringer's solution (AR), which is devoid of chloride ions or lactic acid and enriched with magnesium, calcium, potassium, and glucose, is conducive to the internal environment. Acetic acid metabolizes rapidly, twice as fast as lactic acid, and has high buffering efficiency. Its metabolism relies on the tricarboxylic acid cycle in tissue cells, especially in muscles, reducing liver burden. It has demonstrated its superiority in fluid therapy for severe burns and myocardial reperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. Studies in adults have indicated its potential to improve survival rates and prognosis in septic shock compared to normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. However, research on its efficacy in pediatric septic shock is limited. Therefore, this study aims to retrospectively analyze the clinical efficacy of compound AR in fluid resuscitation for pediatric septic shock, providing insights into selecting appropriate resuscitation fluid types for this patient population.

### Regulated hepatic reperfusion mitigates ischemia-reperfusion injury and improves survival after prolonged liver warm ischemia: a pilot study on a novel concept of organ resuscitation in a large animal model [^693503e1]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can occur during hepatic surgery and transplantation. IRI causes hepatic mitochondrial and microcirculatory impairment, resulting in acute liver dysfunction and failure. We proposed a novel strategy of regulated hepatic reperfusion (RHR) to reverse the cellular metabolic deficit that incurred during organ ischemia by using a substrate-enriched, oxygen-saturated, and leukocyte-depleted perfusate delivered under regulated reperfusion pressure, temperature, and pH. We investigate the use of RHR in mitigating IRI after a prolonged period of warm ischemia.

Methods

Using a 2-hour liver warm ischemia swine model, 2 methods of liver reperfusion were compared. The control group (n = 6) received conventional reperfusion with unmodified portal venous blood under unregulated reperfusion pressure, temperature, and pH. The experimental group (n = 6) received RHR. We analyzed the effects of RHR on post-reperfusion hemodynamic changes, liver function, and 7-day animal survival.

Results

RHR resulted in 100% survival compared with 50% in the control group (p = 0.05). Post-reperfusion syndrome was not observed in the RHR group, but it occurred in 83% of the control group. RHR resulted in a lesser degree of change from baseline serum alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase after reperfusion compared with the control group. Histopathologic evaluation showed minimal ischemic changes in the RHR group, whereas a considerable degree of coagulative hepatocellular necrosis was observed in the control group.

Conclusions

Regulated hepatic reperfusion mitigates IRI, facilitates liver function recovery, and improves survival after a prolonged period of hepatic warm ischemia. This novel strategy has potential applicability to clinical hepatic surgery and liver transplantation when marginal grafts are used.

### Damage-control resuscitation increases successful nonoperative management rates and survival after severe blunt liver injury [^31f2660a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nonoperative multidisciplinary management for severe (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Grades IV and V) liver injury has been used for two decades. We have previously shown that Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR) using low-volume, balanced resuscitation improves survival of severely injured trauma patients; however, little attention has been paid to organ-specific outcomes. We wanted to determine if implementation of DCR has improved survival and successful nonoperative management after severe blunt liver injury.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed on all adult trauma patients with severe blunt liver injury who were admitted from 2005 to 2011. Patients were divided into pre-DCR (2005–2008) and DCR (2009–2011) groups. Patients who died before leaving the emergency department (ED) were excluded. Outcomes (resuscitation products used, survival, and length of stay) were then compared by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Between 2005 and 2011, 29,801 adult trauma patients were admitted, and 1,412 (4.7%) experienced blunt liver injury. Of these, 244 (17%) sustained Grade IV and V injuries, with 206 patients surviving to leave the ED. The pre-DCR group (2005–2008) was composed of 108 patients, and the DCR group (2009–2011) had 98 patients. The groups were not different in demographics as well as prehospital and ED vital signs or Injury Severity Score (ISS). No change in operative or interventional radiology techniques occurred in this time frame. The DCR cohort had an increase in successful nonoperative management (from 54% to 74%, p < 0.01) as well as a reduction in initial 24-hour packed red blood cell (median, from 13 U to 6.5 U; p < 0.01), plasma (median, from 13 U to 8 U; p < 0.01), and crystalloid (median, from 5,800 mL to 4,100 mL; p < 0.01) administration. The DCR treatment was associated with improved survival, from 73% to 94% (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

In patients with severe blunt liver injury, DCR was associated with less crystalloid and blood product use, a higher successful nonoperative management rate, and improved survival. Resuscitation technique may improve outcomes after severe liver injury.

### Causes of death after fluid bolus resuscitation: new insights from FEAST [^c4b4c219]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST study) was an extremely well conducted study that gave unexpected results. The investigators had reported that febrile children with impaired perfusion treated in low-income countries without access to intensive care are more likely to die if they receive bolus resuscitation with albumin or saline compared with no bolus resuscitation at all. In a secondary analysis of the trial, published in BMC Medicine, the authors found that increased mortality was evident in patients who presented with clinical features of severe shock in isolation or in conjunction with features of respiratory or neurological failure. The cause of excess deaths was primarily refractory shock and not fluid overload. These features are consistent with a potential cardiotoxic or ischemia-reperfusion injury following resuscitation with boluses of intravenous fluid. Although these effects may have been amplified by the absence of invasive monitoring, mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, the results provide compelling insights into the effects of intravenous fluid resuscitation and potential adverse effects that extend beyond the initial resuscitation period. These data add to the increasing body of literature about the safety and efficacy of intravenous resuscitation fluids, which may be applicable to management of other populations of critically ill patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^c40cae60]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Prevention and treatment of AKI — KDOQI aligns with key KDIGO recommendations and fluid choices: the section includes 7 level 1 recommendations and 22 level 2 recommendations, and our KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 7 level 1 recommendations; the Work Group agreed with using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion in patients at risk of AKI or with AKI and noted harm with starch-containing colloids, therefore these solutions should be avoided; albumin resuscitation has been associated with harm in traumatic brain injury and should be avoided in that setting; in liver disease, intravenous albumin appears to be beneficial for prevention of renal failure and death in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and for prevention of renal failure in large-volume paracentesis; diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome include lack of improvement after volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg/d up to 100 g/d) for at least 2 days and withdrawal of diuretic therapy; avoidance of nephrotoxins is not always possible given pathogen resistance examples.

### The effects of hemorrhagic shock secondary to hepatectomy in a swine model [^8235776d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by severe hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation leads to deterioration of hepatic homeostasis and possibly to liver failure. The present study focuses on determining whether there is a different biological response to hemorrhagic shock by different sources of hemorrhage, hepatic hemorrhage (HH) versus peripheral hemorrhage.

Methods

Twenty-one male swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) were randomly allocated in three groups as follows: sham group (S, n = 5), central venous hemorrhage group, (CVH) (n = 8), and HH group (n = 8). Hepatectomy of the left liver lobe was carried out in groups CVH and HH, and the animals were subjected to controlled bleeding from the internal jugular vein and the traumatic liver surface, respectively. After 10 min of hemorrhage, shock was maintained for 30 min at mean arterial pressure levels of 30 mm Hg-40 mm Hg and resuscitation was initiated with crystalloids and colloids. Hemodynamic parameters and fluid balance were monitored throughout the 6 h of total duration of the experiment. Blood samples were collected at 0-, 40-, and 360-min time points for transaminases, albumin, and interleukin-6 measurement. Hepatic tissue was harvested at the end of the experiment for oxidative marker and proliferation analysis.

Results

Although blood loss was comparable between the two groups, the amount of fluids needed for resuscitation was higher for the HH group. Inflammatory response, measured by interleukin-6, was found higher in HH group. Oxidative stress markers did not reveal statistically significant difference between the two groups. Liver hemorrhage decreased hepatocellular proliferation measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

Conclusions

Our study provides evidence that HH entails worse consequences for the hepatocytes than systemic hemorrhage. Higher needs for resuscitation fluids, decreased proliferation, and augmented inflammatory response when HH takes place are findings with possible clinical importance in liver surgery and trauma.

### Resuscitation strategies with different arterial pressure targets after surgical management of traumatic shock [^af96edae]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The present study demonstrated that middle MAP resuscitation after surgical intervention showed better effects than low or high MAP resuscitation. Low MAP resuscitation cannot meet the basic demand of tissue perfusion, as compared to middle MAP resuscitation. Previous studies have shown that a short duration of targeted hypotensive resuscitation appears safe and may improve outcomes, owing to reduced re-bleeding. In addition, hypotensive resuscitation has become the accepted strategy for pre-hospital resuscitation of trauma casualties suffering hypovolemic shock. However, hypotensive resuscitation is not without a physiologic penalty: longer targeted hypotensive resuscitation duration (over two to three hours) may lead to reduced tissue perfusion and the development of metabolic acidosis, cellular injury, and organ dysfunction, as shown in the present study. Further, the global blood flow (the CI) during late resuscitation was the lowest in the low MAP group. In turn, this led to the DO₂, but not CaO₂ levels, also being the lowest in this group during late resuscitation. Moreover, the low DO 2 caused the nadir in VO₂ as well, even though the O₂ ER during late resuscitation was the highest in the low MAP group, at approximately 70%. Thus, the low MAP group persistently had the lowest ABE and highest plasma lactate levels during late resuscitation, indicating profound metabolic acidosis. The peak levels of AST, ALT, BUN, and creatinine in the low MAP group at the end of the experiment suggested acute hepatic and renal failure. In accordance with these findings, the histopathologic changes in the liver, kidneys, ileum, and lungs suggested pathophysiologic consequences of persistent metabolic stress. Collectively, this indicates that low MAP target resuscitation should not last too long or be extended to late resuscitation after surgical intervention in the ICU.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Hemodynamic monitoring during resuscitation in cirrhosis/ACLF emphasizes that ongoing accurate monitoring of hemodynamic and circulatory status must be continued during fluid resuscitation to guide appropriate therapy and avoid overresuscitation; dynamic changes in stroke volume, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or transthoracic echocardiography with fluid boluses or passive leg raise may help guide resuscitation, and given a dearth of ACLF data, a significant amount of cardiovascular/shock guidance is extrapolated from the general critical care literature.

### Ischaemia-reperfusion injury in liver transplantation – from bench to bedside [^168ab5a7]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in the liver, a major complication of haemorrhagic shock, resection and transplantation, is a dynamic process that involves the two interrelated phases of local ischaemic insult and inflammation-mediated reperfusion injury. This Review highlights the latest mechanistic insights into innate-adaptive immune crosstalk and cell activation cascades that lead to inflammation-mediated injury in livers stressed by ischaemia-reperfusion, discusses progress in large animal experiments and examines efforts to minimize liver IRI in patients who have received a liver transplant. The interlinked signalling pathways in multiple hepatic cell types, the IRI kinetics and positive versus negative regulatory loops at the innate-adaptive immune interface are discussed. The current gaps in our knowledge and the pathophysiology aspects of IRI in which basic and translational research is still required are stressed. An improved appreciation of cellular immune events that trigger and sustain local inflammatory responses, which are ultimately responsible for organ injury, is fundamental to developing innovative strategies for treating patients who have received a liver transplant and developed ischaemia-reperfusion inflammation and organ dysfunction.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^8ca442cf]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Initial resuscitation fluid management

Background

Fluid resuscitation of trauma patients has been an ongoing challenge, constantly reviewed and debated, resulting in recommendations changing for the use of crystalloids/colloids/packed red blood cells/warm fresh whole blood and clotting factors. Other challenges, such as limited resources, impact the practitioners' choice of fluid — the best fluid available does not always equate to the best fluid for the patient, especially where long transfers and no blood availability are concerned. These decisions and management strategies appear relevant for further discussion and research, as this fluid resuscitation attempts to provide adequate organ perfusion and oxygen delivery in a system compromised by the physiological consequences of injury. Several questions have arisen from this topic: Which fluid is best, how much should be given, and do specific injuries call for different strategies (for example, penetrating vs. blunt trauma)? Achieving balance in the resuscitation period is challenging, particularly the volume administered. More fluid is not always better, in fact, quite the contrary. Much of the literature on fluid resuscitation focuses on critically ill patients with sepsis, or elective perioperative patients. Small cohorts of trauma patients can be found in the larger studies, but it should be remembered that most of these data include patients from the ICU setting. Extrapolation of data to the initial resuscitation phase of the trauma patient is not possible. This article emphasizes different types of fluid available, when they should be used, and recommendations on how to tailor fluid resuscitation through monitoring techniques. The goals of improving physiology, restoring or maintaining normothermia and minimizing coagulopathy should be considered paramount throughout the discussion.

### Resuscitation of haemorrhagic shock with normal saline vs. lactated ringer' s: effects on oxygenation, extravascular lung water and haemodynamics [^29dbeef1]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Results

One animal in the NS group did not survive the two-hour study. All the animals in the LR group survived. Composite MAP of the two groups throughout the study are shown in Figure 1. The grade V liver injury caused rapid blood loss and a rapid drop in blood pressure. On reaching a nadir blood pressure, bleeding spontaneously stopped in all animals. This was followed by a period of spontaneous increase in blood pressure that was augmented after 30 minutes with active resuscitation using either NS or LR (randomised) to baseline MAP. Despite receiving a larger resuscitation volume in an attempt to maintain target blood pressure, the average MAP during the resuscitation phase was significantly lower in the NS group (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. LR 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg, p = 0.01). Although all the animals received large resuscitations, no animal in either group developed signs of abdominal compartment syndrome such as difficulty in maintaining adequate ventilation or decreased urine output.

Figure 1
Blood pressure curves for experimental groups. This graph is a composite of the mean arterial pressures of the two resuscitation groups. The liver injury is created at time zero. Fluid resuscitation was begun at 30 minutes into the experiment. There is no difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between the two groups until resuscitation. Despite being given significantly more fluid, mean arterial pressures of the animals five the normal saline (NS) was significantly lower than the lactated Ringer's solution (LR) group beginning 39 minutes into the resuscitation (NS 56.9 ± 1.6 mmHg vs. LR 64.0 ± 2.0 mmHg; ✱ p = 0.01)) and remaining so until close to study end.

Mean urine output and blood loss were greater in the NS group than in the LR group. Urine output was 44.1 ml/kg ± 8.1 in the NS group vs. 19.4 ml/kg ± 3.4 ml/kg in the LR group (p = 0.012), and total blood loss was 34.3 ± 2.9 ml/kg vs. 23.7 ± 2.1 ml/kg (p = 0.009). The NS group required almost twice as much fluid (NS 330.8 ± 38.1 ml/kg vs. LR 148.4 ± 20.2 ml/kg; p = 0.009) over the 90-minute resuscitation period in an attempt to maintain goal MAP. There was no difference in blood loss prior to fluid resuscitation.

Acute liver failure hemodynamic management — To optimize neurological recovery after ALF, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) must be raised to avoid cerebral underperfusion and anoxia; in hypotensive patients, intravascular volume should be replaced first with normal saline and thereafter norepinephrine should be used to increase MAP to 60–80 mm Hg; vasopressin or terlipressin is often added but was reported to increase intracranial pressure (ICP) in ALF, although more recent data suggest vasopressin and analogous drugs increase cerebral perfusion without increasing ICP and may be used safely as an adjunct to norepinephrine.

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, pulmonary and renal considerations: executive summary [^d946a566]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — hemodynamic management in acute liver failure (ALF) or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) includes: We recommend against using hydroxyethyl starch for initial fluid resuscitation of patients with ALF or ACLF. We suggest against using gelatin solutions for initial fluid resuscitation of patients with ALF or ACLF. We suggest using albumin for resuscitation of patients with ALF or ACLF over other fluids, especially when serum albumin is low (< 3 mg/dL). We suggest targeting a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg in patients with ALF or ACLF, with concomitant assessment of perfusion. We suggest placing an arterial catheter for blood pressure monitoring in patients with ALF or ACLF and shock. We suggest using invasive hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy in patients with ALF or ACLF and clinically impaired perfusion. We recommend using norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor in patients with ALF or ACLF who remain hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, or those with profound hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion even if fluid resuscitation is ongoing. We suggest adding low-dose vasopressin to norepinephrine in patients with ALF or ACLF who remain hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation to increase blood pressure.

### How to manage: acute liver failure [^f5ed411b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but life-threatening clinical syndrome with a broad range of causes. Significant improvements in outcome have occurred over the last 50 years, resulting not only from incremental improvements in specialist critical care and a step-change following the introduction of transplantation for this indication, but also better and more effective treatment started early at the site of first presentation.1 2 Emergency liver transplantation (LTx) remains an important intervention and the decision regarding the need for LTx remains key to management, though non-transplant therapies now appear effective for many causes of the condition. In this short review, we will outline issues in the recognition and management of ALF and ongoing challenges in its treatment.

### Effects of different types of fluid resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock on splanchnic organ microcirculation and renal reactive oxygen species formation [^9efb63e1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

An ideal resuscitation fluid should not only be effective in restoring both macrocirculation and microcirculation but also cause less reperfusion injury. Recently, Chen and colleague reported that fluid resuscitation with HES 130/0.4 after hemorrhagic shock was associated with lesser oxidative stress and a less severe inflammatory response in the liver, intestine, lungs, and brain compared with GEL and HES 200/0.5. By contrast, in the current study, increased formation of renal ROS was evident after fluid resuscitation using GEL and HES for hemorrhagic shock. The differences are likely related to two aspects. First, the comparison among resuscitation fluids was not limited to synthetic colloids in the current study; particularly, HTS was included in the comparison. Second, the target organ was different. ROS formation in the kidney was emphasized in the current study because infusion of GEL and, particularly, HES is associated with acute kidney injury. ROS have an extremely short lifetime, and there are various antioxidants in vivo. Therefore, a general method for detecting the products of lipid peroxidation, such as malondialdehyde, in tissue may be insufficiently sensitive for detecting acute changes in ROS during reperfusion through fluid resuscitation. In the current study, to evaluate ROS production, we used an enhanced CL method that is highly sensitive for detecting acute changes in ROS. Greater reperfusion-induced ROS formation than that induced by ischemia may be inevitable after effective microcirculatory restoration; accordingly, greater ROS formation was observed in the HTS, GEL, and HES groups than in the control and NS groups. However, the higher reperfusion-induced ROS may not be completely explained by more effective microcirculatory restoration, because HTS was comparably effective in restoring splanchnic microcirculation but did not induce higher renal ROS formation than the synthetic colloids. It may be because of the anti-inflammatory properties of HTS. Studies have reported that using HTS is associated with less neutrophil activation and less expression of genes implicated in leukocyte–endothelium interaction. However, our results should be cautiously applied to clinical scenarios, because there are differences in susceptibility to oxidative challenge between rats and humans. Rodents may be more resistant to the pathological effects of nitrosative stress, but humans may have evolved counter-regulatory mechanisms. Additional investigations may be warranted for understanding the extent of renal ROS formation caused by using synthetic colloids in clinical settings.

### A systematic review on predictors of postreperfusion hyperkalemia during liver transplantation [^b306c765]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

According to results, the graft type significantly influences the occurrence of early PRHK, with the histological characteristics of DCD grafts contributing to their susceptibility to hyperkalemia. The macrosteatotic feature of DCD graft liver creates more conducive conditions for PRHK development. Typically, DCD grafts experience a warm ischemia period, which leads to a rapid depletion of intracellular energy stores, such as adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). This depletion worsens ischemia/reperfusion injury and hypoxic damage to hepatocytes, resulting in potassium release from damaged cells. Additionally, factors such as graft hypoperfusion due to systemic circulation volume deficits in DCD donors, vasopressor use during donor ICU management, and the mandatory 5-minute waiting period after asystole before procurement further aggravate warm ischemic injury in DCD grafts compared to DBD grafts. The similar incidence of PRHK between DCD and DBD groups in some studies may be attributed to the stringent criteria applied for selecting liver grafts and patients. Moreover, the absence of potassium level measurements during the initial reperfusion period, which typically peaks between 30 s to one minute after reperfusion, may have impacted the results. Further research is necessary to identify the variables that could influence the occurrence of PRHK in recipients of circulatory death donors.

We found that, despite the scientific rationale behind the different compositions of two commonly used preservation solutions, UW and HTK, their clinical relevance to liver transplant outcomes, such as postreperfusion hyperkalemia (PRHK), is often questioned due to a lack of adequately powered, prospective randomized trials. A study by Juang et al. noted that the UW preservation solution did not adversely affect changes in serum potassium levels. Flushing the liver graft using the portal vein flushing (PVF) technique with chilled 5% albumin or saline before reperfusion has been recommended as an effective method to reduce the potassium released by the liver graft during reperfusion. However, few studies have focused on the appropriate type and volume of flush fluid that effectively washes out preservation solutions. According to research by B. Homvises, a minimum of 500 mL of albumin flush is recommended to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia and postreperfusion syndrome.

### Mannitol for prevention of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation: a randomized controlled trial [^fe05cfe0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients' preparation and anesthesia

All patients fasted for 6 h preoperatively for solids and were encouraged to freely drink water up to 4 h preoperatively with an infusion of 500 mL Ringer's acetate during the fasting period.

Baseline recipients' characteristics and laboratory data were collected 24 h before the operation. Donor age and gender were recorded in the study after considering the donors' data. General anesthesia was induced by intravenous (IV) fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, propofol 1–2 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.8–1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane in 40%–60% oxygen in addition to a fentanyl infusion of 0.5–1 mcg/kg/h and rocuronium bromide 200–400 mcg/kg/h. All the patients were kept warm by forced-air warming blankets.

Invasive arterial blood cannula and pulmonary artery catheter were inserted for continuous intraoperative cardiac output (CO) and temperature monitoring (ABBOTT, critical care systems, USA).

Ringer's acetate was used as the maintenance solution. Our center adopted a goal-directed fluid protocol in LDLT and targeted to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mmHg. Patients with stroke volume variation (SVV) > 10% were considered fluid responders and received boluses of 200 mL albumin 4% in Ringer's acetate. The hemoglobin concentration threshold for red blood cells (RBCs) transfusion was 7–8 g/dL according to the clinical judgment. Norepinephrine infusion was started in fluid non-responders.

Random blood glucose was kept between 110 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL by intravenous insulin infusion or boluses of 10% or 25% glucose solution as appropriate. Also, serum potassium (K⁺) and ionized calcium (Ca²⁺) levels were monitored and corrected if needed, especially around the reperfusion phase.

Mannitol and reperfusion

The graft preservation time was minimized by synchronizing the surgical steps of both recipient and donor operations. It was flushed with 3–4 L of cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (Custodial, Bensheim, Germany) via antegrade flushing of the portal vein (without flushing via the hepatic artery) to get completely clear fluid after excision of the donor's right liver lobe.

The study solution was infused for over 20 min at the beginning of warm ischemia. The right hepatic vein was unclamped, followed by the portal vein, and then the graft preservative contents were washed into the systemic circulation by the portal blood.

### Surgical management of AAST grades III-V hepatic trauma by damage control surgery with perihepatic packing and definitive hepatic repair-single centre experience [^c285ddf1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This is the retrospective study of 121 trauma patients with severe hepatic trauma, who have been admitted and operated at Clinic of Emergency Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, from November 2008 to January 2015. This study has been performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Sebia with a reference number 1533/21.

Severe liver injuries were graded according to the American Association for the surgery of Trauma (AAST) - Organ Injury Scale (OIS) as liver trauma grades III, IV and V. Hemodynamically stable patients who had AAST grade I-II liver injury, treated by Non Operative Management (NOM) were not included in study.

Upon arrival at the emergency room of the trauma patient with uncontrolled hemorrhage, the main goal was identification of the sources of bleeding, followed by prompt bleeding control and resuscitation in order to restore tissue perfusion and to achieve haemodynamic stability. After complete, targeted and very fast clinical examination, Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is the first tool used as to see the presence of free fluid (means hemoperitoneum) and associated solid organ injury. In hemodynamically unstable Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) was performed following a negative FAST scan in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma for rapid diagnosis of abdominal injury requiring emergency laparotomy. Initial MSCT of thorax and abdomen in order to determine the severity of the liver trauma and the presence of associated injuries, was done in haemodynamic stable patients. Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) used for evaluation the severity of associated CNS and head injury, by measuring three parameters (motor response, verbal response and eye opening response) range was from 0 (brain death) to the maximum score of 15 for normal cerebral function. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) as an anatomical scoring system providing an overall score for trauma patients with multiple injuries. Each injury is assigned an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score and is allocated to one of the six body regions (Head, Face, Chest, Abdomen, Extremities (including Pelvis), External). The ISS score takes values from 0 to 75 (lethal injury).

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: neurology, peri-transplant medicine, infectious disease, and gastroenterology considerations [^a92be7e1]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Peri-transplant — fluid management of deceased donors: We suggest either using goal-directed fluid management for the deceased organ donor or standard fluid management strategies (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Goal-directed fluid management refers to management directed by invasive hemodynamic monitoring (measurement of filling pressures, cardiac output, and central venous oximetry), whereas standard fluid management is based on clinical assessment of peripheral perfusion (e.g., capillary refill time). Compared with standard management, goal-directed fluid management is associated with negligible desirable effects (1 per 1,000 absolute reduction in mortality, range 24 fewer to 33 more deaths) and a small likelihood of undesirable effects due to delays or complications.

### Surviving sepsis: updated guidelines from the society of… [^066d98ad]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Subsequent resuscitation depends on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion.

Static measures such as heart rate, central venous pressure, and systolic blood pressure are poor indicators of fluid status, and using dynamic measures reduces mortality with a risk ratio of 0.
59. Dynamic measures of fluid status include cardiac output measurement during passive leg raising, stroke volume measurement in response to fluid challenges or changes in intrathoracic pressure, and changes in pulse pressure or systolic blood pressure in response to fluid challenges. Although lactate levels often will not decrease to normal, levels approaching normal suggest successful resuscitation. Normalization of capillary refill time can also demonstrate resuscitation. If vasopressors are necessary after initial fluid resuscitation, the target mean arterial pressure is 65 mm Hg because higher targets do not improve survival. Vasopressors should be started peripherally rather than waiting for central venous access.

Arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential and carries low risks of limb ischemia and bleeding. Intensive care admission should be completed within six hours because mortality increases when emergency department stays exceed that time frame. When beta-lactam antibiotics are used, prolonged intravenous infusions after an initial bolus improve antibiotic concentrations over intermittent boluses and reduce short-term mortality. Source Control Controlling the source of infection, including abscess drainage, necrotic tissue debridement, and removing potentially infective devices, is key in management of sepsis. Source control improves survival and is recommended after initial resuscitation.

### Intensive care management of acute-on-chronic liver failure [^b023353f]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of acute-on-chronic liver failure combines deterioration of liver function in a patient with chronic liver disease, with the development of extrahepatic organ failure and high short-term mortality. Its successful management demands a rapid and coherent response to the development of dysfunction and failure of multiple organ systems in an intensive care unit setting. This response recognises the features that distinguish it from other critical illness and addresses the complex interplay between the precipitating insult, the many organ systems involved and the disordered physiology of underlying chronic liver disease. An evidence base is building to support the approaches currently adopted and outcomes for patients with this condition are improving, but mortality remains unacceptably high. Herein, we review practical considerations in critical care management, as well as discussing key knowledge gaps and areas of controversy that require further focussed research.

### Effect of a combined drug approach on the severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplant: a randomized clinical trial [^2296699c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver transplant is a life-saving therapy for liver failure, but its success is limited by a marked shortage of organs and high mortality among individuals on the waiting list. Attempts to improve this imbalance have led to less restrictive organ donation criteria and an expansion of the donor pool with so-called extended-criteria donors, including donors of more advanced age, donors with steatotic livers, donation after circulatory death (DCD), and donor livers exposed to prolonged static cold ischemia time (CIT).

Livers from extended-criteria donors are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), the principal cause of liver graft dysfunction and primary nonfunction after liver transplant. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a self-amplifying process involving 2 interrelated phases of ischemic and reperfusion injury. The ischemic insult is characterized by a dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, sinusoidal endothelial cell barrier impairment and Kupffer cell activation, activation of cell death programs, and alterations in expression of genes, such as hypoxia-inducible factor. At reperfusion, the mitochondrial burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overburdens the endogenous antioxidant capacity, and ATP depletion deepens, all contributing to cell death. The subsequent expression of danger-associated molecule patterns activates innate immune responses that promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and complement and coagulation factors. Ischemia-reperfusion injury invariably results in local damage that may lead to graft dysfunction, ischemic cholangiopathy (IC), and remote organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Since IRI is associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, finding strategies to effectively mitigate IRI is considered a research priority in the field of liver transplantation.

### Preconditioning, organ preservation, and postconditioning to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury to the liver [^22f2795b]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Ischemia and reperfusion lead to injury of the liver. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is inevitable in liver transplantation and trauma and, to a great extent, in liver resection. This article gives an overview of the mechanisms involved in this type of injury and summarizes protective and treatment strategies in clinical use today. Intervention is possible at different time points: during harvesting, during the period of preservation, and during implantation. Liver preconditioning and postconditioning can be applied in the transplant setting and for liver resection. Graft optimization is merely possible in the period between the harvest and the implantation. Given that there are 3 stages in which a surgeon can intervene against ischemia-reperfusion injury, we have structured the review as follows. The first section reviews the approaches using surgical interventions, such as ischemic preconditioning, as well as pharmacological applications. In the second section, static organ preservation and machine perfusion are addressed. Finally, the possibility of treating the recipient or postconditioning is discussed.

### Pulse oximetry-based capillary refilling evaluation predicts postoperative outcomes in liver transplantation: a prospective observational cohort study [^ada2189d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with a large amount of ascites, close monitoring of the in–out balance and optimal adjustment of fluid administration, which can be achieved in the ICU, is necessary. This may explain the correlation between the length of ICU stay and the amount of ascites present. Although management regarding ICU stay may differ in each country, several Japanese studies reported similar lengths of ICU and hospital stays to this study. It should be noted that other treatments, such as colloid and pressor administration, nutritional support, and antimicrobial agents against infection, should be conducted properly, in addition to a large of fluid resuscitation for perioperative management in liver transplantation.

This study demonstrated that Q-CRT and ΔA b measured immediately after transplantation surgery could identify the patients who would potentially require highly intensive care due to the development of considerable postoperative ascites. Furthermore, it was shown that portal blood flow was associated with Q-CRT and ΔA b, and that the closer to normal range was, the less postoperative ascites. Several possible mechanisms may explain this finding. First, Q-CRT and ΔA b can detect a decrease in peripheral perfusion resulting from preoperative liver failure. It is known that a reduction in systemic vascular resistance due to primary arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation is observed in patients with liver cirrhosis. Activated vasodilator factors such as nitric oxide and endogenous cannabinoids before surgery might exhibit some impact even immediately after transplantation surgery on peripheral tissue perfusion. Second, Q-CRT and ΔA b may indicate the progress of normalization of portal blood flow, and detect the reduced perfusion caused by endotoxin. It is recognized that portal vein blood flow is normalized as the function of the graft liver is restored. A high portal pressure is strongly associated with poor liver transplantation outcomes. A high portal venous pressure reportedly increases gut-related bacteremia in living donor patients with liver transplantations and increases blood endotoxin levels. Several mechanisms such as a vulnerable intestinal barrier, changes in the intestinal microbiota, and decreased endotoxin clearance in the liver were reported. Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury negatively affects allograft function following liver transplantation. Although many different involved cell types (sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, neutrophils, and platelets) and mechanisms (toll-like receptor signaling, micro-RNA expression, production of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and activation of hypoxia-inducible factors) were reported so far, it is uncertain whether Q-CRT can detect hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. It should be noted that many pathological mechanisms, other than ischemia reperfusion injury, are deemed to contribute to poor outcomes for liver transplantation.

### Angiography and embolisation for solid abdominal organ injury in adults-a current perspective [^50a31458]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trauma is a leading cause of death and over 5 million people per year die from their injuries. Patients often have abdominal injuries which require prompt assessment and triage. A recent study of over 1000 patients following abdominal trauma identified over 300 injuries on abdominal CT and a study of 224 patients following abdominal trauma whom received CT regardless of haemodynamic stability identified 35 splenic injuries, 24 hepatic injuries and 13 renal injuries.

Emergency laparotomy is the standard treatment for patients with abdominal injury and haemodynamic instability. Over the past twenty years there has been a shift towards non-operative management (NOM) for haemodynamically stable patients without evidence of hollow viscus injury and, more recently for selected unstable patients. The availability of rapid CT and the development and refinement of embolisation techniques has widened the indications for NOM in the management of trauma.

Optimal trauma management requires a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons and interventional radiologists, coupled with modern facilities and equipment. The emerging standard for trauma centres is the provision of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) within the emergency department allowing rapid and complete CT diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes including reduction in ICU and hospital bed stays. In addition there should be adequate provision of interventional radiology expertise - in practice this is not always the case.

Rapid assessment and treatment is vital in the management of patients with significant abdominal injury. Multiple bleeding sites or severe haemodynamic instability remain indications for surgery, and ATLS guidelines for the management of haemodynamically unstable patients advocate surgery without CT. Patients who are stable or rapidly become stable with fluid resuscitation are suitable for CT, which will allow appropriate treatment decisions to be made. Traditionally a lot of time is spent on plain films but all of this information and more will be obtained by a CT. Embolisation aims to achieve haemostasis and salvage organs without the need for surgery, reducing the resuscitation period and transfusion requirements. Super-selective embolisation is performed whenever possible.

This review gives a current perspective on the role of embolisation in adults with vascular complications arising from blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma, and includes illustrative examples from our practice and technical advice on 'how to do it'.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^84460e13]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Vasopressors and MAP targets indicates that vasopressors may be required for critically ill patients with shock to maintain end-organ perfusion while concurrent fluid resuscitation is ongoing. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of 65 mm Hg is typical in critically ill patients, but there are no RCTs confirming this approach in cirrhosis or ACLF; in 273 critically ill patients with cirrhosis, ICU mortality increased below 65 mm Hg and maintaining a MAP of ≥ 65 mm Hg was suggested as an early goal, whereas in a general critical care vasodilatory shock RCT (n = 2600), permissive hypotension with MAP target 60–65 mm Hg showed no difference in 90-day mortality (41.0% vs. 43.8%; adjusted OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.98). The optimal approach is to use an individualized MAP target with frequent end-organ perfusion assessment; Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines suggest invasive arterial monitoring as soon as practical and suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to reach the MAP target than delaying until central venous access is secured. Norepinephrine (0.01–0.05 μg/kg/min) is recommended as the first-line vasopressor agent to maintain adequate organ perfusion pressure in patients with septic shock.

### Open abdomen critical care management principles: resuscitation, fluid balance, nutrition, and ventilator management [^c4523e13]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Damage control surgery

In trauma, DCS refers to performing an initial laparotomy in the hemodynamically unstable patient with the goal of quickly temporizing life-threatening injuries. It originated with therapeutic packing to manage hemorrhage from liver injuries in the early 1900s and has evolved to the technique used today. Once hemorrhage and spillage of enteric contents have been controlled, the patient is assessed for acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. If elements of this lethal triad are present, the patient may be left with an OA and resuscitated in an intensive care unit (ICU) until they are medically able to tolerate a more lengthy operative procedure for definitive repair of injuries and abdominal closure. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) practice management committee performed a literature review of the management of the OA in trauma and emergency general surgery in 2010. According to their published guidelines, level III evidence exists to support the use of the OA technique in a trauma setting in the presence of acidosis (pH < 7.2), hypothermia (temperature < 35°C), and clinical coagulopathy with transfusion of > 10 units of red blood cells (RBCs).

### Decreased mortality, laparotomy, and embolization rates for liver injuries during a 13-year period in a major scandinavian trauma center [^111eeba1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of liver injuries in adults has changed substantially during the last 50 years. In the 1980s the aggressive operative approach was challenged by a non-operative management (NOM) strategy associated with improved patient outcomes. The current treatment of blunt liver injuries is based on physiology with NOM as the standard in hemodynamically normal(ized) patients irrespective of injury grade. However, it is well recognized that a significant number of patients with severe liver injuries (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Scale (OIS) grades 4 and 5)still require emergency surgery, and most reported overall mortality rates for these patients exceed 50%. The majority of these patients have multiple injuries, are physiologically compromised, and undergo aggressive fluid resuscitation. The contemporary initial resuscitation strategy of severely injured patients termed damage control resuscitation (DCR) includes early balanced use of blood products and restrictive use of crystalloids.DCR has been associated with reduced mortality and complication rates in the trauma population. It is important to underline that any comparison between published studies remains challenging due to lack of consistency with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

In line with international trends, our initial treatment of severely injured patients has changed during the last 15 years, including improved multidisciplinary approach, updated protocols for interventional radiology, and DCR. We have previously shown that DCR was associated with improved outcome in patients with severe pelvic injuries, including reduced need for operative interventions and angioembolization (AE).

The aim of the present study was to describe the treatment and outcomes in patients with liver injuries during a 13-year period. Based on the changes in treatment strategies during the study period, a further exploration of high-grade injuries, the need for and type of operative intervention, as well as the use of AE was performed.

### Managing malaria in the intensive care unit [^9fa1b7cc]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluids and cardiac function

The traditional adage is that patients with severe malaria should be managed with relatively restricted fluid volumes because of concerns about the risk of capillary leak and lung and cerebral oedema. This practice is supported by the movement in critical care to a more fluid restrictive practice in patients with acute lung injury (ALI). However, this restrictive fluid regimen commences only after initial resuscitation has been completed. No large trials have assessed fluid resuscitation strategies in patients with severe malaria in a developed world ICU setting; current data are derived only from trials in endemic areas and from small physiological studies.

The fluid expansion as supportive therapy study randomized 3141 African children presenting with severe febrile illness to maintenance fluids with or without boluses of either crystalloid (0.9% saline) or colloid (5% human albumin solution). Malaria was the reason for admission in 57% of these children. The trial was stopped early because of a significant increase in mortality in both groups who received fluid boluses compared with the group receiving maintenance fluids only (4 week mortality 8.7% vs 12.0% and 12.2%, P = 0.004 for comparison of maintenance with bolus). In a post hoc analysis, there was an increase in terminal cardiovascular events related to fluid resuscitation. There were no differences in mortality between the sub-groups of children with malarial and bacterial infections. There are obvious limitations in applying these findings to critical care settings in the developed world as the children could not be offered mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, nor inotropic support. Furthermore, time to hospital presentation, while not formally measured, was likely to be significantly longer than in a developed world setting, so the potential risk of an exaggerated reperfusion injury after aggressive resuscitation cannot be discounted.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^11d12641]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — hemodynamics and renal failure note that the hemodynamic profile resembles septic shock with a hyperdynamic circulation (high cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance, and decreased effective circulating volume). Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation is the primary intervention to maintain adequate tissue perfusion; to avoid volume overload and potential increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), pulse pressure variation measures are proposed to assess fluid responsiveness and guide vasopressor need, but this requires local expertise and further validation is needed to recommend its use. When IV fluid administration is ineffective, vasopressor use is the next reasonable step to maintain a satisfactory mean arterial pressure (MAP).

### Causes of death after fluid bolus resuscitation: new insights from FEAST [^85701abd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

An additional mechanism of increased cardiovascular causes of death may relate to treatment-induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. When infused rapidly and in large volumes, albumin in saline carrier solutions may have the same effect on chloride and acid-base status as saline. This effect is not seen when other crystalloid solutions with more physiological strong ion differences are infused.

The role of acidosis-induced cardiotoxicity remains uncertain, but this effect, in conjunction with a potential ischemia-reperfusion injury, may have been amplified in this patient population where close monitoring of acid-base status or support with mechanical ventilation or vasopressors was not possible.

However, this does not exclude the possibility that rapid high volume fluid resuscitation may be harmful under conditions with more resources. Trials of fluid resuscitation with colloids (albumin and hydroxyethyl starch) in high-income countries have also demonstrated transient improvements in indices of hemodynamic resuscitation, but these have not been associated with improvements in mortality or other patient-centered outcomes.

Furthermore, it appears that, as adjudicated by the TCEs, fluid overload was not a predominant cause of excess deaths in the patients in the FEAST study. This is of interest, particularly the low incidence of neurological causes of death. Although administration of albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury, this was not evident in this patient population, even though a substantial proportion of patients had severe cerebral malaria.

Although it appears that bolus resuscitation with albumin and saline in critically ill children in resource-poor conditions cannot be recommended, further high-quality studies examining the effects of balanced salt solutions for fluid resuscitation are required in this patient population. Indeed, the question of the optimal resuscitation fluid, both the type and dose, remains uncertain in all critically ill patient population across all income regions.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^c2cb404b]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fluid balance in sepsis and septic shock — restrictive versus liberal strategies after initial resuscitation: Recommendation 45 states "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation", with the remark that "Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion". The rationale notes that "The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours", with Rivers administering "over 13 L of fluids" and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe "approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups"; recent evidence "suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction", and observational and African data have shown an "association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality", though generalizability is limited by comorbidities and resource constraints.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation-associated major liver injury [^b697a971]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the frequency, presentation, treatment and outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation-associated major liver injury in patients after non-traumatic in- or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective analysis of a cardiac arrest registry in a tertiary care hospital emergency department. We reviewed patients charts, laboratory data, diagnostic imaging studies and autoptic findings.

Results

Within 14.5 years, major liver injury (rupture/laceration, haemorrhage/haematoma) was found in 15 of 2558 cardiac arrest victims (0.6%). Eleven were male (73%), median age was 58 (IQR 53–67). In seven, resuscitation was started out-of-hospital. In 9 of the 15 patients, liver injury was correctly diagnosed intra vitam. In 5, haematocrit level was low on admission, in 8 haematocrit dropped significantly during observation; haemostasis was compromised in 13 patients, 4 of them receiving thrombolytic therapy. Bedside abdominal sonography showed free intra-peritoneal fluid in 8 of 9 cases examined. In 11 patients, we found liver rupture/laceration, in 4 liver haemorrhage/haematoma. The site of injury was the left liver lobe in 11, six underwent emergent surgery. Two of 15 patients survived to 6 months in good neurological condition, 1 after emergency surgery. No patient died from bleeding due to liver injury.

Conclusion

Our single centre observation confirms that resuscitation-associated major liver injury is infrequent and shows that most patients had compromised haemostasis. Low or dropping haematocrit should trigger suspicion. Bedside sonography reveals intra-peritoneal fluid or liver injury. A conservative therapeutic approach or emergency surgery may be warranted. Major liver injury alone scarcely appears to influence overall outcome.

### A pilot study on early versus delayed hypertonic saline dextran resuscitation in a porcine model of near-lethal liver injury: early hemodynamic response and short-term survival [^e44e426a]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We studied the effects of early versus delayed fluid resuscitation on hemodynamic response and short-term survival in a porcine model of severe hepatic injury associated with hemorrhagic shock.

Materials and Methods

Eighteen anesthetized swine were randomized after standardized liver injury into two groups: early resuscitation (ER, n = 9) and delayed resuscitation (DR, n = 9). The ER and DR groups were resuscitated with hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) 20 min and 40 min after the injury, respectively. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and arterial blood gases were measured in addition to vascular blood flow rates in the aorta, hepatic artery and portal vein. The duration of follow-up was 100 min.

Results

MAP decreased from 112 ± 4 to 23 ± 2 mmHg (P < 0.05) during 20 min after the injury. Bolus infusion of HSD significantly elevated MAP, CO, and flow rates in the aorta, portal vein and common hepatic artery in both groups. Portal vein flow remained relatively high during the shock. Intra-abdominal bleeding (ER, 701 ± 42 mL; DR 757 ± 78 mL) and the mortality rate (ER 44%; DR 33%) did not differ between the groups 100 min after injury (P > 0.05). Aortic flow, portal vein flow, common hepatic artery flow, MAP, CO, PaO₂, PaCO₂, base deficit, pH, hemoglobin measurements, and the volume of blood shed into the intraperitoneal cavity did not affect survival in the Cox regression analysis.

Conclusions

Early versus delayed fluid infusion with HSD resulted in a comparable hemodynamic response and survival 100 min after injury. No rebleeding was observed.

### Acute kidney injury during liver transplantation as determined by neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [^66058937]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has significant prognostic implications for long-term outcomes in patients undergoing liver transplantation. In several retrospective studies, perioperative variables have been associated with AKI. These variables have been mainly associated with changes in creatinine concentrations over several days or months post-transplantation. To better define AKI, new markers have become available that help to identify patients at risk for renal injury within hours of a triggering insult. We prospectively enrolled liver transplant patients at our institutions to evaluate neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a marker of early renal injury, as a surrogate for AKI in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Blood was prospectively collected at predetermined time points from 59 patients at 2 institutions. The electronic anesthesia records and the hospital computer data system were reviewed for perioperative variables. Data collection included patient demographics, intraoperative variables such as fluid management, transfusion requirements, hemodynamics, and urine output. Subsequently, patients were grouped according to the presence of risk for developing AKI as defined by the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage kidney disease) criteria. The difference between the NGAL concentration 2 hours after reperfusion and the baseline NGAL concentration was predictive of AKI in all patients, including patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. In patients with creatinine concentrations less than 1.5 mg/dL, a single NGAL determination 2 hours after reperfusion of the liver was associated with the development of AKI. Total occlusion of the inferior vena cava was associated with AKI. In conclusion, NGAL concentrations obtained during surgery were highly associated with postoperative AKI in patients undergoing liver transplantation. These findings will allow the design of larger interventional studies. Our findings regarding the impact of surgical techniques and glucose require validation in larger studies.

### Vasopressin improves survival in a porcine model of abdominal vascular injury [^7a6d3664]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

For haemodynamic stabilization of critically injured patients with uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock, current advanced trauma life support guidelines recommend infusion of crystalloid or colloid solutions. Interestingly, there appears to be no evidence either for or against early or large amounts of intravenous fluid administration in uncontrolled haemorrhage. Although these findings on fluids in uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock are inconclusive, the strategy of delaying fluid resuscitation must be deemed unconfirmed as well, because the only study to examine the efficacy of this approach yielded barely significant findings.

One way to promote vasoconstriction may be to inject vasopressin, which has potent vasoconstrictive effects, even in severe acidosis and developed vasoplegia. In porcine models of uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock after liver trauma, vasopressin was superior to fluid resuscitation, adrenaline (epinephrine), and saline placebo in terms of blood loss, haemodynamic variables, and survival. In agreement with these experiments, vasopressin reduced blood loss and stabilized arterial blood pressure in patients who had suffered traumatic or nontraumatic injury with haemorrhagic shock that was refractory to catecholamines. Although beneficial effects of vasopressin may seem realistic in a parenchymatic organ such as the liver, pronounced vascular injury may impose limitations with regard to vasoconstriction-mediated reductions in blood loss. This may be important because patients suffering multiple trauma often sustain complex injuries, with bleeding from multiple sources. A clinical trial comparing vasopressin against placebo as an adjunct to standard shock treatment in unstable multiple trauma patients is currently in preparation, but further information about underlying mechanisms is needed.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of vasopressin with those of fluid resuscitation and saline placebo on haemodynamic variables and short-term survival in an abdominal vascular injury model of uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no differences in study end-points.

### Hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury from bench to bedside [^39a66e31]. The British Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vascular occlusion to prevent haemorrhage during liver resection causes ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Insights into the mechanisms of IR injury gathered from experimental models have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches, some of which have already been tested in randomized clinical trials.

Methods

The review was based on a PubMed search using the terms 'ischemia AND hepatectomy', 'ischemia AND liver', 'hepatectomy AND drug treatment', 'liver AND intermittent clamping' and 'liver AND ischemic preconditioning'; only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.

Results

Twelve RCTs reported on ischaemic preconditioning and intermittent clamping. Both strategies seem to confer protection and allow extension of ischaemia time. Fourteen RCTs evaluating pharmacological interventions, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, vasodilators, pharmacological preconditioning and glucose infusion, were identified.

Conclusion

Several strategies to prevent hepatic IR have been developed, but few have been incorporated into clinical practice. Although some pharmacological strategies showed promising results with improved clinical outcome there is not sufficient evidence to recommend them.

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^70fcfd3d]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal Replacement Therapy

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a temporary option to potentially bridge the limited number of eligible LT candidates with HRS‐AKI to transplantation. Associated risks and poor outcomes, however, make RRT a suboptimal solution for such patients. RRT in patients who are critically ill is complicated by high morbidity and mortality rates. Survival with RRT in patients with end‐stage liver disease presenting with HRS‐AKI is short, and the overall benefit is not well documented. In LT candidates, a 59% mortality rate in patients requiring > 7 days of in‐hospital continuous RRT has been observed.

Patients with RRT are also at risk for general acute complications, such as intradialytic hypotension, increased risk of cardiac events, and complications related to venous access (including bleeding and infections). Patients with decompensated cirrhosis present additional physiologic challenges that impair adequate volume management during RRT. Portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilation result in decreased effective circulating volume and low mean arterial pressure; both impact volume management. Continuous RRT involves intensive care unit (ICU) care, immobilization, anticoagulation, and subsequent bleeding risks. Intermittent RRT is complicated by hemodynamic instability attributed to rapid fluid and solute shifts, resulting in intradialytic hypotension and cerebral edema.

Although HRS‐AKI is thought to be reversible with LT, post‐LT renal function may be adversely affected. Data indicate that the longer patients are maintained on RRT while awaiting transplantation, the higher the risk of nonrecovery of renal function after LT. In 1041 LT recipients on RRT at the time of transplantation, 707 recipients (67.9%) had spontaneous recovery of renal function after LT. Patients who recovered spontaneously had a significantly shorter course of RRT in the pretransplant time period (15.6 versus 36.6 days; P < 0.001). Recovery of renal function was observed in 70.8% and 11.5% of recipients on RRT for < 30 days and > 90 days, respectively. In another study, 2112 adult transplantation recipients who received acute RRT for ≤ 90 days before LT were assessed. The adjusted renal nonrecovery risk increased by 3.6% per day of pretransplantation RRT (P < 0.001). According to the United Network for Organ Sharing criteria, if patients require dialysis for ≥ 6 weeks before LT, they are candidates for simultaneous kidney/LT because of this risk of renal nonrecovery.

### Effect of plasma resuscitation with adjunctive peritoneal resuscitation on hepatic blood flow and end-organ damage after hemorrhagic shock [^16b14e6f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intestinal injury from resuscitated hemorrhagic shock (HS) disrupts intestinal microvascular flow and causes enterocyte apoptosis, intestinal barrier breakdown, and injury to multiple organs. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) resuscitation or directed peritoneal (DPR) resuscitation protect endothelial glycocalyx, improve intestinal blood flow, and alleviate intestinal injury. We postulated that FFP plus DPR might improve effective hepatic blood flow (EHBF) and prevent associated organ injury (liver, heart).

Study Design

Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent HS (40% mean arterial pressure, 60 minutes) and were randomly assigned to groups (n = 8 per group): Sham; crystalloid resuscitation (CR; shed blood + 2 volumes CR); DPR (intraperitoneal 2.5% peritoneal dialysis fluid); FFP (shed blood + 1vol IV FFP); FFP + DPR. EHBF was measured at postresuscitation timepoints. Organ injury was evaluated by serum ELISA (fatty acid-binding protein [FABP]-1 [liver], FABP-3 [heart], Troponin-I [heart], and Troponin-C [heart]) and hematoxylin and eosin. Differences were evaluated by 1-way ANOVA and 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA.

Results

CR resuscitation alone did not sustain EHBF. FFP resuscitation restored EHBF after resuscitation (2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours). DPR resuscitation restored EHBF throughout the postresuscitation period but failed to restore serum FABP-1 VS other groups. Combination FFP + DPR rapidly and sustainably restored EHBF and decreased organ injury. CR and DPR alone had elevated organ injury (FABP-1 [hepatocyte], FABP-3 [cardiac], and Troponin-I/C), whereas FFP or FFP + DPR demonstrated reduced injury at 4 hours after resuscitation.

Conclusion

HS decreased EHBF, hepatocyte injury, and cardiac injury as evidenced by serology. FFP resuscitation improved EHBF and decreased organ damage. Although DPR resuscitation resulted in sustained EHBF, this alone failed to decrease hepatocyte or cardiac injury. Combination therapy with DPR and FFP may be a novel method to improve intestinal and hepatic blood flow and decrease organ injury after HS/resuscitation.

### Flutamide fails to reduce resuscitation requirements in a porcine ischemia-reperfusion model [^69208df2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hemorrhagic shock and subsequent resuscitation can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury, followed by multiorgan failure and death. Flutamide, a vasoactive nonsteroidal antiandrogen compound, is thought to improve tissue and organ perfusion. We tested whether administration of flutamide-cyclodextrin (FLU-CYD) alters physiologic parameters or resuscitation requirements in a porcine model of severe acidosis and shock secondary to combined hemorrhage + ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Methods and Materials

Fifteen male pigs underwent a 35% blood-volume hemorrhage. Ischemia was induced by cross-clamping the supraceliac aorta for 50 min followed by reperfusion and resuscitation. FLU-CYD complex was administered during aortic clamping. Fluid resuscitation and epinephrine were titrated by protocol to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 40 mm Hg for 6 h. Sequential laboratory results were obtained and serum levels of FLU and 2-hydroxy-flutamide (FLUOH) were measured by mass spectrometry.

Results

Mean requirements for injured control swine were 14.6 (± 1.21 standard error of the mean [SEM]) L crystalloid saline and 0.59 (± 0.29 SEM) g epinephrine, compared with 16.30 (± 1.33 SEM) L and 0.54 (± 0.16 SEM) g, respectively, in the FLU-CYD group (both P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in central hemodynamics between control and experimental groups. No significant differences for pH, bicarbonate, fibrinogen, or international normalized ratio were evident. FLU-CYD resuscitation was associated with a significant increase in lactate levels compared with controls (10.1 versus 5.7 mmol/L, P < 0.05). Histologic injury was significantly increased in the livers of FLU-CYD compared with sham (P = 0.022). High serum levels of FLU and the active metabolite FLUOH were measurable throughout the resuscitation period.

Conclusions

Flutamide failed to show any benefit to resuscitation in a model of severe injury and was associated with increased acidosis, hemodilution, and liver injury compared with standard crystalloid resuscitation.

### Liver graft preconditioning, preservation and reconditioning [^925e9d5d]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation is the successful treatment of end-stage liver disease; however, the ischaemia-reperfusion injury still jeopardizes early and long-term post-transplant outcomes. In fact, ischaemia-reperfusion is associated with increased morbidity and graft dysfunction, especially when suboptimal donors are utilized. Strategies to reduce the severity of ischaemia-reperfusion can be applied at different steps of the transplantation process: organ procurement, preservation phase or before revascularization. During the donor procedure, preconditioning consists of pre-treating the graft prior to a sustained ischaemia either by a transient period of ischaemia-reperfusion or administration of anti-ischaemic medication, although a multi-pharmacological approach seems more promising. Different preservation solutions were developed to maintain graft viability during static cold storage, achieving substantial results in terms of liver function and survival in good quality organs but not in suboptimal ones. Indeed, preservation solutions do not prevent dysfunction of poor quality organs and are burdened with inadequate preservation of the biliary epithelium. Advantages derived from either hypo- or normothermic machine perfusion are currently investigated in experimental and clinical settings, suggesting a reconditioning effect possibly improving hepatocyte and biliary preservation and resuscitating graft function prior to transplantation. In this review, we highlight acquired knowledge and recent advances in liver graft preconditioning, preservation and reconditioning.

### Resuscitation strategies with different arterial pressure targets after surgical management of traumatic shock [^a0e97a23]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Furthermore, high MAP resuscitation also resulted in a worse outcome than middle MAP resuscitation. The high MAP resuscitation group required a much larger late resuscitation volume than the other groups, and the need for increased crystalloid solution resulted in severe tissue oedema and further haemodilution in this group. The changes in the ELWI and histopathology of the lungs and ileum confirmed severe tissue oedema; this resulted in a sustained decline of PaO₂ 10 hours after the onset of late resuscitation. The changes in PaO 2 combined with further haemodilution caused the CaO 2 to reach a nadir in the high MAP group during late resuscitation. Thus, despite the lack of a significant difference in the CI between the high and middle MAP groups, the DO₂ in the high MAP group was significantly lower than that in the middle MAP group during late resuscitation. Moreover, the high MAP group exhibited a gradual decrease in the ABE and increases in the lactate levels and O 2 ER 14 hours after the onset of late resuscitation. The histopathologic changes in the lungs and severely increased ELWI, combined with decreased PaO₂, are likely the pathophysiologic causes of respiratory failure in this group. The moderately increased AST and ALT levels and changes in the BUN and creatinine levels, together with the histopathologic injuries in the liver, kidneys, and ileum, suggest tissue microcirculation dysfunction, tissue oedema, and oxygen insufficiency. These results are consistent with those in study of Holcroft et al. who found excessive fluid administration could result in fulminant pulmonary oedema, steeply increased ELWI, and decreased PaO 2, both in healthy animals and in animals with haemorrhagic shock. Sturm et al. demonstrated that severe multiple trauma could induce an early increase in pulmonary capillary permeability, and this would increase the risk of excessive fluid administration.

### Early and sustained vasopressin infusion augments the hemodynamic efficacy of restrictive fluid resuscitation and improves survival in a liver laceration model of hemorrhagic shock [^b1e2055a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current management of hemorrhagic shock favors restrictive fluid resuscitation before control of the bleeding source. We investigated the additional effects of early and sustained vasopressin infusion in a swine model of hemorrhagic shock produced by liver laceration.

Methods

Forty male domestic pigs (32–40 kg) had a liver laceration inflicted with an X-shaped blade clamp, 32 received a second laceration at minute 7.5, and 24 received two additional lacerations at minute 15. Using a two-by-two factorial design, animals were randomized 1:1 to receive vasopressin infusion (0.04 U/kg per minute) or vehicle intraosseously from minute 7 until minute 240 and 1:1 to receive isotonic sodium chloride solution (12 mL/kg) intravenously at minute 30 or no fluids.

Results

Kaplan-Meier curves showed greater survival after vasopressin with isotonic sodium chloride solution (8/10) compared to vasopressin without isotonic sodium chloride solution (4/10), vehicle with isotonic sodium chloride solution (3/10), or vehicle without isotonic sodium chloride solution (3/10), but the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.095 by log-rank test). However, logistic regression showed vasopressin to elicit a statistically significant benefit on survival (p = 0.042). Vasopressin augmented mean aortic pressure between 10 and 20 mm Hg without intensifying the rate of bleeding from liver laceration, which was virtually identical to that of vehicle-treated animals (33.9 ± 5.1 and 33.8 ± 4.8 mL/kg). Vasopressin increased systemic vascular resistance and reduced transcapillary fluid extravasation, augmenting the volume of isotonic sodium chloride solution retained (6.5 ± 2.7 vs 2.4 ± 2.0 mL/kg by minute 60). The cardiac output and blood flow to the myocardium, liver, spleen, kidney, small bowel, and skeletal muscle at minute 120 and minute 180 were comparable or higher in the vasopressin group.

Conclusions

Early and sustained vasopressin infusion provided critical hemodynamic stability during hemorrhagic shock induced by liver laceration and increased the hemodynamic efficacy of restrictive fluid resuscitation without intensifying bleeding or compromising organ blood flow resulting in improved 240-minute survival.
