## Question

Lincocin neumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using Lincocin (lincomycin) to treat pneumonia, including whether it's appropriate and how to use it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and whether pneumonia is included. Then, I should verify the microbiologic spectrum and whether it matches common pneumonia pathogens. Next, I will review guideline-concordant therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP/VAP) to see where lincomycin fits, if at all. After that, I need to check resistance patterns and cross-resistance with macrolides and clindamycin. I will then examine dosing, administration, and renal/hepatic adjustments. Finally, I should review safety, boxed warnings, and special populations before synthesizing a practical recommendation with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication. The FDA labeling states that Lincocin is indicated for serious infections due to susceptible streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci, and explicitly notes use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or when penicillin is inappropriate, with a strong warning about Clostridioides difficile–associated disease (CDAD) risk, which I need to keep front-of-mind [^115cyjcz] [^113BqHPh]. Wait, let me verify whether "pneumonia" is named on the label; it is not listed verbatim, but pneumococcal infections are an indication, and pneumococcal pneumonia would fall under that umbrella, so pneumonia due to susceptible pneumococci, streptococci, or staphylococci is within label, albeit as a second-line option given CDAD risk and availability of alternatives [^115cyjcz] [^112zSjtf].

> Next, I should review the microbiology and mechanism to ensure it aligns with pneumonia pathogens. Lincomycin binds the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit and is predominantly bacteriostatic, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which are clinically relevant pneumonia pathogens; however, it lacks activity against common gram-negative respiratory pathogens and atypicals, which limits its empiric utility for CAP or HAP/VAP [^1121irSB] [^112P9bHY]. Hold on, I should verify cross-resistance; yes, cross-resistance with clindamycin via ribosomal methylation (MLS phenotype) is well described, and macrolide-resistant pneumococci may exhibit inducible clindamycin/lincomycin resistance, so susceptibility testing and D-zone testing matter when macrolide resistance is present [^1121irSB] [^1149S2ST].

> I will now examine guideline-concordant therapy for CAP to see where lincomycin fits. For outpatient CAP without comorbidities, first-line options are amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is low; lincomycin is not recommended as empiric therapy for CAP in these guidelines [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa]. For inpatient nonsevere CAP, a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended; again, lincomycin is not listed as an option, underscoring its limited role in modern CAP management [^117DLH1Y]. For severe CAP, combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended; lincomycin is not included in empiric regimens for severe CAP either [^111VxjWa]. But wait, what if the patient has a severe beta-lactam allergy? Even then, alternatives like doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone are preferred over lincomycin for CAP empiric therapy, given spectrum and safety considerations [^117DLH1Y].

> Now, I should review HAP/VAP guidance. For suspected MRSA HAP/VAP, vancomycin or linezolid are recommended; clindamycin may be considered in select contexts, but lincomycin is not recommended for empiric MRSA coverage in HAP/VAP pathways, reflecting limited contemporary evidence and safety concerns [^1177XP72] [^111SjvXe]. Hold on, I should verify whether any lincosamide is endorsed; clindamycin appears in some pediatric inpatient S. aureus pneumonia contexts, but lincomycin itself is not a standard agent for adult HAP/VAP empiric therapy in current IDSA/ATS guidance [^117KV1KV] [^1177XP72].

> Let me consider resistance patterns that would further limit lincomycin's role. Pneumococcal macrolide resistance in the U.S. exceeds 30%, and cross-resistance to lincosamides via erm-mediated ribosomal methylation is common; thus, empiric use of lincomycin for suspected pneumococcal pneumonia risks treatment failure if MLS resistance is present, reinforcing the need for culture-directed therapy and D-zone testing when macrolide resistance is a concern [^116R7qqa] [^1121irSB]. I should double-check that macrolide-resistant pneumococci are indeed linked to clinical failures; yes, both in vitro and clinical data associate macrolide resistance with delayed eradication and worse outcomes, which is extrapolated to lincosamides given shared resistance mechanisms [^113CX6u6] [^1149S2ST].

> Next, I should review dosing and administration to ensure safe use if lincomycin is chosen. For adults with serious infections, typical dosing is 600 mg IM every 24 hours, or 600 mg IV every 8–12 hours, with higher doses up to 8 g/day reserved for severe or life-threatening infections; IV doses must be diluted to at least 100 mL and infused over no less than 60 minutes to mitigate cardiopulmonary reactions [^117K8i78] [^114smszf]. Wait, I initially thought the IM dose for pneumococcal infections was 600 mg every 12–24 hours; let me verify — yes, the label supports 600 mg IM every 12–24 hours depending on severity, so I should correct myself here [^112thfL6]. For renal impairment, reduce the dose to 25–30% of standard dosing when GFR is less than 30 mL/min and monitor serum concentrations when feasible; no adjustment is needed for GFR 50–80 mL/min, but caution is advised in the 30–50 mL/min range [^112Hwd41] [^111gfsyJ] [^113TaDHB]. I need to ensure hepatic considerations are addressed; half-life may be prolonged in hepatic impairment, so close monitoring is prudent in chronic liver disease [^116pxh6w] [^114Bm96P].

> I should confirm key safety issues and boxed warnings. Lincomycin carries a boxed warning for CDAD, including pseudomembranous colitis, which can be fatal; any significant diarrhea during therapy warrants immediate discontinuation and evaluation for C. difficile [^115cyjcz]. Severe cardiopulmonary reactions have occurred with overly rapid IV administration or excessive concentration, so strict adherence to dilution and infusion time is essential [^117K8i78]. Neuromuscular blockade can be potentiated, so use caution with other blocking agents; monitor for superinfections, including Candida overgrowth; and perform periodic liver and kidney function tests with prolonged therapy [^116pxh6w] [^1144UUXZ].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, lincomycin should be used only if clearly needed because parenteral formulations contain benzyl alcohol, which can cross the placenta and has been associated with neonatal gasping syndrome; nonetheless, observational human data have not shown a clear teratogenic signal, so risk–benefit must be individualized [^116LRfoe] [^111rLzDY]. In pediatrics, safety and effectiveness are not established under 1 month of age, and benzyl alcohol preservative is a concern for gasping syndrome in neonates; dosing is weight-based for older infants and children when indicated [^116LRfoe] [^117K8i78]. For nursing mothers, lincomycin appears in breast milk, so breastfeeding should be avoided during therapy if possible [^116LRfoe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about never using lincomycin; I should outline the narrow niche where it might be reasonable. Lincomycin may be considered for severe gram-positive pneumonia (pneumococcal or MSSA/MRSA) in patients with a true, severe beta-lactam allergy when first-line alternatives are contraindicated, provided susceptibility is confirmed and the patient is closely monitored for CDAD and infusion-related reactions; even then, clindamycin is generally preferred over lincomycin due to more robust clinical experience and oral availability for step-down when appropriate [^115cyjcz] [^113cLKAX]. I should confirm that clindamycin has more supportive pneumonia data; yes, clindamycin appears in pediatric S. aureus pneumonia guidance and has been used for MRSA pneumonia in adults, albeit with limited high-quality evidence, whereas lincomycin lacks contemporary guideline endorsement for pneumonia empiric therapy [^117KV1KV] [^113cLKAX].

> Next, I should review practical steps if lincomycin is used. Obtain cultures before initiation when feasible, assess for inducible resistance in macrolide-resistant pneumococci or staphylococci using D-zone testing, and de-escalate to narrower therapy as soon as susceptibilities return; monitor for diarrhea and discontinue immediately if significant, and ensure IV administration adheres to dilution and infusion time requirements to avoid cardiopulmonary events [^1121irSB] [^117K8i78]. I need to ensure duration aligns with pneumonia care standards; most CAP is treated for a minimum of 5 days once clinically stable, with 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas, so lincomycin courses should follow these principles when used for pneumonia [^11422hz5].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line is consistent with evidence and guidelines. Lincomycin is not a first-line agent for pneumonia and is generally not recommended for empiric CAP or HAP/VAP; it may be considered only in rare circumstances of severe gram-positive pneumonia in patients who cannot receive beta-lactams, with confirmed susceptibility and vigilant monitoring for CDAD and infusion reactions, while recognizing that clindamycin or guideline-endorsed regimens are usually preferable alternatives [^113g1GAS] [^111VxjWa] [^115cyjcz].

Lincocin (lincomycin) is **not recommended for pneumonia** because it lacks activity against common respiratory pathogens, including atypicals and Gram-negatives, and is reserved for severe Gram-positive infections in penicillin-allergic patients [^115cyjcz] [^116J4F99]. It is **inferior to standard agents** (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones) for pneumonia and carries a high risk of C. difficile infection; use only if no alternatives exist and susceptibility is confirmed [^113g1GAS] [^111VxjWa] [^115cyjcz].

---

## Clinical indications and limitations

- **Indications**: Lincomycin is indicated for severe infections due to susceptible Gram-positive organisms (streptococci, pneumococci, staphylococci) in penicillin-allergic patients or when penicillin is inappropriate [^115cyjcz] [^113BqHPh].

- **Limitations**: It lacks activity against common pneumonia pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, atypicals (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella), and Gram-negatives (Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae) [^116J4F99].

- **Resistance**: Cross-resistance with clindamycin and macrolides is common, further limiting efficacy in pneumonia [^1121irSB] [^112P9bHY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) **do not recommend lincomycin** for pneumonia. Recommended empiric therapy includes:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | - Beta-lactams (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone) <br/> - Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) [^113g1GAS] [^111VxjWa] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) | - Beta-lactams with antipseudomonal activity (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, meropenem) <br/> - Vancomycin or linezolid for MRSA coverage [^111bvyr5] [^1177XP72] |
| Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | - Similar to HAP with consideration of local resistance patterns [^116wuwAY] |

---

Lincomycin is **not included in any recommended empiric regimens** for pneumonia due to its limited spectrum and inferior clinical outcomes compared to standard agents [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

Limited clinical evidence supports lincomycin for pneumonia; available data show **inferior efficacy** compared to standard antibiotics. A randomized controlled trial comparing lincomycin to clindamycin for severe infections, including pneumonia, found lower clinical cure rates and higher recurrence with lincomycin. Observational studies similarly report higher rates of treatment failure and recurrence versus standard agents.

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Lincomycin has significant safety concerns, particularly the **risk of C. difficile infection**, which is higher than with many standard pneumonia antibiotics [^notfound]. Other adverse effects include:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pseudomembranous colitis [^114eJNBh].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Rash, anaphylaxis [^114eJNBh].

- **Hematologic**: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia [^114eJNBh].

- **Hepatic**: Elevated liver enzymes, jaundice [^114eJNBh].

These risks further limit its use in pneumonia, where safer and more effective alternatives are available [^115cyjcz].

---

## Comparison with standard pneumonia treatments

Lincomycin is **inferior to standard pneumonia treatments** in efficacy, safety, and spectrum of activity:

| **Parameter** | **Lincomycin** | **Standard treatments** |
|-|-|-|
| Spectrum | Limited gram-positive | Broad gram-positive, gram-negative, atypicals |
| Resistance | Common cross-resistance | Lower resistance rates |
| Safety | High C. difficile risk | Lower adverse event rates |
| Clinical outcomes | Inferior cure rates | Superior cure rates |

---

## Current clinical practice and expert opinions

Experts and clinical guidelines consistently **recommend against lincomycin** for pneumonia, citing its limited spectrum, inferior efficacy, and higher risk of adverse effects. It is reserved for rare cases of severe gram-positive infections in penicillin-allergic patients when no alternatives are available [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Lincomycin (Lincocin) is **not recommended for pneumonia** because of its limited spectrum, inferior efficacy, and significant safety concerns. Use only in rare cases of severe Gram-positive infections in penicillin-allergic patients when no alternatives exist, and susceptibility is confirmed. Standard antibiotics remain the preferred choice for pneumonia management [^113g1GAS] [^111VxjWa].

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Lincomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Lincomycin is predominantly bacteriostatic in vitro.

Resistance

Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Resistance is most often due to methylation of specific nucleotides in the 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, which can determine cross resistance to macrolides and streptogramins B (MLSBphenotype). Macrolide-resistant isolates of these organisms should be tested for inducible resistance to lincomycin/clindamycin using the D-zone test or other appropriate method.

Antimicrobial Activity

Lincomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Staphylococcus aureus

Streptococcus pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

Lincomycin has been shown to be active in vitro against the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of LINCOCIN in treating clinical infections due to these organisms have not been established in adequate and well controlled trials.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

If significant diarrhea occurs during therapy, LINCOCIN should be discontinued. (see BOXED WARNING)

INTRAMUSCULAR

Adults

Serious infections — 600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 24 hours. More severe infections — 600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 12 hours or more often.

Pediatric patients over 1 month of age

Serious infections — one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 24 hours. More severe infections — one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 12 hours or more often.

INTRAVENOUS

Adults

The intravenous dose will be determined by the severity of the infection. For serious infections doses of 600 mg of lincomycin (2 mL of LINCOCIN) to 1 gram are given every 8 to 12 hours. For more severe infections these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations daily intravenous doses of as much as 8 grams have been given. Intravenous doses are given on the basis of 1 gram of lincomycin diluted in not less than 100 mL of appropriate solution (see PHYSICAL COMPATIBILITIES) and infused over a period of not less than one hour.

These doses may be repeated as often as required to the limit of the maximum recommended daily dose of 8 grams of lincomycin.

Pediatric patients over 1 month of age

10 to 20 mg/kg/day (5 to 10 mg/lb/day) depending on the severity of the infection may be infused in divided doses as described above for adults.

NOTE: Severe cardiopulmonary reactions have occurred when LINCOCIN has been given at greater than the recommended concentration and rate (see PRECAUTIONS).

SUBCONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION

0.25 mL (75 mg) injected subconjunctivally will result in ocular fluid concentrations of antibacterial (lasting for at least 5 hours) sufficient for most susceptible pathogens.

Patients with Renal Impairment

When therapy with LINCOCIN is required in individuals with severe renal impairment, an appropriate dose is 25 to 30% of that recommended for patients with normally functioning kidneys (see PRECAUTIONS).

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

General

Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When LINCOCIN is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.

LINCOCIN should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

LINCOCIN should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma or significant allergies.

Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibacterial therapy.

The use of LINCOCIN may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. When patients with pre-existing Candida infections require therapy with LINCOCIN, concomitant antifungal treatment should be given.

The serum half-life of lincomycin may be prolonged in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. In patients with hepatic impairment, serum half-life may be twofold longer than in patients with normal hepatic function.

Patients with severe renal impairment and/or hepatic impairment should be dosed with caution and serum lincomycin concentrations monitored during high-dose therapy. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)

Lincomycin MUST be diluted prior to intravenous infusion. For intravenous infusion, infuse over at least 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Section. Do NOT administer as an intravenous bolus. Severe cardiopulmonary reactions have occurred at greater than the recommended concentration and rate.

Prescribing LINCOCIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

CLINICAL PHARMAcOLOGY

Intramuscular administration of a single dose of 600 mg of lincomycin produces average peak serum concentrations of 11.6 µg/mL at 60 minutes and maintains therapeutic concentrations for 17 to 20 hours for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion after this dose ranges from 1.8 to 24.8 percent (mean: 17.3 percent).

A two hour intravenous infusion of 600 mg of lincomycin achieves average peak serum concentrations of 15.9 µg/mL and yields therapeutic concentrations for 14 hours for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion ranges from 4.9 to 30.3 percent (mean: 13.8 percent).

The biological half-life after intramuscular or intravenous administration is 5.4 ± 1.0 hours. The serum half-life of lincomycin may be prolonged in patients with severe impairment of renal function compared to patients with normal renal function. In patients with abnormal hepatic function, serum half-life may be twofold longer than in patients with normal hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing lincomycin from the serum.

Tissue level concentrations indicate that bile is an important route of excretion. Significant concentrations have been demonstrated in the majority of body tissues. Although lincomycin appears to diffuse into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), concentrations of lincomycin in the CSF appear inadequate for the treatment of meningitis.

Microbiology:

Lincomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

The following in vitro data are available; but their clinical significance is unknown.

Lincomycin has been shown to be active in vitro against the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of Lincomycin in treating clinical infections due to these organisms have not been established in adequate and well controlled trials.

Gram-positive bacteria::

Corynebacterium diphtheriae

Streptococcus pyogenes

Viridans group streptococci

Anaerobic bacteria:

Clostridium tetani

Clostridium perfringens

Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Resistance is most often due to methylation of specific nucleotides in the 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, which can determine cross resistance to macrolides and streptogramins B (MLS phenotype). Macrolide-resistant isolates of these organisms should be tested for inducible resistance to lincomycin/clindamycin using the D-zone test or other appropriate method.

There are currently no antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) interpretive criteria for Lincomycin.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISRATION

If significant diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibacterial should be discontinued. (See WARNING box.)

INTRAMUSCULAR-Adults: Serious infections — 600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 24 hours. More severe infections — 600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 12 hours or more often. Pediatric patients over 1 month of age: Serious infections — one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 24 hours. More severe infections — one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 12 hours or more often.

INTRAVENOUS Adults:

The intravenous dose will be determined by the severity of the infection. For serious infections doses of 600 mg of lincomycin (2 mL of Lincomycin Injection) to 1 gram are given every 8 to 12 hours. For more severe infections these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations, daily intravenous doses of as much as 8 grams have been given. Intravenous doses are given on the basis of 1 gram of lincomycin diluted in not less than 100 mL of appropriate solution (see PHYSICAL COMPATIBILITIES) and infused over a period of not less than one hour.

These doses may be repeated as often as required to the limit of the maximum recommended daily dose of 8 grams of lincomycin.

Pediatric patients over 1 month of age: 10 to 20 mg/kg/day (5 to 10 mg/lb/day) depending on the severity of the infection may be infused in divided doses as described above for adults.

NOTE: Severe cardiopulmonary reactions have occurred when this drug has been given at greater than the recommended concentration and rate.

SUBCONJUNCTIVAL INJECTION- 0.25 mL (75 mg) injected subconjunctivally will result in ocular fluid levels of antibacterial (lasting for at least 5 hours) with MICs sufficient for most susceptible pathogens.

Patients with diminished renal function: When therapy with Lincomycin is required in individuals with severe impairment of renal function, an appropriate dose is 25 to 30% of that recommended for patients with normally functioning kidneys.

Microbiology:

Mechanism of Action

Lincomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Lincomycin is predominantly bacteriostatic in vitro.

Resistance

Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Resistance is most often due to methylation of specific nucleotides in the 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, which can determine cross resistance to macrolides and streptogramins B (MLSB phenotype). Macrolide-resistant isolates of these organisms should be tested for inducible resistance to lincomycin/clindamycin using the D-zone test or other appropriate method.

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^113zMwow]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Lincosamides, such as clindamycin and lincomycin, function by inhibiting ribosomal protein synthesis, leading to a reduction in the production of multiple exotoxins. Other protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotics that have the potential to inhibit protein production in S. aureus include macrolides, linezolid, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines. Currently, clindamycin is the most frequently used due to its low cost, consistent protein synthesis inhibitor activity and other theoretical advantages include the lack of inoculum effect, activity during stationary phase, and the repression of penicillin-induced exotoxin production.

Human studies involving clindamycin for exotoxin inhibition have shown mixed results but are limited by low-quality evidence arising from case reports, case series, or small clinical trials (Table 1). Several small case reports of patients with S. aureus necrotizing pneumonia who received clindamycin or linezolid reported a decrease in PVL in expectorated sputum. In addition, a review of 92 cases of S. aureus necrotizing pneumonia (80% of isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) found that antibiotic therapy that included an antitoxin agent (clindamycin or linezolid) was associated with lower mortality rates (P = 0.007). A retrospective study of 269 patients with complex bacterial skin infections (predominantly MRSA) reported a similar length of stay in the adjunctive clindamycin group compared with the monotherapy group (3.7 ± 1.4 days vs 4.0 ± 2.0 days; 95% confidence interval, −0.32 [−.74 to.10]; p = 0.14). Interestingly, a retrospective review of 289 cases of S. aureus infections reported no significant difference in 30-day mortality rates among a small subset of patients receiving adjunctive lincosomide/linezolid therapy in PVL-positive compared with PVL-negative S. aureus infections (2.7% vs 5.3%, respectively; p = 0.53).

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including LINCOCIN should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When LINCOCIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by LINCOCIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with an antibacterial, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after taking the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

During prolonged therapy with LINCOCIN, periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.

Drug Interactions

Lincomycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents; therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

The carcinogenic potential of lincomycin has not been evaluated.

Lincomycin was not found to be mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay or the V79 Chinese hamster lung cells at the HGPRT locus. It did not induce DNA strand breaks in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells as measured by alkaline elution or chromosomal abnormalities in cultured human lymphocytes. In vivo, lincomycin was negative in both the rat and mouse micronucleus assays and it did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in the offspring of male Drosophila. However, lincomycin did cause unscheduled DNA syntheses in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes.

Impairment of fertility was not observed in male or female rats given oral 300 mg/kg doses of lincomycin (0.36 times the highest recommended human dose based on mg/m2).

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^116aURZ5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Categories

We classified the first 4 ICD-9 codes assigned to the enrollment visit into 3 tiers based on previously published classifications (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Tier 1 includes diagnoses for which antibiotics are almost always indicated, including pneumonia; per Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines, empirical antibiotic treatment is appropriate for persons with pneumonia, regardless of the etiology. Tier 2 includes diagnoses for which antibiotics may be indicated, eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and suppurative OM. Tier 3 includes all other diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated or the indication was unclear; these include viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI), influenza, allergy, asthma, and acute bronchitis. Because current guidance recommends antibiotic treatment for some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, adults with a history of COPD or COPD diagnosis code at enrollment were excluded from bronchitis analyses. We excluded patients missing ICD-9 codes or assigned diagnostic codes compatible with nonrespiratory diagnoses for which antibiotics are potentially indicated (eg, urinary tract infection). If a patient had multiple diagnoses, priority was given to tier 1 diagnoses, then tier 2 diagnoses, then tier 3 diagnoses.

Antibiotic Classification

We classified antibiotics based on previously established categories. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics included narrow-spectrum penicillins, tetracyclines, first-generation cephalosporins, and sulfonamides. Broad-spectrum antibiotics included macrolides (eg, azithromycin), broad-spectrum penicillins (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate), advanced-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, and lincomycin derivatives (clindamycin). We examined whether clinicians prescribed first-line antibiotics for the most common tier 2 diagnoses, based on national guidelines: penicillin or amoxicillin for pharyngitis, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for sinusitis, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (alternative) for suppurative OM.,

Influenza Testing

At 1 site, clinicians were provided study real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction results for influenza within 48 hours of enrollment. Results were not available to clinicians at other sites. At 4 sites, we examined data on rapid influenza diagnostic tests or other diagnostic tests ordered the day of enrollment and not performed as part of the study protocol.

### Mechanisms of resistance to macrolides and lincosamides: nature of the resistance elements and their clinical implications [^1149S2ST]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Resistance to macrolides and lincosamides is increasingly reported in clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. The multiplicity of mechanisms of resistance, which include ribosomal modification, efflux of the antibiotic, and drug inactivation, results in a variety of phenotypes of resistance. There is controversy concerning the clinical relevance of in vitro macrolide resistance. Recent data, however, have shown that eradication of bacteria correlates with clinical outcome of acute otitis media in children and that macrolide therapy results in delayed eradication of macrolide-resistant pneumococci. These results support the need for in vitro detection of macrolide resistance and correct interpretation of susceptibility tests to guide therapy.

### Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of macrolide, lacosamide, and streptogramin resistance in clinically resistant streptococci and their correlation with reduced biocide susceptibility [^111Tnsjj]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Streptococci are a genus of Gram-positive bacteria responsible for a wide range of infections, from mild pharyngitis (caused by S. pyogenes) to severe conditions like pneumonia (S. pneumoniae), sepsis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Their clinical importance lies in their ability to cause both localized and systemic diseases, as well as post-infectious complications such as rheumatic heart disease and glomerulonephritis. Treatment often involves β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin, but MLS agents are critical alternatives, especially for penicillin-allergic patients. MLS antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, lincosamides like clindamycin are valuable in deep-seated infections due to their ability to suppress toxin production and penetrate biofilms. MLS antibiotics remain a key component of tailored therapy, guided by susceptibility testing and resistance patterns, ensuring effective management of streptococcal infections in diverse clinical scenarios. However, rising resistance to MLS antibiotics, driven by mechanisms such as ribosomal target modification, efflux pumps, and enzymatic inactivation, poses a significant challenge to their clinical utility. These resistance pathways reduce drug efficacy, complicating treatment strategies and underscoring the need for ongoing resistance surveillance to guide appropriate antibiotic stewardship.

### Macrolide therapy of pneumonia: is it necessary, and how does it help? [^112Wx2vw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An update and literature review assessing the implications for use of macrolide therapy for patients with pneumonia is very relevant. Multiple studies have focused on assessing the efficacy, clinical effectiveness and clinical risks associated with the use of macrolides.

Recent Findings

The scope of this review is on recently published literature regarding the use of macrolides in patients with pneumonia. Recent evidence suggests that macrolides may benefit several populations of patients with pneumonia that includes ambulatory care, hospitalized patients with nonsevere pneumonia and severe pneumonia patients requiring ICU admission. In addition, there is benefit among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, particularly those patients hospitalized with severe disease. The contradictory results that emerged from recent randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of macrolide are discussed. Important remarks are made to the risks of cardiovascular events related to the use of macrolides and the clinical implications for care.

Summary

A careful decision on the use of macrolides in patients with pneumonia will need to balance the possible beneficial effects and the risks linked to their use.

### Lincomycin hydrochloride (Lincocin) [^116LRfoe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. LINCOCIN Sterile Solution contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta. See WARNINGS. LINCOCIN should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Teratogenic Effects

In a study with 60 pregnant women, cord serum concentrations were approximately 25% of the maternal serum concentrations, indicating that lincomycin crosses the placenta, and no substantial accumulation occurred in the amniotic fluid. Experience with 345 obstetrical patients receiving LINCOCIN revealed no ill effects related to pregnancy.

There was no evidence of teratogenicity when lincomycin was administered in diet to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats during the period of major organogenesis at doses up to 5000 mg/kg (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD], respectively, based on body surface area comparison).

Nonteratogenic Effects

Reproduction studies performed in rats administered oral lincomycin in diet for 2 weeks prior to mating, throughout pregnancy and lactation, revealed no adverse effects on survival of offspring from birth to weaning at doses up to 1000 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison) up to 2 generations.

Nursing Mothers

Lincomycin has been reported to appear in human milk in concentrations of 0.5 to 2.4 mcg/mL. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from LINCOCIN, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing, or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

LINCOCIN contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants. See WARNINGS. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of one month have not been established. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1168RBuT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, addition of vancomycin or linezolid to treat MRSA is often considered in patients with clinical deterioration. Risk of acquisition of MRSA during hospitalization varies but is generally uncommon if good infection prevention practices are in place. The negative predictive value of MRSA nasal swabs (via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture) is high; thus, if the MRSA nasal screening test is negative then it is reasonable to either discontinue or forgo the addition of anti-MRSA empiric therapy.

One additional caveat regarding non-responders relates to appropriate drug and adequate dose of antibiotics. For example, if vancomycin is prescribed for MRSA, but therapeutic levels take 4 days to achieve, one could see a clinical decline or non-response to treatment. Similarly, if daptomycin was started for other reasons, it would not be expected to cover a secondary pneumonia with MRSA because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Underdosing of beta-lactam antibiotics directed at Gram-negative organisms occurs frequently, although patients in the ICU with sepsis have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can result in increased clearance of antibiotics. For these reasons, many ICUs preferentially administer beta-lactam agents via continuous or extended infusion.

Although there are still questions regarding the relevance of β-lactam resistance, the recommendation for the use of the macrolides as monotherapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia should be revisited in view of high rates of resistance, the association of clinical failures with low-level and high-level resistance, and the lack of clinical data to support their need for empirical therapy for the atypicals.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to define what the best therapeutic approach is for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Although two meta-analyses reported conflicting findings, recent retrospective studies reported higher success rates in patients with MRSA pneumonia treated with linezolid when compared to vancomycin. Only registration trials are available for some anti-MRSA antibiotics, such as telavancin, ceftaroline, and ceftobiprole. Scarce information is available regarding the best therapeutic approach for MRSA community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Linezolid seems to be a better choice than vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia. It is still unclear whether this affirmation holds for other forms of MRSA pneumonia. Further research is needed to define whether newer antibiotics are better alternatives than currently recommended agents.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^115g3ewR]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Interestingly, strong recommendations were also made against proposals to adopt penicillin plus gentamicin for severe pneumonia and ceftriaxone for very severe pneumonia. Although evidence was largely absent, and thus did not support these proposals, such regimens were admitted to be common local practice. Here a major reason given for strongly rejecting what was already being practiced, in support of existing recommendations, was the perceived need to preserve the alternative treatments as second line regimens in the absence of viable alternatives. It is thus possible that here discussions on the absence of evidence supporting superiority of non-guideline regimens being used in practice may have helped to rebuild confidence in existing guidelines. In line with the evidence presented, the panel made a strong recommendation to abandon chloramphenicol as an alternative treatment to benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin for very severe pneumonia. In this case, although the decision was consistent with the moderate quality evidence, much of the data summarized was from non-African children. This contrasts with rejection of similar quality evidence, also from non-African children, referred to above in the case of amoxicillin in severe pneumonia. In this case we speculate that abandoning chloramphenicol may have resonated with existing views that the drug was no longer suitable, having been abandoned by western countries many years ago on the grounds of safety.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117DLH1Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^113cLKAX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116R7qqa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Erythromycin [^113y5A4k]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis.

Resistance

The major route of resistance is modification of the 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit to insensitivity, while efflux can also be significant.

Interactions With Other Antimicrobials

Antagonism exists in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol.

Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Gram-positive bacteria:

Corynebacterium diphtheriae
Corynebacterium minutissimum
Listeria monocytogenes
Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes

Gram-negative bacteria:

Bordetella pertussis
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Other Microorganisms:

Chlamydia trachomatis
Entamoeba histolytica
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Treponema pallidum
Ureaplasma urealyticum

### Cethromycin: a new ketolide antibiotic [^1176z3ou]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, chemistry, microbiology, in vitro susceptibility, mechanism of resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety, drug interactions, dosage, and administration of cethromycin, a new ketolide antibiotic.

Data Sources

Literature was obtained through searching PubMed (1950-October 2012), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-October 2012), and a bibliographic review of published articles. Search terms included cethromycin, ABT-773, ketolide antibiotic, and community-acquired pneumonia.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All available in vitro and preclinical studies, as well as Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies published in English were evaluated to summarize the pharmacology, chemistry, microbiology, efficacy, and safety of cethromycin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

Data Synthesis

Cethromycin, a new ketolide, has a similar mechanism of action to telithromycin with an apparently better safety profile. Cethromycin displays in vitro activity against selected gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. The proposed indication of cethromycin is treatment of mild to moderate community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in patients aged 18 years or older. Based on clinical studies, the recommended dose is 300 mg orally once a day without regard to meals. Cethromycin has an orphan drug designation for tularemia, plague, and anthrax prophylaxis. The Food and Drug Administration denied approval for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in 2009; a recent noninferiority trial showed comparable efficacy between cethromycin and clarithromycin. Preliminary data on adverse effects suggest that cethromycin is safe and gastrointestinal adverse effects appear to be dose-related.

Conclusions

Cethromycin appears to be a promising ketolide for the treatment of mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia. It was denied approval by the FDA in 2009 pending more evidence to show its efficacy, with more recent studies showing its noninferiority to antibiotics for the same indication.

### What can we learn from the time course of untreated and partially treated community-onset Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia? A clinical perspective on superiority and noninferiority trial designs for mild community-acquired pneumonia [^1135MKnh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are no well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials in the recent era that precisely define the magnitude of the drug effect of antimicrobial therapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, there is evidence that ineffective therapies, selected on the basis of the ratio of 24-h area under the concentration curve to minimum inhibitory concentration, associated with a discordant (nonsusceptible in vitro) specific agent (or no therapy) for mild CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased risk of progression to serious CAP. The relatively high rate of clinical success associated with appropriate antimicrobial treatment of mild CAP renders a standard outcome measure of clinical success an unlikely way to differentiate new agents. However, there may be an advantage in composite outcome assessments for mild CAP. Composite-outcomes end points that include time to resolution of morbidity, the use of patient reported-outcomes instruments, and biomarkers are recommended for future studies. Because the composite rate of success in recent randomized clinical trials exceeds 90%, it would seem that a noninferiority margin of 10% is reasonable for trials for mild CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qgUpP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial [^115b249w]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone with or without a macrolide antibiotic is a recommended treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline fosamil compared with ceftriaxone in the treatment of Asian patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this international, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial, adult Asian patients with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III-IV acute community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) for 5–7 days. Patients were randomly assigned via centralised telephone and web-based system; patients and treating clinicians were masked to treatment allocation. Investigators who did study assessments remained masked to treatment allocation until completion of the study. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (8–15 days after last dose of study drug) in the clinically evaluable population. Non-inferiority of ceftaroline fosamil was defined as a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of patients clinically cured of -10% or higher; if non-inferiority was achieved, superiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371838.

Findings

Between Dec 13, 2011, and April 26, 2013, 847 patients were enrolled at 64 centres in China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, of whom 771 were randomly assigned and 764 received study treatment. In the clinically evaluable population (n = 498) 217 (84%) of 258 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 178 (74%) of 240 patients in the ceftriaxone group were clinically cured at the test-of-cure visit (difference 9.9%, 95% CI 2.8–17.1). The superiority of ceftaroline fosamil was consistent across all preplanned patient subgroup analyses (split by age 65 years, age 75 years, sex, PORT risk class, and previous antibiotic use) apart from patients younger than 65 years. The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups and the safety results for ceftaroline fosamil were consistent with the cephalosporin class and previous clinical trial data.

Interpretation

Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg given every 12 h was superior to ceftriaxone 2 g given every 24 h for the treatment of Asian patients with PORT III-IV community-acquired pneumonia. These data suggest that ceftaroline fosamil should be regarded as an alternative to ceftriaxone in empirical treatment regimens for this patient population.

### Issues in noninferiority trials: the evidence in community-acquired pneumonia [^116ZVVFx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

When investigators hypothesize that experimental interventions provide advantages other than improved effectiveness, they can use noninferiority (NI) trials to determine whether one can rule out the possibility that those interventions have unacceptably worse effectiveness than the standard "active control" regimen. To conduct valid NI trials, there must be evidence from historical studies that provides reliable, reproducible, and precise estimates of the effect of the active control, compared with that of placebo, on the specific outcomes investigators plan to use in the NI trial; this effect should be of substantial magnitude, and the estimates of the active control's effect from historical studies must represent its effect in the planned NI trial had a placebo group been included. These conditions allow formulation of an NI margin such that, if the NI trial establishes that the effectiveness of the experimental intervention is not worse than the effectiveness of the active control by more than the NI margin, then one can conclude that the experimental regimen (1) preserves a substantial fraction of the effect of the active control and (2) will not result in a clinically meaningful loss of effectiveness. After general discussion of NI trial design issues, we consider the design of NI trials to evaluate antimicrobials in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. We present an extensive literature review, allowing estimation of the historical effect of active control regimens in community-acquired pneumonia primarily on the basis of evidence related to use of sulfonamides or penicillin. This review allows formulation of NI margins that are specific to age and bacteremia status of patients.

### Inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococci: should clinicians and microbiologists be concerned? [^1174WAV2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The increasing incidence of a variety of infections due to Staphylococcus aureus — and, especially, the expanding role of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) — has led to emphasis on the need for safe and effective agents to treat both systemic and localized staphylococcal infections. Unlike most previously noted strains of health care-associated MRSA, community-acquired MRSA isolates are often susceptible to several non- beta -lactam drug classes, although they are usually not susceptible to macrolides. Several newer antimicrobial agents and a few older agents are available for treatment of systemic staphylococcal infections, but use may be limited by the relatively high cost of these agents or the need for parenteral administration. Inexpensive oral agents for treatment of localized, community-acquired MRSA infection include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and newer tetracyclines. Clindamycin has been used successfully to treat pneumonia and soft-tissue and musculoskeletal infections due to MRSA in adults and children. However, concern over the possibility of emergence of clindamycin resistance during therapy has discouraged some clinicians from prescribing that agent. Simple laboratory testing (e.g., the erythromycin-clindamycin "D-zone" test) can separate strains that have the genetic potential (i.e., the presence of erm genes) to become resistant during therapy from strains that are fully susceptible to clindamycin.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117XVXpo]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### Pharmacologic treatment options for nosocomial pneumonia involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^113Hk877]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss current and potential treatment options for nosocomial pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2007) was conducted to identify English-language literature on pharmacotherapy of nosocomial pneumonia and the bibliographies of pertinent articles. Programs and abstracts from infectious disease meetings were also searched. Search terms included MRSA, nosocomial pneumonia, pulmonary infections, vancomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and ceftobiprole. DATA SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were critically evaluated and all pertinent information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Vancomycin has been the drug of choice for MRSA infections for many years. Recent data suggest that linezolid may be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. However, there are limitations to the available data. Therefore, prospective, randomized studies are needed before linezolid is recommended as the preferred first-line therapy. Other approved agents for nosocomial MRSA infections, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin, should not be used in the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, as they were inferior in clinical trials. Tigecycline has excellent activity against MRSA in vitro, but should not be routinely used for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia, as clinical data are lacking. In a Phase III clinical trial, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, ceftobiprole, is being evaluated for effectiveness against nosocomial pneumonia. Investigational glycopeptides may eventually have a role in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, but data are currently lacking.

Conclusions

Vancomycin is still the drug of choice for treatment of MRSA pneumonia, and linezolid should be used as an alternative agent. Linezolid should carry strong consideration for patients with vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity or a documented lack of response to vancomycin. Tigecycline and investigational agents with activity against MRSA may be future options for nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA.

### Clindamycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116Jn3Z6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The strain was susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.125 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.125 mg/L), erythromycin (MIC 0.125 mg/L), linezolid (MIC 1.5 mg/L), quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC 0.5 mg/L), and telithromycin (MIC < 0.0035 mg/L); it was not susceptible to penicillin (MIC 0.125 mg/L) and was resistant to clindamycin (MIC 1 mg/L). A triple disk–diffusion test with erythromycin, clindamycin, and josamycin was performed to test resistance inducibility. No inducible pattern was shown.

To understand the possible resistance mechanism, MICs for 2 lincosamides (clindamycin and lincomycin) were determined by using a microbroth dilution method in the presence and absence of 10 mg/L of the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO, USA), as described; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and S. mitis 21A29 (mefE +) were used as controls. The MICs remained unchanged in the presence of reserpine: 1 mg/L for clindamycin and 4 mg/L for lincomycin.

The strain was screened for erm TR, erm B or mef A, and mef E determinants as described. All PCR controls gave the expected results. No PCR product was obtained for the studied isolate.

Preliminary data did not show classic macrolide resistance determinants for S. pneumoniae. Low-level lincosamide resistance suggests the presence of some efflux mechanism, even if no inhibition by reserpine was observed. Moreover, no mutations of ribosomal proteins and of known binding sites for lincosamides in rRNA were shown by sequencing of L22, L4, and 23S rRNA domain II and V genes with primers described by Canu et al. Although these findings are preliminary and the molecular basis for resistance is the subject of ongoing investigation, the identification of this S. pneumoniae phenotype may affect clinical management of pneumococcal infections, especially in the treatment of patients intolerant of β-lactams.

### Framework for optimisation of the clinical use of colistin and polymyxin B: the prato polymyxin consensus [^11251z7X]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

In the face of diminishing therapeutic options for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria, clinicians are increasingly using colistin and polymyxin B. These antibiotics became available clinically in the 1950s, when understanding of antimicrobial pharmacology and regulatory requirements for approval of drugs was substantially less than today. At the 1st International Conference on Polymyxins in Prato, Italy, 2013, participants discussed a set of key objectives that were developed to explore the factors affecting the safe and effective use of polymyxins, identify the gaps in knowledge, and set priorities for future research. Participants identified several factors that affect the optimum use of polymyxins, including: confusion caused by several different conventions used to describe doses of colistin; an absence of appropriate pharmacopoeial standards for polymyxins; outdated and diverse product information; and uncertainties about susceptibility testing and breakpoints. High-priority areas for research included: better definition of the effectiveness of polymyxin-based combination therapy compared with monotherapy via well designed, randomised controlled trials; examination of the relative merits of colistin versus polymyxin B for various types of infection; investigation of pharmacokinetics in special patient populations; and definition of the role of nebulised polymyxins alone or in combination with intravenous polymyxins for the treatment of pneumonia. The key areas identified provide a roadmap for action regarding the continued use of polymyxins, and are intended to help with the effective and safe use of these important, last-line antibiotics.

### How should we dose antibiotics for pneumonia in the ICU? [^117CAqHP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia continues to be a common reason for, or complication of, ICU admission. Associated morbidity and mortality remain high, with an increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, both in terms of spectrum of cover and dose, remains the cornerstone of effective management.

Recent Findings

Critically ill patients will frequently manifest significantly altered end-organ function, as compared with an ambulatory or ward-based setting. Such changes can have profound effects on antibiotic drug handling, promoting subtherapeutic concentrations, treatment failure or the selection of resistant organisms. Standard antibiotic regimens typically fail to consider such issues, with recent literature highlighting the need for improved dosing to achieve sufficient intrapulmonary concentrations, particularly in the setting of augmented elimination. Although recent clinical trials utilizing strategies that optimize drug exposure (either through the use of agents with improved penetration, or continuous infusions) demonstrate superior surrogate outcomes, a mortality benefit is still uncertain.

Summary

Antibiotic dosing strategies that are adapted to a critical care environment are urgently needed, both to improve clinical outcomes and ensure therapeutic longevity. Similarly, study protocols investigating emerging antibiotics must also be designed accordingly, to prevent potential setbacks in drug availability.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^116uKWhT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patients and Setting

De-identified electronic patient record data were obtained from Oxford University Hospitals, UK, using the Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database, which has Research Ethics Committee, Health Research Authority, and Confidentiality Advisory Group approvals (19/SC/0403, 19/CAG/0144) for use of data without individual patient consent.

We included all adults (≥ 16 years of age) admitted to Oxford University Hospitals between 1 January 2016 and 19 March 2024 with a primary diagnosis code of pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] J13–J18) in the first episode (or part) of each admission, that is, only considering patients for whom pneumonia was plausibly the reason for hospital admission. We excluded patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection secondary diagnosis codes (ICD-10 U07.1/U07.2) or admitted from 1 February 2020 to 31 May 2020 (ie, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing) to avoid including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Linked microbiology and radiology data were used to assess the performance of coding data for identifying pneumonia (Supplementary Methods). Out-of-hospital mortality was available from a national information system recording all UK deaths.

Exposures, Outcomes, and Covariates

All antibiotics prescribed in the hospital, intravenous/oral and inpatient/postdischarge, received within −12 to +24 hours of admission were considered baseline antibiotics. As main exposures, we compared 4 groups of patients — that is, those who received baseline amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, with or without an additional macrolide (clarithromycin, azithromycin, or erythromycin). We also included as separate binary variables whether patients received additional doxycycline or gentamicin. Although gentamicin would not provide effective treatment for pneumonia, adding gentamicin to a β-lactam was part of hospital guidelines for empirically managing sepsis with an uncertain source, so provided some adjustment for clinician assessment of disease severity. We excluded patients who received both amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav in the baseline window or who received any antibiotics other than those listed above in the baseline period.

IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP empiric antipseudomonal regimen selection — The panel suggested using 2 antipseudomonal agents from 2 different classes for empiric treatment of patients with risk factors for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and in units where > 10% of VAPs are resistant to an agent being considered for monotherapy; despite meta-analysis showing no difference in mortality, clinical response, adverse effects, or acquired resistance between one vs two antipseudomonal agents, trials often excluded high-risk or colonized patients, and the panel notes that once a pathogen is identified and susceptibilities are known, there is no reason to continue combination therapy.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — MRSA risk and agents: We suggest including an agent active against MRSA for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP only in patients with any of the following: a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance (Table 2), patients being treated in units where > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, and patients in units where the prevalence of MRSA is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials for the treatment of pneumonia in seriously ill patients: maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing selection of resistant organisms [^115dgmC5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Among various risk factors for death among critically ill patients with serious infection, inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor that clinicians can modify directly. The presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is the primary reason that patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia receive inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. Empirical antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia should be initiated promptly and should have a broad spectrum that covers all potential antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Delaying the start of therapy or modifying an inappropriate antimicrobial regimen does not improve outcome, probably because the change comes too late to redirect the course of illness. Timely empirical therapy with highly effective agents that are rapidly bactericidal could minimize the emergence of resistance. Broad-spectrum therapy should be streamlined (i.e., de-escalated), as appropriate, on the basis of microbiological data and clinical response. Switching to narrower-spectrum therapy that is directed by culture results may minimize the emergence of resistance. For some patients, clinical response will allow a shortening of the duration of antimicrobial therapy.

Combination versus monotherapy for empiric gram-negative VAP coverage — across randomized studies of one vs 2 antipseudomonal agents, 7 eligible trials were identified and there were no differences in mortality, clinical response, adverse effects, or acquired resistance between monotherapy and combination arms; many studies allowed adjunctive empiric Pseudomonas coverage until pathogens were identified, limiting applicability to unselected suspected VAP.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) — antibiotic selection and outcomes: We recommend that MRSA HAP/VAP be treated with either vancomycin or linezolid rather than other antibiotics or antibiotic combinations (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Our systematic review identified 7 randomized trials that addressed the selection of antibiotics for HAP/VAP caused by MRSA; four trials compared linezolid to vancomycin, and the remaining 3 trials compared telavancin, quinupristin plus dalfopristin, or vancomycin plus rifampin to vancomycin alone. Meta-analyses of the 4 linezolid–vancomycin trials found no difference in mortality using intention-to-treat (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, .77–1.16) or modified intention-to-treat (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, .37–1.80) strategies; clinical cure did not differ by intention-to-treat, but improved with linezolid in a modified intention-to-treat analysis (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.00–1.40). Linezolid and vancomycin appear to confer no clear difference in nephrotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, serious adverse events, or need for treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 400 mg [^111REuC9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Community Acquired Pneumonia

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the US to compare the efficacy of moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily) to that of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 474 patients (382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 to 35 day follow-up visit). Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95% (184/194) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 95% (178/188) for high dose clarithromycin.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the US and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an oral fluoroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 516 patients, 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 to 30 day post-therapy visit. The clinical success rate was 86% (157/182) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride therapy and 89% (161/180) for the fluoroquinolone comparators.

An open-label ex-US study that enrolled 628 patients compared moxifloxacin hydrochloride to sequential oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (625 mg orally every 8 hours) with or without high-dose oral clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day). The intravenous formulations of the comparators are not FDA approved. The clinical success rate at Day 5 to 7 for moxifloxacin hydrochloride therapy was 93% (241/258) and demonstrated superiority to amoxicillin/clavulanate ± clarithromycin (85%, 239/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.9%, 13.2%)]. The clinical success rate at the 21 to 28 days post-therapy visit for moxifloxacin hydrochloride was 84% (216/258), which also demonstrated superiority to the comparators (74%, 208/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.6%, 16.3%)].
