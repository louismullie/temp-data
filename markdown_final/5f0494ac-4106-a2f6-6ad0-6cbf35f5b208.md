## Question

Medications considered first line to treat attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are Schedule:

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which controlled-substance schedule the first-line medications for attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder belong to. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the first-line pharmacologic treatments are for ADHD across ages. Then, I should verify the specific drug classes and examples. Next, I will check the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration scheduling for those agents. Finally, I will reconcile any nuances, such as age-specific recommendations and non-stimulant alternatives, and confirm the bottom line answer with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the first-line treatments. Across major guidelines and high-quality evidence syntheses, stimulant medications are recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults, with methylphenidate generally preferred in pediatric populations and amphetamines often preferred in adults, while atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists are non-stimulant options when stimulants are not suitable or not tolerated [^1f9b3e7a] [^060fced1] [^4ca9c020] [^7ec2b0eb].

> Wait, let me verify the specific drug classes and examples. The stimulant classes are methylphenidate (e.g., immediate-release, extended-release, dexmethylphenidate) and amphetamines (e.g., mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine), which are consistently used as first-line agents in routine care and clinical trials, while atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are non-stimulant alternatives used when stimulants are contraindicated or not tolerated [^f06ecc09] [^4ca9c020] [^7ec2b0eb].

> I need to check the DEA scheduling. Methylphenidate and amphetamine products are Schedule II controlled substances in the United States due to abuse potential, which means they are available by prescription only with strict dispensing controls and no refills without a new prescription, whereas atomoxetine is not a controlled substance and guanfacine and clonidine are not scheduled as controlled substances either, though they still require prescription oversight for safety reasons [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any first-line exceptions change the schedule. Even though non-stimulants like atomoxetine or alpha-2 agonists can be reasonable first-line choices in specific contexts (e.g., comorbid substance use disorder, significant cardiovascular risk, or stimulant intolerance), the prevailing first-line recommendation remains stimulants, which are Schedule II, so the answer to "first-line medications are Schedule… " is Schedule II for the stimulant class that guidelines prioritize [^0893c7a6] [^a0acd935] [^1f9b3e7a] [^060fced1].

> But wait, what if the question is about international scheduling rather than U.S. scheduling? I should double-check that the user is asking about U.S. DEA schedules. Given the phrasing and the predominance of U.S. guideline sources in the provided materials, the appropriate answer is framed to U.S. scheduling, where methylphenidate and amphetamines are Schedule II, and that aligns with the first-line pharmacologic status in U.S. practice guidelines and comparative effectiveness reviews [^1f9b3e7a] [^4ca9c020] [^7ec2b0eb].

> Final answer: The first-line medications for attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are stimulants, specifically methylphenidate and amphetamines, which are Schedule II controlled substances in the United States [^1f9b3e7a] [^060fced1] [^4ca9c020] [^7ec2b0eb].

---

First-line medications for ADHD are **Schedule II stimulants** (methylphenidate and amphetamines) [^notfound] because of their high abuse potential and strict prescribing controls. Non-stimulant options like atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are **not controlled substances** and are used when stimulants are unsuitable or ineffective [^0893c7a6]. Prescribing requires careful monitoring for misuse, diversion, and adverse effects, especially in patients with substance use disorders [^d85a546b].

---

## First-line medications for ADHD

First-line pharmacologic treatment for ADHD includes **stimulant medications**, which have robust evidence of efficacy in reducing core symptoms and improving functioning [^b76e79c1] [^7ec2b0eb]. The two main classes are:

- **Methylphenidate**: Includes immediate-release and extended-release formulations (e.g. Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin) [^f06ecc09].
- **Amphetamines**: Includes mixed amphetamine salts and lisdexamfetamine (e.g. Adderall, Vyvanse) [^f06ecc09].

These medications are recommended as first-line therapy across age groups, with **methylphenidate preferred in children and adolescents** and **amphetamines in adults** based on comparative efficacy and tolerability [^4ca9c020] [^7ec2b0eb].

---

## Controlled substance scheduling

Controlled substances are classified by the DEA into five schedules based on abuse potential, accepted medical use, and safety. Schedule II substances have a **high abuse potential** with accepted medical use, requiring strict prescribing controls.

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Dea schedule** |
|-|-|-|
| Methylphenidate | Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin | Schedule II |
| Amphetamines | Adderall, Vyvanse | Schedule II |
| Atomoxetine | Strattera | Not controlled |
| Guanfacine | Intuniv | Not controlled |
| Clonidine | Kapvay | Not controlled |

---

Methylphenidate and amphetamines are **Schedule II** due to their abuse potential, whereas atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are not controlled substances [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of schedule ii classification

The Schedule II status of stimulant medications has **important clinical implications**:

- **Prescription regulations**: Schedule II medications require a written prescription, with no refills allowed. New prescriptions are needed for each refill [^notfound].
- **Monitoring and documentation**: Clinicians must monitor for misuse, diversion, and adverse effects, documenting ongoing assessment and follow-up [^4f899082].
- **Special considerations**: In patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, extended-release formulations and enhanced monitoring are recommended to mitigate misuse risk [^d85a546b].

---

## Alternative medications

When stimulants are contraindicated or not tolerated, **non-stimulant medications** are recommended:

- **Atomoxetine**: A selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, effective for ADHD symptoms [^7ec2b0eb].
- **Guanfacine and clonidine**: Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, useful for ADHD symptoms, particularly with comorbid tics or sleep disturbances [^db057e43].

These medications are **not controlled substances** and may be preferred in patients with substance use disorders or significant cardiovascular risk [^0893c7a6].

---

## Conclusion

First-line medications for ADHD are **Schedule II stimulants** (methylphenidate and amphetamines), reflecting their high abuse potential and the need for strict prescribing controls. Non-stimulant alternatives are not controlled substances and are used when stimulants are unsuitable. Clinicians must balance efficacy with safety, monitoring for misuse and adverse effects, especially in patients with substance use disorders [^d85a546b].

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent mental health services, in the United States as well as in many other countries. Medication, including stimulant and nonstimulant options, is an important element of the multimodal approach to ADHD management. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment. 1 A recent study including data from more than 150 million individuals in 13 countries showed an increase in the prevalence of ADHD medications use over the past 15 years in all countries, albeit with large variations across countries. 2 One of the aspects that remains controversial in relation to stimulants pertains to their long-term effectiveness.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, or a combination. It is estimated to affect around 5% of school-age children (aged ≤ 18 years)and 2·5% of adults worldwide. Annual incremental costs for ADHD have been estimated at US$143–266 billion in the USAand are substantial in other countries. Available pharmacological treatments for ADHD include psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulant medications (eg, atomoxetine and α2-agonists). In the past few decades, prescriptions for ADHD drugs have increased significantly both in the USAand other countries. However, even though recommended in clinical guidelines, the efficacy and safety of ADHD medications remains controversial. Furthermore, current guidelines are inconsistent in their treatment recommendations., Although some guidelines rank methylphenidate over amphetamines (eg, in children), others recommend psychostimulants as first-line treatment without any distinction between methylphenidate and amphetamines being made. Additionally, the non-psychostimulant atomoxetine is variously recommended by available guidelines as third-line, second-line, and potentially first-line treatment. The methods used for sequencing these recommendations are not always specified and most commonly — including the 2018 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines — incorporate national drug licencing regulatory approval and cost-effectiveness with expert opinion in conjunction with the few head-to-head comparisons that are available.

ADHD KAS 5a — preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD: The PCC should prescribe evidence-based behavioral parent training in behavior management (PTBM) and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the first line of treatment, if available (grade A: strong recommendation); methylphenidate may be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in functioning, and where behavioral treatments are unavailable the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (grade B: strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for PTBM and Grade B for methylphenidate with a strong recommendation, family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan, both therapies increase cost and PTBM requires high family involvement whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects, both PTBM and methylphenidate have relatively low risks and initiating treatment at an early age has additional benefits, and other stimulant or nonstimulant medications have not been adequately studied in this age group.

Key points
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can often be managed with the right treatment.
- Treatment recommendations vary by age group.
- Types of treatment for ADHD include behavior therapy and medications. Treatment types Behavior Therapy
- Behavior therapy, including training for parents; and Medications
- Stimulants
- Non-stimulants. Treatment recommendations By Age Group For children with ADHD younger than 6 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent training in behavior management as the first line of treatment, before medication is tried. For children 6 years of age and older, the recommendations include medication and behavior therapy together — parent training in behavior management for children up to age 12 and other types of behavior therapy and training for adolescents. Schools can be part of the treatment as well.

AAP recommendations also include adding behavioral classroom intervention and school supports. Learn more about how the school environment can be part of treatment. Medications Medication can help children manage their ADHD symptoms in their everyday life and can help them control the behaviors that cause difficulties with family, friends, and at school. Several different types of medications are FDA-approved to treat ADHD in children as young as 6 years of age: Stimulantsare the best-known and most widely used ADHD medications. Between 70–80% of children with ADHD have fewer ADHD symptoms when taking these fast-acting medications. Nonstimulantswere approved for the treatment of ADHD in 2003. They do not work as quickly as stimulants, but their effect can last up to 24 hours. Medications can affect children differently and can have side effects such as decreased appetite or sleep problems. One child may respond well to one medication, but not to another.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (against) [^cd9355ed]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects. Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). Magnitude of effectiveness (eg, small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors (including treatment adherence and study design). Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame (eg, 1 year), which can be applied to specify duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^555608c0]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

While ADHD medications are consistently associated with reduced risk of serious real-world outcomes, the magnitude of these associations have decreased over time alongside rising prescription rates. This underscores the importance of continuously evaluating medication use in different patient populations. Further research is needed to better understand individual-level treatment effects based on patient characteristics, ensuring that clinical decision-making remains well informed.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^6e087246]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has dramatically increased in youth worldwide. Recent prevalence data in some European countries show expanded use with one country now matching US usage. Still, substantial geographic differences by country remain regarding the extent to which children receive ADHD medications. These geographic differences by country raise research questions about which country's prevalence data represents appropriate medication use. We urgently need country level studies to contribute to our understanding of an appropriate prevalence of ADHD medication use.

### Treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: overview of the evidence [^033ce824]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Quality Improvement, Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, reviewed and analyzed the current literature for the purpose of developing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review included several key reports, including an evidence review from the McMaster Evidence-Based Practice Center (supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), a report from the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, the Multimodal Treatment for ADHD comparative clinical trial (supported by the National Institute of Mental Health), and supplemental reviews conducted by the subcommittee. These reviews provided substantial information about different treatments for ADHD and their efficacy in improving certain characteristics or outcomes for children with ADHD as well as adverse effects and benefits of multiple modes of treatment compared with single modes (eg, medication or behavior therapies alone). The reviews also compared the effects of different medications. Other evidence documents the long-term nature of ADHD in children and its classification as a chronic condition, meriting the application of general concepts of chronic-condition management, including an individual treatment plan with a focus on ongoing parent and child education, management, and monitoring. The evidence strongly supports the use of stimulant medications for treating the core symptoms of children with ADHD and, to a lesser degree, for improving functioning. Behavior therapy alone has only limited effect on symptoms or functioning of children with ADHD, although combining behavior therapy with medication seems to improve functioning and may decrease the amount of (stimulant) medication needed. Comparison among stimulants (mainly methylphenidate and amphetamines) did not indicate that 1 class outperformed the other.

Preschool-aged ADHD treatment (KAS 5a) — For preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe evidence-based behavioral PTBM and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the first line of treatment, if available (grade A: strong recommendation). Methylphenidate may be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the 4-through 5-year-old child's functioning. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment (Table 6). (Grade B: strong recommendation.) The overall evidence for PTBM among preschoolers is strong.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider arranging for a parent, health professional, such as trained school nurse, or other trusted adult to directly observe administration of the medication, especially if using a short-acting formulation, in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder with ADHD.
Consider counseling families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

Diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD The AAP guidelines for diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD recommend that healthcare providers complete these steps: Treatment recommendations The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- Children and adolescents with ADHD should be treated the same as would any other child or adolescent with special healthcare needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home. Did you know. AAP treatment guidelines by age group Children ages 4–6 years The first line of treatment should include:

- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. ADHD medications for children ages 4–6 years Methylphenidate may be used in children 4–6 years of age if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvementand the child continues to have serious problems.

School-age children and adolescents Recommended treatment for children and adolescents includes:

- FDA-approved medications along with
- Parent training in behavior management; and/or
- Behavioral classroom interventions. Treatments often work best when used together. For all children attending school, the school is a necessary part of any treatment plan. These plans can include:

- Educational interventions; and
- Individual school supports, such as school environment and behavioral supports. School treatment plans often include an Individualized Education Program or a 504 plan that describes accommodations. Healthcare providers supporting children with special healthcare needs Any child or adolescent who is taking medication The AAP guidelines for treatment of ADHD recommend that
- The healthcare provider adjusts the patient's medication dose as needed to achieve the most benefit with the least amount of tolerable side effects.

Preschool-aged children with ADHD — medication initiation should follow severity-based criteria and evidence. Before initiating medications, "the physician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD," and "only those preschool-aged children with ADHD who have moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication," with severity defined as "symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months," "dysfunction… in both the home and other settings," and lack of adequate response to behavior therapy; if behavior therapy is insufficient, "medication can be prescribed." For dosing, metabolism is slower "in children 4 through 5 years of age," so "they should be given a lower dose to start" with "smaller increments," and "Maximum doses have not been adequately studied." Regarding agents and evidence, "Dextroamphetamine is the only medication approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 6 years of age," but despite on-label status "does not make it possible to recommend at this time," while most evidence is from methylphenidate: "1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller single-site studies… (total of 269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site studies found significant efficacy," though its use in preschoolers "remains off-label."

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, methylphenidate, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged ≥ 6 years with ADHD provided that:

- symptoms are still causing persistent, significant impairment in at least one domain of functioning (education, interpersonal relationships, occupation) after implementing environmental modifications in schools, at home, or in other relevant settings

- a careful assessment of the child/adolescent has been obtained

- the child/adolescent and the caregivers, as appropriate, have been informed about treatment options and supported in decision-making

- methylphenidate prescription is made by, or in consultation with, a specialist.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^b1cea89c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed in order to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed and recommendations on assessment and treatment extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality. Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good. They reflect similarities and differences of healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^daefd46c]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic treatment sequencing by disorder — evidence guidance indicates that traditionally, psychosocial treatments, following their recommended dosing, duration, and monitoring, are recommended before pharmacological treatment, but data are increasingly available from comparative treatment trials to guide the selection of first-line treatment. To date, randomized controlled trials suggest that medication management for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the first-line treatment and that medication combined with behavioral treatment may be required for optimal outcome in children with more complex problems. For obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), beginning with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), especially if delivered by expert psychotherapists, or combined treatment is the best option. In contrast, the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study demonstrated efficacy for combination therapy and medication management but not for cognitive-behavioral therapy alone at 12 weeks, suggesting that beginning with psychotherapy only in moderate to severe depression may not be the best first step. Prescribers are guided by the evidence base in developing their treatment plan, the evidence base for pediatric psychopharmacology is far from complete, and when a disorder precludes active participation in targeted psychosocial treatment (e.g. OCD with psychotic symptoms), beginning with medication and supportive psychological treatment may be a reasonable approach.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^3e9101b2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, that improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and large observational studies further indicate they are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

Until recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly 5-fold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than 10-fold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are seen in other European countries. Research suggests that these increases in prescription are not a response to actual increases in ADHD prevalence, but rather reflect changes in diagnostic criteria and the way that these are interpreted, changes in parental perception of impairment, and increased clinician and community awareness of ADHD. These increases in ADHD medication prescriptions have been particularly pronounced in adults and females. In the US, while the overall prevalence in adults receiving ADHD medication increased from 0.5% to 2.0% from 2001 to 2015, the prevalence in women aged 15 to 44 years increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 4.0% in 2015. These significant shifts highlight a critical question: do those receiving ADHD medication today benefit from the treatment in the same way as those who received it a decade ago? Understanding these evolving dynamics is essential for optimizing treatment strategies across diverse patient populations, as well as for informing treatment guidelines and recommendations for both children and adults.

Stimulant titration and monitoring in pediatric ADHD emphasize individualized dosing and timely follow-up: "it is recommended to titrate from a low dose to one that achieves a maximum, optimal effect in controlling symptoms without adverse effects." "Calculating the dose on the basis of milligrams per kilogram has not usually been helpful because variations in dose have not been found to be related to height or weight." "Stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 7-day basis, but in urgent situations, they may be effectively titrated in as few as 3 days." "The PCC should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication may be necessary for optimal medication management, may require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be monitored at regular intervals."

For elementary school–aged children (6–11 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe US Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for ADHD (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and/or evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation); the evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications and sufficient but less strong for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine (in that order) (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation), and the school environment, program, or placement is a part of any treatment plan. For adolescents (12–18 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for ADHD with the assent of the adolescent (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD (quality of evidence C/recommendation), preferably both.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (for) [^f8be48f4]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as the ADHD medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. As a consequence, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies. Although these provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy, 1 they do not speak to long-term effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will usually be required to be taken for several years. They therefore introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy. This has generally been done through the use of randomized withdrawal designs that are designed to demonstrate continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several of these have been completed and published, all of which, as expected, demonstrate continued efficacy. 2 The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness, and that adverse effects and safety be assessed up to 2 years. Again the studies completed so far support continued effectiveness, and, although highlighting the presence of common, expected adverse effects, have not identified any new safety signals or unexpected problems in targeted areas such as growth and cognition. 3.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (UK and Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (abstracts and international), and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform, including, from the date of database inception to April 7, 2017, with no language restrictions. We used the search terms "adhd" OR "hkd" OR "addh" OR "hyperkine" OR "attention deficit" OR "hyper-activ" OR "hyperactiv" OR "overactive" OR "inattentive" OR "impulsiv" combined with a list of ADHD medications (appendix pp 3–15). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and relevant drug manufacturers' websites, and references of previous systematic reviews and guidelines, were hand-searched for additional information. We also contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to gather unpublished information and data (appendix p 15).

We included double-blind randomised controlled trials (parallel group, crossover, or cluster), of at least 1 week's duration, that enrolled children (aged ≥ 5 years and < 12 years), adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years and < 18 years), or adults (≥ 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-III, DSM III-R, DSM-IV(TR), DSM-5, ICD-9, or ICD-10. We did not restrict our search by ADHD subtype or presentation, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ), socioeconomic status, or comorbidities (except for those needing concomitant pharmacotherapy). We included studies if they assessed any of the following medications, as oral monotherapy, compared with each other or with placebo: amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methyl-phenidate (including dexmethylphenidate), and modafinil. We excluded studies with enrichment designs (eg, trials selecting drug responders only after a run-in phase), because these types of trial can potentially inflate efficacy and tolerability estimates. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the appendix (pp 16, 17).

Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan. Strength: strong recommendation.

### Treatment strategies for ADHD: an evidence-based guide to select optimal treatment [^434500ff]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^a4938211]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Preschool-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — medication evidence, indications, and dosing: Evidence regarding dextroamphetamine's use in preschool-aged children with ADHD is not adequate to recommend it as an initial ADHD medication treatment at this time, and no nonstimulant medication has sufficient rigorous study to be recommended for treatment of ADHD of children 4 through 5 years of age. Although methylphenidate has the strongest evidence for safety and efficacy in preschool-aged children, it has not yet met the level needed for FDA approval; evidence includes 1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller, single-site studies ranging from 11 to 59 children, for a total of 269 children, with seven of the 10 single-site studies revealing efficacy, and its use remains on an off-label basis. Before initiating medication, the clinician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD; only preschool-aged children with ADHD and moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered, defined by symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months, dysfunction in both home and other settings, and dysfunction that has not responded adequately to PTBM. For dosing, the rate of metabolizing methylphenidate is slower in children 4 through 5 years of age, so a low dose should be given to start with increases in smaller increments, and maximum doses have not been adequately studied in preschool-aged children.

### Medical management of ADHD in adults: part 1 [^c20b8d7e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is common, impairing and often unrecognised. Comorbidity is very common and may compound the impact of ADHD. It is important that a diagnosis of ADHD is made following a high-quality assessment. Symptoms and social outcomes can be improved by treatment, particularly medication. Non-pharmacological treatment may be more effective in those who are also on medication, and psychoeducation and environmental modifications are also important. Stimulants such as methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine are recommended first choice medications. The choice of drug can be tailored to patients' circumstances, especially intended duration of action, then titrated week by week, according to response.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^7b9ddf7f]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — medication titration and monitoring in primary care states Action statement 6: Primary care clinicians should titrate doses of medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Because stimulants might produce positive but suboptimal effects at a low dose in some children and youth, titration to maximum doses that control symptoms without adverse effects is recommended instead of titration strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram basis. The findings from the MTA study suggested that more than 70% of children and youth with ADHD respond to one of the stimulant medications at an optimal dose when a systematic trial is used, and stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis. Children in the MTA who were treated in the community with care as usual received lower doses of stimulants with less frequent monitoring and had less optimal results. Education of parents is an important component to ensure cooperation in titration, and the primary care clinician should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication type might be necessary, that the process might require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be systematically monitored at regular intervals.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: a longitudinal study [^f691f819]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When investigating factors that could potentially explain the current patterns of ADHD medication consumption, we found that local ADHD prevalence estimates and geographical regions were not significantly associated with ADHD medication consumption. Findings by Polanczyk et al. suggested that when methodological differences were taken into account, the true prevalence of ADHD in contrast to the reported estimates from individual studies, did not increase over a 27-year time span, and was similar across geographical locations. Thus, the rise in ADHD medication consumption is unlikely to be associated with increased ADHD prevalence. It may however be due to increased recognition of the important role of pharmacological treatment of ADHD. The lack of regional effect on trends of ADHD medication consumption is consistent with previous findings on ADHD medication use. In addition, even within the same region, national guidelines and practices may differ substantially in their recommendations on the roles and balance between pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. Non-pharmacological therapy is recommended as the first-line therapy or preferred in combination with pharmacotherapy for children with ADHD in some age groups in some countries. However, this only partially explains the enormous differences in national ADHD medication consumption rates. Other factors may include physician-level differences in diagnostic and treatment practices, health budget allocation, cost structure and reimbursement status of ADHD medications, education policies, and cultural perceptions on medication use.

### Attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder in preschool-age children: issues and concerns [^3053edf4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children has been steadily increasing over the past 10 years. ADHD is associated with numerous health, behavioral, social, and academic outcomes. The use of medication is common for the treatment of ADHD. However, the evidence base for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for children younger than 6 years of age is limited. Both short-term and long-term studies of efficacy and safety of all interventions are needed in this population, especially the use of psychotropic medications. Understanding the long-term effects of psychotropic medication on the developing brains of preschoolers has important implications for outcomes into adulthood. Nonpharmacologic evidence-based interventions are available and should serve as the first line of treatment in this population. Future research needs include further evidence regarding specific curricula, dose, duration, delivery methods, and staff training to ensure optimal intervention outcomes.

### Antipsychotic treatment among youths with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^96aeeda7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How commonly are youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treated with antipsychotic medications and what factors are associated with their use of antipsychotic treatment?

Findings

In this cohort study of 187 563 commercially insured youths with new episodes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 2.3% were treated with an antipsychotic medication, among whom 52.7% had a potential clinical diagnostic rationale for antipsychotic treatment. Factors for antipsychotic medication use included older patient age, male sex, recent inpatient and other pharmacologic mental health treatments, self-harm/suicidal ideation; and oppositional defiant, substance use, depressive, and anxiety disorders.

Meaning

Approximately 1 in 40 commercially insured youths were treated with an antipsychotic medication without an approved indication in the year following a new attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis; mental health comorbidities may be associated with antipsychotic treatment in this group.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^ab09d593]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is commonly known to occur during childhood, is characterized by excessive inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity as well as executive dysfunction, lack of emotional self-control and motivation. However a significant number of affected children (65%) continue manifesting symptoms into adulthood.

The prevalence of ADHD was reported as 5.3% in childhood, whereas it is estimated as 2.5–4.9% in adulthood. Clinical research showed that the predominant features of ADHD in adults differ from ADHD in children, with adults showing less obvious symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity and more inattentive symptoms. A recent study reported follow-back analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in adulthood, alongside follow-forward analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in childhood in a representative birth cohort from Dunedin. The findings suggested that adults with ADHD may not have a childhood-onset disorder. There was little overlap between participants who had been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and those diagnosed in adulthood. This finding is intriguing but difficult to interpret because it is not consistent with a very large literature documenting the persistence of ADHD into adulthood. Pharmacological treatment is considered effective and safe both for children and adults, but there is considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding response to medication, required doses, and adverse events. Pharmacotherapy with methylphenidate (MPH) seems to be the first-line treatment of choice both in children, and in adults, with ADHD.

### Updates in pharmacologic strategies in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1e5483bb]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly worsens quality of life and long-term functional outcomes in adults. Individual impairments in adults with ADHD can be further contextualized within considerable costs to society at large. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved stimulants and nonstimulant medications can significantly improve ADHD symptoms in adults. In the past 2 decades, the United States FDA has expanded approval of pharmacotherapeutic options for adult ADHD. However, limitations still persist in available psychotropics for certain patient populations such as those with comorbid substance use or cardiovascular illness. Clinicians therefore must appreciate several ongoing investigations into medications with unique mechanisms of action. This article reviews the current FDA approved and emerging medication options while providing guidelines for pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^4ca9c020]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Accounting for all included outcomes, our results support methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as the first pharmacological choice for ADHD. In fact, in adults, amphetamines were not only the most efficacious compounds, as rated by clinicians and by self-report, but also as well tolerated as methylphenidate and the only compounds with better acceptability than placebo. In children and adolescents, even though amphetamines were marginally superior to methylphenidate according to clinicians' ratings, methylphenidate was the only compound with better acceptability than placebo and, unlike amphetamines, was not worse than placebo in terms of tolerability. Additionally, our results on secondary outcomes highlight the importance of monitoring weight and blood pressure changes with atomoxetine as much as with stimulants.

Our conclusions from this analysis concur partly with NICE guidelines, in which methylphenidate is recommended as the first choice in children and adolescents and methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine as first choice in adults. Additionally, although NICE recommend atomoxetine or guanfacine as a possible third-line choice in children, our results suggest that, despite comparable efficacy on ADHD core symptoms rated by parents, atomoxetine was equal to placebo in terms of tolerability, whereas guanfacine was worse. However, it is noteworthy that the NICE recommendations were informed not only by empirical evidence but also by considerations on costs and licence and flexibility of formulations.

### Mental health in the United states. prevalence of diagnosis and medication treatment for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder – United States, 2003 [^2b01c8f4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), previously known as attention deficit disorder, is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that often results in substantial functional impairment. Prevalence estimates of ADHD in school-aged children have ranged from 2% to 18% in community samples. Although stimulant medications are an effective first-line treatment for ADHD, concern persists regarding the possible side effects and long-term health outcomes associated with stimulant consumption. Estimating the number of children who have had ADHD diagnosed and are currently taking medication for the disorder is an important step toward understanding the overall burden of ADHD in the United States. Previously, population-based estimates of medication treatment for ADHD were not available or were limited by their lack of generalizability. To estimate rates of parent-reported ADHD diagnosis and medication treatment for ADHD, CDC analyzed data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2003, approximately 4.4 million children aged 4–17 years were reported to have a history of ADHD diagnosis; of these, 2.5 million (56%) were reported to be taking medication for the disorder. Because both substantial health risks and benefits might be associated with medication treatment for ADHD, further study of this population of children with ADHD is needed.

Pharmacogenetic testing to guide ADHD medication choice is not recommended: Although there is interest in tools to predict the best medication and dose for each child or adolescent, the available scientific literature does not provide sufficient evidence to support clinical utility, and for that reason these pharmacogenetics tools are not recommended; in addition, these tests may cost thousands of dollars and are typically not covered by insurance.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^6c4e6c6a]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

Our study, based on advanced methodology for network meta-analyses, represents the most comprehensive synthesis to date on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for ADHD across age groups. Unlike previous network meta-analyses of ADHD treatments, we have included unpublished data, which were gathered systematically from study authors, the websites of regulatory agencies, and drug manufacturers, using a common set of inclusion criteria for trials in children, adolescents, and adults. We focused on a series of clinically relevant outcomes — namely, efficacy on ADHD core symptoms, global clinical functioning, tolerability, effects on weight and blood pressure, and acceptability. We also investigated important effect-modifiers (eg, dose and comorbidities). We retained only a few studies with outcomes beyond 12 weeks. All medications we included in our study (except modafinil in adults) were more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of ADHD. Medications for ADHD were less efficacious and less well tolerated in adults than in children and adolescents. However, included drugs were not equivalent, and their profile in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability varied across age groups.

Implications of all the available evidence

Evidence from our network meta-analysis supports methylphenidate (in children and adolescents) and amphetamines (in adults) as the preferred first pharmacological choice for short-term pharmacological treatment of ADHD. This network meta-analysis should inform future guidelines and daily clinical decision-making on the choice of medications for ADHD across age ranges, along with available evidence on cost-effectiveness and considering patients' preferences. The paucity of trials with randomised outcomes beyond 12 weeks highlights the need to fund studies to assess long-term effects of these drugs. Furthermore, future research should include individual patient data in network meta-analyses of ADHD medications, which will allow a more reliable estimation of predictors of individual response.

The clinical manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often emerge before 6 years of age, and an early onset can portend a more marked and severe clinical course. Given that untreated ADHD can have a negative impact on educational attainment and social functioning, early treatment is indicated, as it might translate into better distal outcomes. For this age group, the current recommendation from clinical guidelines and ADHD experts is to administer behavioral therapy as first-line treatment. Because only limited information has been available on the possible safety implications of long-term pharmacological treatment at young ages, the use of methylphenidate is reserved for cases with impairing ADHD symptoms unresponsive to psychosocial intervention. 1.

AHRQ research questions for ADHD diagnosis and treatment — The subcommittee developed research questions for an evidence-based review sponsored by 1 of the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); these questions assessed 4 diagnostic areas and 3 treatment areas on the basis of research published in 2011 through 2016, guided by key clinical questions for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age. Diagnostic questions addressed the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches usable in primary care or by specialists among children younger than 7 years of age; the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEG, imaging, or executive function approaches among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday; the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or incorrectly as having ADHD; and whether more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests improve the diagnostic process. Treatment questions addressed the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD; the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment; and the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status.

### A comparison of the efficacy of medications for adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder using meta-analysis of effect sizes [^35e0e81b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults have been well researched, but comparisons among drugs are hindered by the absence of direct comparative trials. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the effect size of the medications used to treat adult ADHD, (2) determine if differences in the designs of studies confound comparisons of medication efficacy, (3) quantify the evidence for differences in effect sizes among medications, and (4) see if features of study design influence estimates of efficacy.

Data Sources

The following search engines were used: PubMed, Ovid, ERIC, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, the Cochrane database, e-psyche, and Social Sciences Abstracts. Presentations from the American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meetings were reviewed.

Study Selection

A literature search was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of ADHD in adults published in English after 1979. Only trials that used DSM-III, -III-R, or -IV ADHD criteria and followed subjects for ≥ 2 weeks were selected.

Data Extraction

Meta-analysis regression assessed the influence of medication type and study design features on medication effects.

Results

Nineteen trials met criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. These trials studied 13 drugs using 18 different outcome measures of hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behavior. After trials were stratified on the class of drug studied (short-acting stimulant vs long-acting stimulant vs nonstimulant), significant differences in effect size were observed between stimulant and nonstimulant medications (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0001, respectively, for short- and long-acting stimulants vs nonstimulants), but the effect for short-acting stimulants was not significant after correcting for study design features. The effect sizes for each drug class were similar in magnitude to what we previously reported for medication treatment studies of children with ADHD. We found significant heterogeneity of effect sizes for short-acting stimulants (P < .001) but not for other medication groups.

Conclusions

Although both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are effective for treating ADHD in adults, stimulant medications show greater efficacy for the short durations of treatment characteristic of placebo-controlled studies. We found no significant differences between short- and long-acting stimulant medications. Study design features vary widely among studies and can confound indirect comparisons unless addressed statistically as we have done in this study.

Adjunctive therapy — use with stimulants: Adjunctive therapies may be considered if stimulant therapy is not fully effective or limited by side effects. Only extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine have evidence supporting their use as adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications sufficient to have achieved FDA approval. Other medications have been used in combination on an off-label basis, with some limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of using atomoxetine in combination with stimulant medications to augment treatment of ADHD.

### What place for lisdexamfetamine in children and adolescents with ADHD? [^aea706dc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the commonest behavioural disorder in the UK, affecting 2–5% of school-aged children and young people.(1) Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) state that medication is not indicated as first-line treatment for school-age children and young people with ADHD, but should be reserved for those with severe symptoms and impairment, or those with moderate levels of impairment who have refused non-drug interventions, or those whose symptoms have not responded sufficiently to parent-training/education programmes or group psychological treatment.(2) Current drug options include methylphenidate (first-line), atomoxetine (first- or second-line) or dexamfetamine (second- or third-line).(2) Lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse-Shire Pharmaceuticals) is a prodrug of dexamfetamine, licensed as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for ADHD in children aged 6 years and over when response to previous methylphenidate treatment is considered clinically inadequate.(3,4) Here we review the place of lisdexamfetamine in the management of ADHD in children and adolescents.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^5f58580f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline scope and updates — the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday. For this document, preschool-aged refers to children from age 4 years to the sixth birthday. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Summary

Background

The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.

Findings

133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10 068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; the analysis of tolerability was based on 11 018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to placebo (eg, SMD −1·02, 95% CI −1·19 to −0·85 for amphetamines, −0·78, −0·93 to −0·62 for methylphenidate, −0·56, −0·66 to −0·45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate (SMD −0·82, 95% CI −1·16 to −0·48) and modafinil (−0·76, −1·15 to −0·37) were more efficacious than placebo. In adults (clinicians' ratings), amphetamines (SMD −0·79, 95% CI −0·99 to −0·58), methylphenidate (−0·49, −0·64 to −0·35), bupropion (−0·46, −0·85 to −0·07), and atomoxetine (−0·45, −0·58 to −0·32), but not modafinil (0·16, −0·28 to 0·59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2·30, 95% CI 1·36–3·89) and adults (3·26, 1·54–6·92); guanfacine was inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2·64, 1·20–5·81); and atomoxetine (2·33, 1·28–4·25), methylphenidate (2·39, 1·40–4·08), and modafinil (4·01, 1·42–11·33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians' ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs −0·46 to −0·24) and adults (−0·94 to −0·29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints.

Interpretation

Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^4a0c92a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' 'generalisability'; exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity; responder selection based on previous experience with CNS stimulants; and risk of withdrawal effects. Our prespecified primary outcomes were functional outcomes, self-rated ADHD symptoms, and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, ADHD symptoms rated by investigators and by peers such as family members, cardiovascular variables, severe psychiatric adverse events, and other adverse events.

Main Results

We included 24 trials (5066 participants), of which 21 reported outcome data for this review. We also identified one ongoing study. We included documents from six drug regulatory agencies covering eight trials. Twenty-one trials had an outpatient setting and three were conducted in prisons. They were primarily conducted in North America and Europe. The median participant age was 36 years. Twelve trials (76% of participants) were industry-sponsored, four (14% of participants) were publicly funded with industry involvement, seven (10% of participants) were publicly funded, and one had unclear funding. The median trial duration was eight weeks. One trial was rated at overall unclear risk of bias and 20 trials were rated at overall high risk of bias, primarily due to unclear blinding of participants and investigators, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting. All trials were impaired in at least one of the three design characteristics related to 'generalisability'; for example, they excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety, or included participants only with a previous positive response to methylphenidate, or similar drugs. This may limit the trials' usefulness for clinical practice, as they may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. Extended-release methylphenidate versus placebo (up to 26 weeks) For the primary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' at 13-week follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.15 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.11 to 1.81; 1 trial, 409 participants) or serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, CI 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 14 trials, 4078 participants), whereas methylphenidate improved self-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.30; 16 trials, 3799 participants). For secondary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate improved self-rated quality of life (small effect; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 6 trials, 1888 participants), investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.36; 18 trials, 4183 participants), ADHD symptoms rated by peers such as family members (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; 3 trials, 1005 participants), and increased the risk of experiencing any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.37; 14 trials, 4214 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, primarily due to high risk of bias and 'indirectness of the evidence'. One trial (419 participants) had follow-up at 52 weeks and two trials (314 participants) included active comparators, hence long-term and comparative evidence is limited.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-certainty evidence that extended-release methylphenidate compared to placebo improved ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effects) measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers such as family members. Methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' or serious adverse events, the effect on quality of life was small, and it increased the risk of several adverse effects. We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, due to high risk of bias, short trial durations, and limitations to the generalisability of the results. The benefits and harms of extended-release methylphenidate therefore remain uncertain.

Introduction

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that often persists into adulthood. The prevalence of the disorder in children is 6.5%, while in adults the estimates vary between 2.5 and 3.4%. ADHD patients are at high risk of experiencing difficulties in their education and social integration, elevated rates of incarceration, unemployment and accidental deaths, all resulting in high societal and economic burden. To date, no treatments cure ADHD, although available therapies offer symptomatic relief.

Current management of ADHD is based on either non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatments as well as the combination of the two. The non-pharmacologic treatments usually involve psychological and/or behavioural therapies, while the pharmacologic interventions include stimulant and/or non-stimulant drugs. For ADHD treatment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the stimulants methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP) along with three non-stimulants: atomoxetine, clonidine and guanfacine. In many guidelines, MPH and AMP are the first-line agents for ADHD pharmacotherapy, exerting their primary effect by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine activity. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, while both clonidine and guanfacine are alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists. Although all the pharmaceuticals used to manage ADHD are believed to act on biological pathways underlying the disorder, their complete mechanisms of action remain unknown, as are the causal biological mechanisms of ADHD.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^418c3383]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Preschool-aged ADHD treatment (ages 4–5 years) — behavioral therapy and medication considerations — are summarized: A number of special circumstances support the recommendation to initiate ADHD treatment in preschool-aged children (ages 4–5 years) with behavioral therapy alone first; the multisite study of methylphenidate was limited to preschool-aged children who had moderate-to-severe dysfunction, and many children (ages 4–5 years) experience improvements in symptoms with behavior therapy alone with overall evidence for behavior therapy in preschool-aged children described as strong. Behavioral programs for children 4 to 5 years of age typically run as group parent-training programs and have a lower cost. Many young children with ADHD might still require medication, medication is not contraindicated for children 4 through 5 years of age, and only 1 multisite study has carefully assessed medication use in preschool-aged children.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^e2813112]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive behavioral developmental disorder most commonly seen in childhood and adolescence, which often extends to the adult years. Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients, and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

Pharmacological treatment for ADHD and ASD in children and adults

A summary of the consensus reached regarding pharmacological interventions for ADHD and ASD when these conditions present as a comorbid diagnosis (in both children and adults) is presented in Table 10.

The pharmacological treatment for co-occurring ASD and ADHD in children and adults is no different from the treatment of each disorder separately. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines should be followed for the pharmacological treatment of ADHD as a separate condition; medication is commonly offered to treat ADHD symptoms (usually stimulant and non-stimulant medications) in both people with ADHD and those with co-occurring ADHD and ASD. ADHD medications should not be offered to treat people with ASD (without co-occurring ADHD) as there is no evidence for a positive effect in this population.

Table 10
Practice recommendations for children and adults with comorbid ADHD and ASD: pharmacological interventions

Indeed, there is no orthodox pharmacological treatment for ASD in either children or adults that has an evidence base for treatment effect. Antipsychotic medication for core ASD symptoms has been used widely in certain countries; however, the evidence base supporting its use in this population is negligible and the risk of adverse effects is high. The second-generation antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, have been used for the short-term treatment of angry outbursts in children and adolescents with ASD, some of whom will have ADHD. Low doses, regular reviews and short-term use are advised. However, there are variable degrees of official approval for their use between countries and behavioural and environmental interventions are first-line treatments. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications are not clearly helpful for treating repetitive behaviours in children and adults with comorbid ASD and ADHD.

### Post hoc analyses of response rates to pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^775aecc2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 5–7% in children and adolescents. ADHD often persists beyond childhood, with the prevalence in adults reported to be 3–5%, with some variability across countries. Guidelines from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommend that clinical trials of ADHD medications report responder analyses, as well as evaluate symptomatic outcomes at the group level, in order to understand the benefits (or otherwise) of investigational treatments better at the level of the individual participants, thus providing health-care professionals with an indication of the likelihood of success with a particular treatment regimen.

Clinical response may be based on improvements in symptom scales such as the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV;), the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham version IV (SNAP-IV;) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, with or without a Clinical Global Impressions – Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved;). However, there is currently no clear consensus on appropriate thresholds for a clinically meaningful response using these instruments. Thresholds that have been used include a CGI-I score of 1 or 2, either alone or in combination with a decrease in ADHD-RS-IV total score of at least 25% for a partial response or more than 50% for a more robust response. Some investigators argue that symptom score in responders should be within the range for unaffected individuals. To this end, a 65% reduction in symptom scale score has been proposed, as has an ADHD-RS-IV total score at the end point of ≤ 18 – a score considered by some to represent symptom remission on treatment.

### Pharmacologic treatment of comorbid attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and tourette and tic disorders [^db057e43]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

A complete and comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation is necessary to delineate tic symptoms from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and to prioritize the most problematic symptoms for intervention. Stimulants are the recommended first-line pharmacotherapy to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in patients with tic disorders. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics is an effective behavioral therapy that is generally considered the first-line treatment of persistent tic disorders. α-Agonists can be added to stimulants if tics increase or be used as monotherapy to target attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tics. Atomoxetine is also an excellent option to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tics.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^120dab1c]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.

Findings

133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; the analysis of tolerability was based on 11018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to placebo (eg, SMD -1·02, 95% CI -1·19 to -0·85 for amphetamines, -0·78, -0·93 to -0·62 for methylphenidate, -0·56, -0·66 to -0·45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate (SMD -0·82, 95% CI -1·16 to -0·48) and modafinil (-0·76, -1·15 to -0·37) were more efficacious than placebo. In adults (clinicians' ratings), amphetamines (SMD -0·79, 95% CI -0·99 to -0·58), methylphenidate (-0·49, -0·64 to -0·35), bupropion (-0·46, -0·85 to -0·07), and atomoxetine (-0·45, -0·58 to -0·32), but not modafinil (0·16, -0·28 to 0·59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2·30, 95% CI 1·36–3·89) and adults (3·26, 1·54–6·92); guanfacine was inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2·64, 1·20–5·81); and atomoxetine (2·33, 1·28–4·25), methylphenidate (2·39, 1·40–4·08), and modafinil (4·01, 1·42–11·33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians' ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs -0·46 to -0·24) and adults (-0·94 to -0·29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints.

Interpretation

Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: an integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^1424c3f8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Access to clinical resources for ADHD in adults remains limited in many countries, in part because of the traditional perspective that ADHD is a problem restricted to childhood and due to the lack of approved treatments in many countries. However, awareness of ADHD in adults is growing rapidly and there is now an urgent need to broaden understanding of the condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of available therapeutic interventions.

Based on current evidence, national and international guidelines recommend drug treatments as the first-line of clinical management for ADHD in adults, particularly where the disorder is associated with moderate-to-severe levels of impairment. In the USA a wide range of pharmacological treatments are approved for use in adults, including atomoxetine (ATX), methylphenidate (MPH), dexmethylphenidate, and various amphetamines. ATX was approved in the EU in May 2013 for initiation in adults to treat ADHD. No other medications are approved in Europe to be initiated for treatment of ADHD in adults, except in Germany only, where a long-acting form of MPH is approved since 2011.

Results

We identified 14 431 records. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant references we retrieved 1461 publications in full text for assessment of eligibility. Overall we excluded 691 publications for not meeting the inclusion criteria and eight because they were classified as either awaiting classification or as ongoing studies. In this review we included the remaining 761 publications (69 in non-English languages) describing 185 randomised clinical trials and 243 non-randomised studies (fig 1). When information to assess eligibility or bias was missing or data were missing or unclear we contacted the authors of the studies. Authors of 161 trials were contacted up to two times and answers were received for 92 trials.

Fig 1 Flow of studies through review

Of the 185 randomised clinical trials, 38 were parallel group (n = 5111 participants) and 147 were crossover (n = 7134 participants) trials, with a total of 12 245 participants. Participants of both sexes were included. Participants were aged between 3 and 18 years, but two trials included a small number of participants aged 19 to 21 years. The mean age was 9.7 years. The majority of these trials were conducted in high income countries. The median duration of treatment in the parallel group trials was 49 days (range 1–425 days, mean 75 days) and in the crossover trials was 14 days (1–56 days, mean 16 days). No parallel group trials and only six crossover trials (3.2%, 285 participants) seemed to have low risk of bias in all domains, and accordingly 179 (96.8%) trials were considered high risk of bias trials. By using GRADE, we rated the quality of evidence as being very low for all outcomes.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (UK and Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (Abstracts and International), and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform (including) from database inception up to April 7, 2017, with no restrictions by language, for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We used the search terms: "adhd" OR "hkd" OR "addh" OR "hyperkine" OR "attention deficit" OR "hyper-activ" OR "hyperactiv" OR "overactive" OR "inattentive" OR "impulsiv", combined with a list of ADHD medications (appendix pp 3–15). We also hand-searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and relevant drug manufacturers, and references of previous systematic reviews and guidelines, for additional information. Further, we contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to gather unpublished information or data. Over the past few decades, a substantial increase has been noted across many countries in prescription of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the benefits and safety of these medications remain a matter for debate. Published meta-analyses of head-to-head trials and network meta-analyses provide inconsistent findings on the comparative benefits and harms of ADHD medications.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^e04200f6]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) chronic care management — KAS 4 states that ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5), and this is a Grade B: strong recommendation. The rationale provided is that for many individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative.

### The epidemiology of pharmacologically treated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults in UK primary care [^10d55fb4]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by the symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. The prevalence of ADHD in school-aged children and adolescents in the United Kingdom (UK) using the broader Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria is estimated at 5%. The prevalence of hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) in children and young people (5–16 years), defined by the narrower International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria is estimated at 1.5%.

ADHD/HKD affects children and adolescents in various ways and to different extents; however the consequences of the condition generally impact greatly on patients, their families and those around them. Untreated ADHD/HKD is frequently associated with underachievement in school, harm to relationships with family, teachers and friends, increased rates of criminality and accidents; and the development of comorbid psychiatric symptoms including oppositionality, anxiety, depression and substance misuse.

Treatments and interventions for ADHD/HKD are varied and include in the main, psychological therapies and pharmacological treatment. When drug treatment is considered appropriate for the patient, the central nervous system stimulants methylphenidate (MPH) and dexamfetamine (DEX) and the non-stimulant atomoxetine (ATM) are recommended in the UK. These drug treatments have been shown to improve the core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Methylphenidate, considered to be first-line therapy, has been used for over 50 years for the treatment of ADHD/HKD and is licensed in the UK for use as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for ADHD/HKD in children (over 6 years of age) and adolescents when remedial measures alone prove insufficient.

Only one previous study known to us has estimated incidence rates and the prevalence for pharmacologically treated ADHD in boys aged 5–14 years in the UK from 1996–2001. This study reported a prevalence of 5.3 per 1000 boys in 1999.

### Clinical practice pathways for evaluation and medication choice for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptoms in autism spectrum disorders [^46558812]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention (referred to as "ADHD [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder] symptoms") occur in 41% to 78% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). These symptoms often affect quality of life, interfering with learning or interventions that target primary ASD symptoms. This practice pathway describes the guidelines for evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid ADHD symptoms.

Methods

Current research in this area is limited, and, therefore, these recommendations are based on a systematic literature review and expert consensus in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network Psychopharmacology Committee.

Results

The recommended practice pathway includes the Symptom Evaluation Pathway for systematic assessment of ADHD symptoms across settings; examination for comorbid sleep, medical, or psychiatric comorbidities that may contribute to symptoms; and evaluation of behavioral interventions that may ameliorate these symptoms. For children for whom medication is being considered to target the ADHD symptoms, the medication choice pathway provides guidance on the selection of the appropriate agent based on a review of available research, assessment of specific advantages and disadvantages of each agent, and dosing considerations.

Conclusions

These recommendations provide a framework for primary care providers treating children who have ASD and ADHD symptoms. Our systematic review of the current evidence indicates the need for more randomized controlled trials of the medications for ADHD symptoms in ASD. There will also be a need for studies of the effectiveness of these practice pathways in the future.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^678b11ae]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ADHD medication efficacy and age-specific considerations indicate that preschool-aged children may experience increased mood lability and dysphoria with stimulant medications, and none of the nonstimulants have FDA approval for use in preschool-aged children. For elementary school–aged students, evidence is particularly strong for stimulants and is sufficient but less strong for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine; stimulant medications have an effect size of around 1.0, whereas among nonstimulants the effect sizes are around 0.7 for all 3 and are less robust than that of stimulants. An individual's response to methylphenidate and amphetamine is idiosyncratic, with approximately 40% responding to both and about 40% responding to only 1.

MTA long-term outcomes and chronic care implications — "By the 3-year (ie, 36-month) follow-up to the MTA interventions, there were no differences among the 4 groups (ie, optimal medications management, optimal behavioral management, a combination of medication and behavioral management, and community treatment)." The report states, "This equivalence in poststudy outcomes may, however, have been attributable to convergence in ongoing treatments received for the 4 groups." It adds, "After the initial 14-month intervention, the children no longer received the careful monthly monitoring provided by the study and went back to receiving care from their community providers; therefore, they all effectively received a level of ongoing care consistent with the 'community treatment' study arm of the study." Subsequent care varied: "After leaving the MTA trial, medications and doses varied for the children who had been in the optimal medication management or combined medication and behavioral management groups, and a number stopped taking ADHD medication," and "On the other hand, some children who had been in the optimal behavioral management group started taking medication after leaving the trial." The authors conclude, "The results further emphasize the need to treat ADHD as a chronic illness and provide continuity of care and, where possible, provide a medical home."

### Advancing the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology [^57476aed]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Medications are an important component of the multimodal management strategy for many mental health conditions in children and adolescents. Clinical psychopharmacology for children and adolescents is generally considered to have begun in 1937, when Charles Bradleyreported the serendipitous discovery of the beneficial effects of benzedrine, a stimulant, on symptoms that would now be considered under the diagnostic category of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since then, clinical child and adolescent psychopharmacology has evolved from an art into an evidence-based discipline, driven by the conduct and publication of numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. This body of research has significantly contributed to our understanding of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety/tolerability of medications used to treat mental health conditions in children and young people. However, uncertainties and unmet needs remain in the field.

Seven studies published in the BMJ Mental Health topic collection Advances in Clinical Psychopharmacology in Children and Young People help strengthen the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology. Collectively, these articles provide evidence that informs key steps in the psychopharmacological management of children and adolescents with mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions.

First, a study by Lyhmann et al explored a key question that arises after the diagnostic process: Should the patient be treated with a medication?, with a specific focus on ADHD comorbidity. The authors applied an advanced quasi-experimental method — instrumental variable analysis — which uses observational data to draw causal inferences. Analysing a sample of more than 8000 Norwegian children and adolescents with ADHD, they examined patients who were 'on the margin of treatment' — i.e. those whose condition was neither too severe (where most clinicians would prescribe treatment) nor too mild (where most would withhold treatment). This approach allowed them to assess the impact of treatment in the development of subsequent comorbidity in cases where the decision to medicate varied based on provider preference. Among women, ADHD medication nearly eliminated the incidence of reactive disorders over the first 2 years of follow-up. In men, medication significantly reduced the incidence of tic disorders in the first 3 years. However, no other substantial benefits, or harms, of treating those 'at the margin of treatment' were observed.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^3a53deed]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

We found significant statistical heterogeneity in the pairwise meta-analyses, and the study population in our review included participants with different previous exposures and responses to ADHD medications. These characteristics were quite evenly distributed across the included studies and across the different nodes in the network, therefore, even if they contributed to statistical heterogeneity, it is unlikely that they have implications in terms of clinical heterogeneity and affected the validity of our results. On the contrary, heterogeneity can be seen as increasing the external validity of our findings, because the patients seen in real-world clinical practice tend to have similar variations. Although we included studies that used different rating scales to assess the core symptoms of ADHD, we selected carefully only validated scales that measure exclusively the same triad of symptoms — ie, inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Our results should also consider the risk of bias of individual studies and GRADE quality ratings. After gathering additional unpublished information, the overall number of unclear items — across all items of the risk of bias — decreased from 63·5% to 35·2%. This reduction points to an urgent need for complete and open reporting in this research area. Additionally, the confidence of estimate for primary outcomes was low or very low in multiple comparisons, reducing the certainty of the findings. Most very low ratings were for indirect comparisons, suggesting the need for additional well designed head-to-head studies. Whereas previous pairwise, or network meta-analysesof ADHD medications rated all comparisons as low or very low quality, attributable in part to unpublished information that we gathered and a more nuanced assessment, we could rate some comparisons as high or moderate quality. Of note, these comparisons included the most commonly used drugs for ADHD (ie, methylphenidate and amphetamines). Additionally, our stringent criteria for the risk of bias (ie, a study was assessed at overall low risk only when all individual items were at low risk) could have contributed to downgrade the final GRADE ratings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^f2b6777a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### ADHD diagnosis and treatment guidelines: a historical perspective [^d44dc81d]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral condition and the second most common chronic illness in children. The observance of specific behaviors in multiple settings have remained the most successful method for diagnosing the condition, and although there are differences in specific areas of the brain, and a high heritability estimate (∼76%), they are not diagnostically specific. Medications, and particularly stimulant medication, have undergone rigorous studies to document their efficacy dating back to the 1970s. Likewise, behavioral interventions in the form of parent training and classroom programs have demonstrated robust efficacy during the same time period. Both medication and behavioral interventions are symptomatic treatments. The availability of only symptomatic treatments places ADHD in the same category as other chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Successful treatment of most individuals requires ongoing adherence to the therapy. Improved communication between patients and their families, primary and mental health providers, and school personnel is necessary for effective ADHD treatment. Further enhancement of electronic systems to facilitate family, school, and provider communication can improve monitoring of ADHD symptoms and functional performance. The American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guidelines were initially developed to help primary care clinicians address the needs of their patients with ADHD and were further refined with the second revision in 2019.

Results

The literature search, study selection, and data extraction were done between Jan 11, 2014, and Sept 9, 2017, and data analysis was done from Sept 10, 2017, to Feb 24, 2018. The study selection process is shown in figure 1; a list of excluded studies, with reasons for exclusion, and a list of retained studies is provided in the appendix (pp 26–272). 133 studies were retained for the network meta-analysis, 81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one including children, adolescents, and adults. In total, 14 346 children and adolescents and 10 296 adults were included. For 83% of studies, additional data and information not reported in the full-text paper were used. The appendix (pp 283–381) reports the main characteristics of included studies. The risk of bias was rated overall low in 23·5% of studies in children and adolescents, unclear in 65·4%, and high in 11·1%. The risk of bias was overall low in 27·5% of studies in adults, unclear in 56·8%, and high in 15·7% (appendix pp 382–458).
