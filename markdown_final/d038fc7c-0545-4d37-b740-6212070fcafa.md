## Question

Postoperative wound infection management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postoperative wound infection management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining surgical site infection (SSI) and its classification and timing. Then, I should verify the initial assessment and diagnostic approach, including when to suspect infection and how to evaluate it. Next, I will review source control as the cornerstone of therapy, followed by indications and selection of antibiotics. After that, I should examine wound care and dressings, including the role of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). I will then consider special populations and procedure-specific nuances, integrate prevention bundles, and finally outline monitoring, follow-up, and antimicrobial stewardship, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on an imprecise concept. SSI is an infection related to the surgical procedure occurring within 30 days after the operation, or within 1 year if an implant is present, and it is categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space by CDC criteria, which frames both diagnostic thresholds and management urgency [^114wN9BA] [^112XpKn6].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of presentation because that influences pretest probability and empiric decisions. Early postoperative fever in the first 48 hours is unlikely to represent SSI, whereas after 48 hours SSI becomes a more common source of fever, and by postoperative day 4 fever is about equally likely to be due to SSI versus other causes; rare early SSIs within 48 hours are classically due to Streptococcus pyogenes or Clostridium species, which should prompt immediate concern and aggressive management if suspected [^116Jp3d7] [^112XpKn6].

> I need to check the clinical features that trigger suspicion so I don't overcall colonization as infection. Localized erythema, warmth, swelling, pain, and purulent drainage are key, with systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis supporting a systemic inflammatory response. In the first week, flat erythema without swelling or drainage often reflects local tissue irritation rather than bacterial infection, so I should avoid reflex antibiotics without objective infection features [^112XpKn6] [^114wN9BA].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic workup when infection is suspected. Opening the wound for inspection and drainage is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Obtaining cultures for Gram stain and culture before starting antibiotics improves targeted therapy and stewardship, and imaging such as ultrasound or CT is indicated when deep or organ/space infection is suspected, particularly for abscesses or device-related infections [^111jEtWA] [^111Lq8tE].

> Next, I will examine source control because antibiotics alone are insufficient without removing infected or devitalized material. The most important therapy for incisional SSI is prompt opening of the incision, evacuation of purulent material, debridement of necrotic tissue, and wound care allowing healing by secondary intention; in selected cases, percutaneous drainage or NPWT can be adjuncts, but open management remains foundational when infection is established [^111jEtWA] [^111jEtWA].

> Let me consider when antibiotics are actually indicated, and I should double-check the thresholds. Routine antibiotics are not required for superficial SSIs without systemic signs; a brief systemic course is indicated when there are systemic features such as temperature greater than 38.5°C, heart rate above 110 beats per minute, leukocytosis above 12,000/μL, or spreading erythema and induration beyond 5 cm from the wound edge, with selection tailored to the likely pathogens and procedure type [^111Lq8tE] [^113Etuia].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic choices by procedure and risk, and I need to ensure I align with expected flora. For clean procedures on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities, staphylococcal coverage is appropriate; for clean-contaminated or contaminated procedures involving the gastrointestinal, perineal, or female genital tract, coverage should include gram-negatives and anaerobes, with MRSA-active agents added when risk factors are present; definitive therapy should be narrowed to culture results and clinical response [^111Lq8tE] [^115R1LHt].

> But wait, what about duration and stewardship? I should confirm we avoid unnecessary exposure. Prolonged postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce SSI and may increase harm, so prophylaxis should be discontinued within 24 hours for most procedures and not continued beyond 48 hours even in special circumstances unless there is ongoing contamination or established infection requiring treatment; stewardship and audit-feedback improve adherence and outcomes [^1151PCTJ] [^113inFmM].

> Next, I should review wound care and dressings, and I need to be careful not to overstate benefits. Keep the initial postoperative dressing in place for at least 48 hours unless leakage occurs, and avoid routine use of advanced dressings for primarily closed wounds because high-quality evidence does not show superiority in preventing SSI; dressing selection should be based on cost, exudate management, and patient preference given the uncertainty of benefit [^114cbvjb] [^112Y3mJQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about negative pressure wound therapy. I should verify the strength and consistency of evidence. Multiple meta-analyses suggest that prophylactic NPWT on closed incisions probably reduces SSI compared with standard dressings, with the most pronounced benefit in high-risk populations such as obese patients and certain abdominal surgeries, though heterogeneity and device variability limit generalizability; NPWT should be considered selectively rather than used routinely [^112HAf25] [^113sivPe] [^111YYqAH].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and procedure-specific nuances. In colorectal surgery, implementing SSI bundles and considering NPWT in high-risk patients can reduce infections, whereas routine antimicrobial dressings are not recommended. In orthopedics, AAOS guidance supports individualized decisions with attention to implants and patient risk. In neurosurgery, device-related infections often require hardware removal plus organism-directed therapy. In trauma, open fractures require early debridement and stabilization with appropriately timed antibiotics, and prolonged postoperative prophylaxis is not beneficial [^113kuBsX] [^113J7ax2] [^113SVmbf] [^113khRsF].

> Let me reconsider prevention bundles because they shape baseline risk and downstream management. WHO and CDC emphasize integrated perioperative bundles spanning preoperative optimization, intraoperative technique, and postoperative care, including glycemic control, normothermia, oxygenation, hand hygiene, and standardized dressing protocols; embedding these into local workflows and checklists improves adherence and outcomes [^113UgEif] [^1148at6x].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up practices so we detect complications early. Routine surveillance for SSI should extend 30 days postoperatively, or 1 year if an implant is present, with structured patient education on signs of infection and clear return precautions; audit-and-feedback programs for antibiotic use and SSI rates, coupled with direct observation of wound care and hand hygiene, close the loop on quality improvement [^111Lq8tE] [^113inFmM].

> Finally, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is explicit, because overtreatment worsens resistance without helping patients. Avoid antibiotics for sterile inflammation, limit prophylaxis to guideline-recommended durations, and tailor therapy to cultures and clinical response; surveillance with feedback to clinicians reduces unnecessary postoperative antibiotic exposure and supports sustainable infection control practices [^113inFmM] [^117Aic4n].

Postoperative wound infection management centers on **early recognition** and **prompt source control** [^117J1ch9]. Open the wound, drain pus, and debride necrotic tissue [^111jEtWA]; obtain cultures to guide therapy [^111jEtWA]. Start **empiric antibiotics** for systemic signs or high-risk sites, then narrow to culture results [^115R1LHt]. Use standard dressings and keep them undisturbed for ≥ 48 hours unless leaking [^114cbvjb]; consider NPWT for high-risk wounds [^1161DBKU]. Monitor for clinical improvement and complications, and provide patient education on wound care and red flags [^113SVmbf].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

SSIs present with **localized erythema, warmth, swelling, pain, and purulent discharge** [^114wN9BA]; systemic signs (fever, chills, leukocytosis) may occur in more severe infections [^113Etuia]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by wound culture and, when indicated, imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) to assess deep or organ/space involvement [^114gNKNn].

---

## Initial assessment and risk stratification

Assess patient-specific risk factors — obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, smoking, and malnutrition — and procedure-specific factors — contamination level, duration, and type of surgery [^1159B5ML] [^114wN9BA]. Use **CDC criteria** to classify SSIs as superficial, deep, or organ/space [^112XpKn6].

---

## Source control: cornerstone of management

Source control is the **most critical step** [^117J1ch9]; delay increases morbidity and mortality [^111jEtWA]. Perform incision and drainage with removal of sutures or staples, evacuation of purulent material, and debridement of necrotic tissue [^1134cfnd]. Obtain **wound cultures** to guide targeted antibiotic therapy [^111jEtWA].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Start antibiotics when any of the following are present:

- Systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criteria [^114gNKNn].
- Signs of organ dysfunction (hypotension, oliguria, altered mental status) [^114gNKNn].
- Immunocompromised patients [^114gNKNn].
- Deep or organ/space infections [^notfound].

---

### Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric therapy should cover likely pathogens based on surgical site and patient risk factors:

| **Surgical site** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Clean (skin, soft tissue) | - Cefazolin <br/> - Or vancomycin if MRSA risk [^111Lq8tE] |
| Clean-contaminated (GI, GU) | - Piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Or cefuroxime + metronidazole [^115R1LHt] |
| Contaminated/dirty | Broad-spectrum coverage including Gram-negatives and anaerobes (e.g. carbapenem) [^111Lq8tE] |

---

Adjust antibiotics to **culture and sensitivity results** and continue for 7–14 days, depending on clinical response and severity [^111jEtWA].

---

## Wound care and dressings

- **Standard dressings**: Keep dressings undisturbed for ≥ 48 hours unless leaking [^114cbvjb].
- **Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)**: Consider for high-risk wounds (obesity, diabetes, contaminated surgery) to reduce SSI risk [^112HAf25] [^111YYqAH].
- **Advanced dressings**: Silver-containing or antimicrobial dressings may be considered for high-risk wounds, though evidence is limited [^112Y3mJQ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **clinical improvement** — reduced erythema, swelling, pain, and purulent discharge — and watch for complications such as dehiscence, abscess formation, or systemic infection [^114wN9BA]. Provide patient education on wound care, signs of infection, and when to seek medical attention [^1131K9Xi].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Perioperative antibiotics**: Administer within 60 minutes before incision; discontinue within 24 hours postoperatively [^111LBRCk].
- **Infection control**: Strict adherence to aseptic technique, hand hygiene, and sterile draping [^114MaF5d].
- **Patient optimization**: Control diabetes, optimize nutrition, smoking cessation, and weight management [^114YuKjc].

---

## Complications and outcomes

SSIs can lead to prolonged hospital stay, increased healthcare costs, and higher mortality [^114wN9BA]. Early recognition and appropriate management significantly **improve outcomes** [^112Q7tvD].

---

Postoperative wound infection management requires **early recognition**, prompt source control, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and meticulous wound care. Prevention strategies and patient education are essential to reduce incidence and improve outcomes [^114wN9BA].

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### Dressings for the prevention of surgical site infection [^112Y3mJQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical wounds (incisions) heal by primary intention when the wound edges are brought together and secured, often with sutures, staples, or clips. Wound dressings applied after wound closure may provide physical support, protection and absorb exudate. There are many different types of wound dressings available and wounds can also be left uncovered (exposed). Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of wounds and this may be associated with using (or not using) dressings, or different types of dressing.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wound dressings compared with no wound dressings, and the effects of alternative wound dressings, in preventing SSIs in surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register (searched 19 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and Epub Ahead of Print; 1946 to 19 September 2016); Ovid Embase (1974 to 19 September 2016); EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1937 to 19 September 2016). There were no restrictions based on language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound dressings with wound exposure (no dressing) or alternative wound dressings for the postoperative management of surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction independently.

Main Results

We included 29 trials (5718 participants). All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification, five trials that included people undergoing what was considered 'clean/contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Four trials compared wound dressings with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining 25 studies compared alternative dressing types, with the majority comparing a basic wound contact dressing with film dressings, silver dressings or hydrocolloid dressings. The review contains 11 comparisons in total.

Primary Outcome

SSIIt is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision. We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below:- film dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.55), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.78), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.51), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.62), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.37), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Secondary outcomesThere was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing and ease of removal, and uncertainty whether wound dressings influenced these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^115gHhqB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative wound complications are common following surgical procedures. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether NPWT reduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of NPWT compared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions.

Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients. NPWT was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95 per cent c.i. 0.33 to 0.89) and seroma formation (RR 0.48, 0.27 to 0.84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence.

Conclusion

Compared with standard postoperative dressings, NPWT significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds. Heterogeneity between the included studies means that no general recommendations can be made yet.

### Delphi prioritization and development of global surgery guidelines for the prevention of surgical-site infection [^116YVfar]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

SSI is the commonest postoperative complication in abdominal surgery 12, 13, 14. Initiatives to reduce it should be prioritized worldwide, but the need is greatest in LMICs, where up to one‐quarter of patients develop an SSI after gastrointestinal surgery 13. Antimicrobial resistance is significantly more common in LMICs than HICs 13, 15. The current guideline offers a potential pathway to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the high healthcare costs incurred by SSI 16, in particular by providing clear guidance regarding the selection, timing and route of administration of prophylactic antibiotics. This guideline implements research findings which may reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure at a population level, for example by reducing the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis 17, 18. This will support antibiotic stewardship initiatives aimed at curbing antimicrobial resistance.

The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist has been disseminated widely, and has been demonstrated to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality 19, 20, 21. Some health systems have embedded an SSI bundle in local versions of the checklist to ensure that all patients receive key interventions to reduce infection risk. Surgical colleges and associations should work with healthcare providers to produce local Surgical Safety Checklists that incorporate this guideline's key recommendations. Given that the checklist is used in only half of emergency abdominal procedures in middle‐income countries and a third of procedures in low‐income countries 22, implementation of these guidelines should be performed alongside broader initiatives to increase uptake of the checklist 23. There remain significant evidence gaps in the prevention of SSI, highlighted by the four research recommendations made in this guideline. In order to inform policy in LMICs, it is essential that future trials incorporate health economic evaluation 24.

### Diagnosis and management of complications from the treatment of primary central nervous system tumors in adults [^113SVmbf]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Infections

Postoperative infections can be categorized as superficial wound infection, bone flap infection, intra-parenchymal abscess, meningitis, and ventriculitis. The overall postoperative infection rate in glioma surgery is 0.5%–5%, and recognized risk factors include diabetes, corticosteroids, and smoking. The risk of infection is not increased by the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid, ultrasound, awake surgery, or electrophysiology monitoring in patients operated for brain tumors. Despite anecdotal evidence, postoperative bacterial infection does not confer a survival benefit in glioblastoma.

Bundles of care are often implemented to reduce infection rates, for example, pre- and postoperative medicated hair wash, use of combined chlorhexidine and betadine skin preparation and administration of perioperative antibiotics. Definitive evidence to support their use remains conflicting and surgeon and hospital variation exist in practice. As a minimum, perioperative antibiotics, careful skin preparation, and meticulous attention to aseptic technique by the surgical team are recommended.

Bone flap infections should be managed with bone flap removal and appropriate intravenous antibiotics according to microbiology culture results. If a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or an intraventricular access device for intrathecal chemotherapy becomes infected, this should be managed with surgical removal of the hardware and appropriate intravenous antibiotics according to microbiology culture results. Appropriate aseptic technique and experienced teams are recommended for the management of such devices.

Hydrocephalus

Postoperative hydrocephalus affects up to 7% of patients undergoing glioma resectionand 2.1% of the patients after posterior fossa surgery. Acute hydrocephalus should be managed with emergency external ventricular drain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to ensure there is not coexisting infection. Once CSF is confirmed as sterile and there is confirmed persistent hydrocephalus clinically and on imaging, patients should undergo insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduces the risk of shunt infection to ~2%. Valve choice is at the discretion of the surgeon.

Main Expert Recommendations

Brain tumor surgery should be performed in specialized centers.
Risk factors for infection, ischemia, and bleeding should be identified and considered prior to surgery.
DWI sequences should be included in the postoperative MRI obtained within 24–72 hours after surgery.
Postoperative infections require vigorous treatment per se to avoid delays of further oncological therapies.
Patients and caregivers should be informed about wound care and symptoms and signs potentially associated with complications.
Radiotherapy and systemic antitumor therapy should not be started unless the patient has recovered from postoperative complications and is in a stable condition.
The indication for neurorehabilitation should be routinely assessed after brain tumor surgery.

### Surgical site infection risk factors and risk stratification [^116Ns2c7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Preoperative identification of the risk factors for surgical site infection and patient risk stratification are essential for deciding whether surgery is appropriate, educating patients on their individual risk of complications, and managing postoperative expectations. Early identification of these factors is also necessary to help guide both patient medical optimization and perioperative care planning. Several resources are currently available to track and analyze healthcare-associated infections, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons are exploring collaborative opportunities for the codevelopment of a hip and/or knee arthroplasty national quality measure for periprosthetic joint infection.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^112C4ETA]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline on prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) after major extremity trauma — PICO questions define the literature search by focusing on patients undergoing surgery and address antibiotic timing for open fractures, pre-, peri-, and post-operative prophylactic antibiotics, timing of surgery post-injury, pre-operative skin preparations, initial wound management strategy, wound closure management strategies for closed and open injuries, and perioperative modifiable and administrative risk factors that affect SSI rates.

### Management of surgical site infections [^113Pn2w9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has developed Appropriate Use Criteria for the Management of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) (website: http://www.orthoguidelines.org/go/auc/default.cfm?auc_id = 225018&actionxm = Terms). Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The Appropriate Use Criteria for the Management of SSIs were derived by identifying clinical indications typical of patients commonly presenting with a SSI in clinical practice. These indications were most often parameters observable by the clinician, including symptoms and diagnostic tests. The 264 patient scenarios and nine treatments were developed by the writing panel, which consisted of a group of clinicians who are specialists in this Appropriate Use Criteria topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a nine-point scale to designate a treatment as appropriate (median rating, seven to nine), may be appropriate (median rating, four to six), or rarely appropriate (median rating, one to three).

### Current concepts in debridement: science and strategies [^115qMaxA]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The establishment of a healthy wound bed through adequate debridement of infected, senescent, and/or devitalized tissue is central to the progression of normal wound healing. Although a variety of surgical and nonsurgical strategies have been proposed, none have proven completely effective in all settings. This review focuses on the principles and techniques of modern debridement practices employed in the management of complex wounds.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the PubMed/Medline and Ovid databases was performed to identify basic science and clinical studies using key words most relevant to biofilm, debridement, and wound healing. English language articles that were peer reviewed and that met the standard of evidence-based medicine were included. Level of evidence for various debridement approaches was rated utilizing the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Rating Levels of Evidence and Grading Recommendations.

Results

The value of both operative and nonoperative debridement techniques, their indications, and limitations are described. With an emphasis placed on surgical debridement, this review highlights technical adjuncts that can be used to optimize wound bed preparation, including preoperative topical staining of the wound, as well as the use of color-guided endpoints to prevent removal of excess healthy tissue. The indications for using temporizing measures for wound control such as negative pressure wound therapy with and without installation are also discussed.

Conclusion

Optimal management requires a multimodal approach that centers around operative debridement and incorporates the use of adjunctive measures to facilitate the removal of infected tissue, biofilm, and/or senescent cells that impede the progression of normal wound healing.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^113sivPe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs). Existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by primary closure remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing through primary closure, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of NPWT in wounds healing through primary closure.

Search Methods

In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they allocated participants to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology.

Main Results

In this third update, we added 15 new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three new economic studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (7447 included participants) and five economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in the context of a wide range of surgeries including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular and general procedures. Economic studies assessed NPWT in orthopaedic, obstetric and general surgical settings. All studies compared NPWT with standard dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain. Primary outcomes Four studies (2107 participants) reported mortality. There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT (2.3%) compared with standard dressings (2.7%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.47; I² = 0%). Thirty-nine studies reported SSI; 31 of these (6204 participants), were included in meta-analysis. There is moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) that NPWT probably results in fewer SSI (8.8% of participants) than treatment with standard dressings (13.0% of participants) after surgery; RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.80; I² = 23%). Eighteen studies reported dehiscence; 14 of these (3809 participants) were included in meta-analysis. There is low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of dehiscence after surgery for NPWT (5.3% of participants) compared with standard dressings (6.2% of participants) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; I² = 0%). Secondary outcomes There is low-certainty evidence showing no clear difference between NPWT and standard treatment for the outcomes of reoperation and incidence of seroma. For reoperation, the RR was 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; I² = 13%; 12 trials; 3523 participants); for seroma, the RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.05; I² = 0%; seven trials; 729 participants). The effect of NPWT on occurrence of haematoma or skin blisters is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence); for haematoma, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.59; I² = 0%; nine trials; 1202 participants) and for blisters the RR was 2.64 (95% CI 0.65 to 10.68; I² = 69%; seven trials; 796 participants). The overall effect of NPWT on pain is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence from seven trials (2218 participants) which reported disparate measures of pain); but moderate-certainty evidence suggests there is probably little difference between the groups in pain after three or six months following surgery for lower limb fracture (one trial, 1549 participants). There is also moderate-certainty evidence for women undergoing caesarean sections (one trial, 876 participants) and people having surgery for lower limb fractures (one trial, 1549 participants) that there is probably little difference in quality of life scores at 30 days or 3 or 6 months, respectively. Cost-effectiveness Five economic studies, based wholly or partially on trials included in our review, assessed the cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT in four indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They calculated quality-adjusted life-years for treatment groups and produced estimates of the treatments' relative cost-effectiveness. The reporting quality was good but the grade of the evidence varied from moderate to very low. There is moderate-certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was not cost-effective at any threshold of willingness-to-pay and that NPWT is probably cost-effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other studies found low or very low-certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be cost-effective for the indications assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

People experiencing primary wound closure of their surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably experience fewer SSI than people treated with standard dressings (moderate-certainty evidence). There is no clear difference in number of deaths or wound dehiscence between people treated with NPWT and standard dressings (low-certainty evidence). There are also no clear differences in secondary outcomes where all evidence was low or very low-certainty. In caesarean section in obese women and surgery for lower limb fracture, there is probably little difference in quality of life scores (moderate-certainty evidence). Most evidence on pain is very low-certainty, but there is probably no difference in pain between NPWT and standard dressings after surgery for lower limb fracture (moderate-certainty evidence). Assessments of cost-effectiveness of NPWT produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.

### Wound care practices after orthopaedic trauma surgery are highly variable and not evidence based [^116TYsL6]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Given the tremendous medical, social and financial costs of surgical site infections, the pressure to minimize these complications has been mounting. There remains a substantial gap in evidence-based practice for postoperative wound care after orthopaedic trauma surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine what standards are currently in practice for postoperative wound management.

Methods

A 16-question web-based survey was published on the Orthopaedic Trauma Association website and disseminated to members through the association's quarterly email. The survey gathered data on postoperative wound care practices; specifically, when wound checks are performed, and when providers allow patients to get the incisions wet.

Results

102 Orthopaedic surgeons completed the survey. Ninety-one percent were trauma fellowship trained, and 95% worked at either a Level I (76%) or Level II (19%) trauma center. There were over 100 different proposed protocols captured by the survey. The majority of surgeons (54%) perform a wound check within the first three days after surgery. Additionally, half of surgeons (50%) do not permit patients to get their incisions wet until sutures and staples are removed.

Conclusion

Wound care routines following surgical management of orthopaedic trauma injuries are highly variable. Diverse protocols are performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon without scientific basis. This study defines immense variability in one aspect of peri-operative care that could play an important role in surgical site infections and provides a foundation for future studies to explore the potential influence of standardized wound care routines on post-operative infections and wound healing.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111jEtWA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

What is new in the prevention of SSIs? What are the principles of SSI prevention?

Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as antimicrobial resistance action plans. We recommend that all healthcare workers adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are the most common healthcare-associated infections among surgical patients. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays.

SSIs are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not-direct costs worldwide. Despite progress in prevention knowledge, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice.

The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

The proposed recommendations are as follows:
"Strong" – Expert panel was confident that benefits outweighed risks, considered to be adaptable for implementation in most (if not all) situations, and patients should receive intervention as course of action.
"Conditional" – Expert panel considered that benefits of intervention probably outweighed the risks; a more structured decision-making process should be undertaken, based on stakeholder consultation and involvement of patients and healthcare professionals.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111UqoD2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Many risk factors are beyond practitioner control, but optimizing perioperative conditions can certainly help decrease infection risk. High-risk surgical patients may be identified on the basis of individual risk factors or combinations of factors. In particular, statistical models and risk calculators may be useful in predicting infectious risks, both in general and for SSIs. These models differ in the number of variables: inclusion of preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative variables; ease of calculation; and specificity for particular procedures. Furthermore, the models differ in their accuracy in stratifying risk.

Although multiple strategies exist for identifying surgical patients at high risk for SSIs, no strategy is superior for all patients, and further efforts are necessary to determine if the risk stratification in combination with risk modification can reduce SSIs in this patient population.

Early evaluation of perioperative SSI risk factors and patient risk stratification could be of great value in the development of predictive risk models. Predictive risk models could, in turn, assist surgeons and their patients in the clinical decision-making process (e.g. counseling patients on the appropriateness and risks of surgery). In addition, risk models could be used to develop targeted perioperative prevention strategies and diagnostic care process models and improve risk adjustment for risk modeling used in the public reporting of SSI as a quality metric.

However, a study reviewing SSIs in patients undergoing colorectal resections (C-SSIs), identified from an institutional ACS-NSQIP dataset (2006 to 2014), showed that published risk prediction models do not accurately predict C-SSI in their own independent institutional dataset. Application of externally developed prediction models to any individual practice must be validated or modified to account for the institution and case-mix specific factors. This questions the validity of using externally or nationally developed models for "expected" outcomes and interhospital comparisons.

Question 19. How can you care post-operative wounds to prevent surgical site infections?

Statement 19.1. Advanced dressing of any type should not be used for primarily closed surgical wounds for the purpose of preventing SSI.

Statement 19.2. The surgical wound dressing can be removed for a minimum of 48 hours after surgery unless leakage occurs. There is no evidence that extending medication time implies a reduction in SSIs.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^117J1ch9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 16. Which are the principles of source control?

Statement 16.1. The timing and adequacy of source control are important in the management of surgical infections; late and/or incomplete procedures may have severely adverse consequences on outcome especially in critically ill patients.

Source control encompasses all measures undertaken to eliminate the source of infection, reduce the bacterial inoculum, and correct or control anatomic derangements to restore normal physiologic function.

As a general principle, every verified source of infection should be controlled as soon as possible. The level of urgency of treatment is determined by the affected organs, the relative speed at which clinical symptoms progress and worsen, and the underlying physiological stability of the patient. Non-operative interventional procedures include percutaneous drainages of abscesses. Ultrasound- and CT-guided percutaneous drainage of abdominal and extraperitoneal abscesses in selected patients are safe and effective. The principal cause for failure of percutaneous drainage is misdiagnosis of the magnitude, extent, complexity, and location of the abscess.

Surgery is the most important therapeutic measure to control surgical infections. In the setting of intra-abdominal infections, the primary objectives of surgical intervention include determining the cause of peritonitis, draining fluid collections, and controlling the origin of the abdominal sepsis. In patients with intra-abdominal infections, surgical source control entails resection or suture of a diseased or perforated viscus (e.g. diverticular perforation, gastro-duodenal perforation), removal of the infected organ (e.g. appendix, gallbladder), debridement of necrotic tissue, resection of ischemic bowel, and repair/resection of traumatic perforations with primary anastomosis or exteriorization of the bowel.

In certain circumstances, infection not completely controlled may trigger an excessive immune response and local infection may progressively evolve into sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure. Such patients can benefit from immediate and aggressive surgical re-operations with subsequent re-laparotomy strategies, to curb the spread of organ dysfunctions caused by ongoing peritonitis. Surgical strategies following an initial emergency laparotomy include subsequent "re-laparotomy on demand" (when required by the patient's clinical condition) as well as planned re-laparotomy in the 36–48h postoperative period.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of wound dressings in the prevention of surgical-site infections in surgical wounds healing by primary intention [^115kiUCX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative surgical-site infections are a major source of morbidity and cost. This study aimed to identify and present all randomized controlled trial evidence evaluating the effects of dressings on surgical-site infection rates in surgical wounds healing by primary intention; the secondary outcomes included comparisons of pain, scar and acceptability between dressings.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing alternative wound dressings, or wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed for postoperative management of surgical wounds were included in the review regardless of their language. Databases searched included the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register and Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL from inception to May 2011. Two authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction, including an assessment of surgical contamination according to the surgical procedure. Where levels of clinical and statistical heterogeneity permitted, data were pooled for meta-analysis.

Results

Sixteen controlled trials with 2594 participants examining a range of wound contamination levels were included. They were all unclear or at high risk of bias. There was no evidence that any dressing significantly reduced surgical-site infection rates compared with any other dressing or leaving the wound exposed. Furthermore, no significant differences in pain, scarring or acceptability were seen between the dressings.

Conclusion

No difference in surgical-site infection rates was demonstrated between surgical wounds covered with different dressings and those left uncovered. No difference was seen in pain, scar or acceptability between dressings.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^113Ruo9P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs). While existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT remains uncertain, new trials necessitated an updated review of the evidence for the effects of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by primary closure.

Objectives

To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy for preventing surgical site infection in wounds healing through primary closure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus in February 2018. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and checked reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions on language, publication date, or setting.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they allocated participants to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors independently assessed trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment according to GRADE methodology.

Main Results

In this second update we added 25 intervention trials, resulting in a total of 30 intervention trials (2957 participants), and two economic studies nested in trials. Surgeries included abdominal and colorectal (n = 5); caesarean section (n = 5); knee or hip arthroplasties (n = 5); groin surgery (n = 5); fractures (n = 5); laparotomy (n = 1); vascular surgery (n = 1); sternotomy (n = 1); breast reduction mammoplasty (n = 1); and mixed (n = 1). In three key domains four studies were at low risk of bias; six studies were at high risk of bias; and 20 studies were at unclear risk of bias. We judged the evidence to be of low or very low certainty for all outcomes, downgrading the level of the evidence on the basis of risk of bias and imprecision. Primary outcomesThree studies reported mortality (416 participants; follow-up 30 to 90 days or unspecified). It is uncertain whether NPWT has an impact on risk of death compared with standard dressings (risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.56; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias and twice for very serious imprecision). Twenty-five studies reported on SSI. The evidence from 23 studies (2533 participants; 2547 wounds; follow-up 30 days to 12 months or unspecified) showed that NPWT may reduce the rate of SSIs (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85; low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious risk of bias). Fourteen studies reported dehiscence. We combined results from 12 studies (1507 wounds; 1475 participants; follow-up 30 days to an average of 113 days or unspecified) that compared NPWT with standard dressings. It is uncertain whether NPWT reduces the risk of wound dehiscence compared with standard dressings (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.18; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious risk of bias and once for serious imprecision). Secondary outcomesWe are uncertain whether NPWT increases or decreases reoperation rates when compared with a standard dressing (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.63; 6 trials; 1021 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision) or if there is any clinical benefit associated with NPWT for reducing wound-related readmission to hospital within 30 days (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.57; 7 studies; 1271 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision). It is also uncertain whether NPWT reduces incidence of seroma compared with standard dressings (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; 6 studies; 568 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious risk of bias and once for serious imprecision). It is uncertain if NPWT reduces or increases the risk of haematoma when compared with a standard dressing (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.42; 6 trials; 831 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious risk of bias and twice for very serious imprecision. It is uncertain if there is a higher risk of developing blisters when NPWT is compared with a standard dressing (RR 6.64, 95% CI 3.16 to 13.95; 6 studies; 597 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious risk of bias and twice for very serious imprecision). Quality of life was not reported separately by group but was used in two economic evaluations to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). There was no clear difference in incremental QALYs for NPWT relative to standard dressing when results from the two trials were combined (mean difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.00; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial concluded that NPWT may be more cost-effective than standard care, estimating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value of GBP 20.65 per QALY gained. A second cost-effectiveness study estimated that when compared with standard dressings NPWT was cost saving and improved QALYs. We rated the overall quality of the reports as very good; we did not grade the evidence beyond this as it was based on modelling assumptions.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the addition of 25 trials, results are consistent with our earlier review, with the evidence judged to be of low or very low certainty for all outcomes. Consequently, uncertainty remains about whether NPWT compared with a standard dressing reduces or increases the incidence of important outcomes such as mortality, dehiscence, seroma, or if it increases costs. Given the cost and widespread use of NPWT for SSI prophylaxis, there is an urgent need for larger, well-designed and well-conducted trials to evaluate the effects of newer NPWT products designed for use on clean, closed surgical incisions. Such trials should initially focus on wounds that may be difficult to heal, such as sternal wounds or incisions on obese patients.

### Assessment of risk factors associated with surgical site infection following abdominal surgery: a systematic review [^114X22bM]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no previous systematic reviews in the literature that studied the risk factors of SSIs following the different types of general abdominal surgeries in particular. Moreover, as a high level of evidence is greatly needed in the surgical literature, this systematic review comes to comprehensively identify and assess the current evidence of these predictive factors of postoperative wound infections after abdominal surgery as they have been published in the medical peer-reviewed literature, taking into consideration the potential confounders. We believe that the results of our study will add recent evidence that will help in improving surgical management by forming evidence-based strategies to decrease the rates of preventable SSIs by targeting their potential risk factors; one can improve patient safety.

Additional approaches for preventing SSI

These additional approaches can be considered when hospitals have successfully implemented essential practices and seek to further improve outcomes in specific locations and/or patient populations.

Perform an SSI risk assessment. (Qualify of Evidence: LOW) Convene a multidisciplinary team (eg, surgical leadership, hospital administration, qualify management services, and infection control) to identify gaps, improve performance, measure compliance, assess impacts of interventions, and provide feedback.
Consider use of negative-pressure dressings in patients who may benefit. (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Negative-pressure dressings placed over closed incisions are thought to work by reducing fluid accumulation in the wound. Recent systematic reviews have demonstrated a significant reduction in SSI with their use. - These dressings have been particularly noted to reduce SSIs in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery, and joint arthroplasty, although not all studies have shown benefitand some indicate benefit only in a subset of procedures such as revision arthroplasty. Guidance is lacking regarding which patients most benefit from the use of negative-pres sure dressings, with some evidence that the benefit increases with age and body mass index. Negative-pressure dressings seem most successful at reducing superficial SSIs, but some risk of blistering has been observed. These blisters could lead to breaks in the skin that might increase risk of infection. It is important to assess the ability of the patient to manage a negative-pressure dressing, particularly if used in the ambulatory setting. Cost-effectiveness studies of negative-pressure dressings are needed.
Observe and review practices in the preoperative clinic, postanesthesia care unit, surgical intensive care unit, and/or surgical ward. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Perform direct observation audits of hand-hygiene practices among all HCP with direct patient contact. Evaluate wound care practices. Perform direct observation audits of environmental cleaning practices. Provide feedback and review infection control measures with HCP in these perioperative care settings.
Use antiseptic-impregnated sutures as a strategy to prevent SSI. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Human volunteer studies involving foreign bodies have demonstrated that the presence of surgical sutures decreases the inoculum required to cause an SSI from 10⁶ to 10² organisms. Some trials have shown that surgical wound closure with triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 antimicrobial sutures may decrease the risk of SSI compared to standard sutures. For example, an RCT of 410 colorectal surgeries concluded that the rate of SSI decreased > 50% among patients who received antimicrobial sutures (9.3% in control group vs 4.3 among cases; p = 0.05). In contrast, a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 7 RCTs and concluded that neither SSI rates (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.4–1.51; p = 0.45) nor wound dehiscence rates (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.21–5.43; p = 0.93) were statistically different compared to controls. In addition, a small study raised concern about higher wound dehiscence rates associated with using these antimicrobial sutures. The impact of routinely using antiseptic-impregnated sutures on the development of antiseptic resistance remains unknown.

Alarming levels of AMR have been reported in all countries, regardless of their average income level. On the basis of predictive statistical models, Murray and collaborators estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1.27 million deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. The six leading bacterial pathogens associated with AMR were Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These bacteria were responsible for 929,000 deaths attributable to AMR and 3.57 million deaths associated with AMR in 2019.

Although antibiotic resistance is a widely recognized public health threat, less is known about the burden of antifungal resistance. The frequency of fungal infections has raised in recent years, largely because of the increasing size of the at-risk population, which includes patients with cancer, transplant recipients, immunocompromised patients such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and other patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, fungal infections are relatively common in critically ill patients and are associated with considerable morbidity and death. Recently, an insidious multidrug-resistant species, Candida auris, has emerged causing persistent multi-regional outbreaks.

Of significant importance in limiting AMR is efforts to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Patients with medical devices (central lines, urinary catheters, and ventilators) or who undergo surgical procedures are at high risk of acquiring HAIs. Prevention is better than cure, and every infection prevented is one that does not need treatment. Infection prevention and control can be cost-effective and implemented everywhere, even where resources are limited. HAIs result in significant morbidity and mortality, prolong the duration of hospital stay, and may necessitate additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Physicians in hospital settings should be aware of their role and responsibility in maintaining the effectiveness of current and future antibiotics. In Fig. 1, the fundamental principles for correct infection prevention and management across the surgical pathway are illustrated.

Question 11. Which are the principles of antibiotic prophylaxis?

Statement 11.1. Prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery is generally not associated with better clinical results.

Statement 11.2. There is no universally recognized intervention for improving the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery. These interventions must be tailored to the type of surgeon and team to which they are addressed.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to reduce the risk of SSIs across different types of surgical procedures.

Given the evidence, systemic PAP is considered to be a key component of perioperative infection prevention bundles. Although compliance with appropriate timing and spectrum of PAP has improved as a result of quality improvement initiatives, there remain significant deficiencies in compliance with other aspects of PAP such as duration of postoperative antibiotics. Given that approximately 15% of all antibiotics in hospitals are prescribed for surgical prophylaxis, perioperative antibiotic prescribing patterns can be a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile) and selection of antibiotic resistance, increasing healthcare costs.

Although appropriate PAP plays a pivotal role in reducing the rate of SSIs, other factors that impact SSI rates should not be ignored. PAP should never substitute for good medical practices, such as those of IPC. Perioperative SSI prevention strategies should include attention to basic IPC strategies, surgical technique, hospital and operating room environments, instrument sterilization processes, and perioperative optimization of patient risk factors.

The key elements of appropriate surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing include the correct antimicrobial indication, drug dose, route, the timing of administration, and duration.

Joint guidelines for PAP in surgery were revised and updated in 2013 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. These guidelines focus on the effective and safe use of AP. Therapeutic serum and tissue concentrations of antimicrobial agents should be present during the period of potential contamination. Additional antibiotic doses may need to be administered intraoperatively for prolonged procedures or for agents with short half-lives. In order to be safe, PAP should have no or few adverse effects and should have the narrowest spectrum of activity necessary to prevent postoperative infections.

### New WHO recommendations on preoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^114MaF5d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most preventable health-care-associated infections and are a substantial burden to health-care systems and service payers worldwide in terms of patient morbidity, mortality, and additional costs. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations of national guidelines have been identified. Given the burden of SSIs worldwide, the numerous gaps in evidence-based guidance, and the need for standardisation and a global approach, WHO decided to prioritise the development of evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSIs. The guidelines take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences. On the basis of systematic literature reviews and expert consensus, we present 13 recommendations on preoperative preventive measures.

### Dressings for the prevention of surgical site infection [^113QeH9m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical wounds (incisions) heal by primary intention when the wound edges are brought together and secured - often with sutures, staples, clips or glue. Wound dressings, usually applied after wound closure, provide physical support, protection from bacterial contamination and absorb exudate. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of surgical wounds that may delay healing.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wound dressings for preventing SSI in people with surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Search Methods

In February 2014 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); The Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing alternative wound dressings or wound dressing with no dressing (wound exposure) for the postoperative management of surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction independently.

Main Results

Twenty RCTs were included (3623 participants). All trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. Twelve trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a contamination classification of 'clean', two trials included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean/contaminated' contamination classification and the remaining trials evaluated people with wounds resulting from various surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Two trials compared wound dressings with leaving wounds exposed. The remaining 18 trials compared two alternative dressing types. No evidence was identified to suggest that any dressing significantly reduced the risk of developing an SSI compared with leaving wounds exposed or compared with alternative dressings in people who had surgical wounds healing by primary intention.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is insufficient evidence as to whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the rates of SSI, improving scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of dressing removal. Most trials in this review were small and at high or unclear risk of bias. However, based on the current evidence, we conclude that decisions on wound dressing should be based on dressing costs and the symptom management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.

### Management of acute wounds [^115d1aZg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The acute wound presents a spectrum of issues that prevent its ultimate closure. These issues include host factors, etiology, anatomic location, timing, and surgical techniques to achieve successful wound closure. Basic surgical principles need to be followed to obtain stable, long-term coverage, ultimately restoring form and function. Recent advances in dressings, debridement techniques, and surgical repertoire allow the modern plastic surgeon to address any wound of any complexity. This article discusses these principles that can be applied to any wound.

### Intracavity lavage and wound irrigation for prevention of surgical site infection [^113Lua8j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Surgical wound irrigation is an intraoperative surgical technique, which may reduce the rate of SSIs by the removal of debris (dead or damaged tissue), metabolic waste, and wound exudate. It aims to create the optimal environment for wound healing, and is used with variable uptake among surgical practitioners (Barnes 2014). The theoretical advantage of surgical wound irrigation is to reduce the bacterial load in a surgical or traumatic wound by a combination of water pressure, dilution, or the application of antimicrobial agents. Usually, irrigation is undertaken at the end of an operative procedure, prior to wound closure, however postoperative wound irrigation may also be applied.

Intracavity lavage is another intraoperative surgical technique, which utilises similar principles to surgical wound irrigation with the aim of reducing SSI risk. It can be adopted during any operation that exposes a bodily cavity, but is most commonly used for procedures on the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity and during joint replacement surgery. Both wound irrigation and intracavity lavage can be altered by three basic variables: volume of irrigation fluid; mechanism/timing of delivery; or solution composition. We use the terms 'irrigation' and 'lavage' separately in this review, however they do not necessarily describe distinctly separate surgical techniques, and may often refer to similar methods of washout for a cavity or a wound.

How the intervention might work

The aim of wound irrigation and lavage is to reduce the bacterial load in a surgical or traumatic wound by a combination of water pressure, dilution, or the application of antimicrobial agents. Usually, this is undertaken at the end of an operative procedure, prior to wound closure, to reduce the likelihood of the introduction of bacteria.

Both wound irrigation and intracavity lavage can be achieved using various solutions. Normal saline is commonly used along with antimicrobial agents for intracavity lavage. However, there is concern that antimicrobial agents may damage tissue and prevent normal healing. It is thought that the introduction of large volumes of fluid into a cavity or wound could wash away inflammatory cells vital to the host defence (Schultz 2011).

### Surgical site infections: an update [^114LcWDw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) lead to adverse patient outcomes, including prolonged hospitalization and death. Wound contamination occurs with each incision, but proven strategies exist to decrease the risk of SSI. In particular, improved adherence to evidence-based preventative measures related to appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis can decrease the rate of SSI. Aggressive surgical debridement and effective antimicrobial therapy are needed to optimize the treatment of SSI.

### Surgical site infections: current management and role of new antibiotics [^112Q7tvD]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Management of SSI comprises prevention, extensive diagnosis, and appropriate treatment as well as follow-up. All these are interrelated matters. This review gives a brief update on the latest developments in the field, specifically on new antibiotics that may find a place in this complex field.

Recent Findings

Avibactam and dalbavancin are novel antiinfectives. Although randomized controlled trials in SSI are lacking to date, preliminary data show that new drugs may be alternatives to existing treatment. Currently, they should be used only on the ground of susceptibility testing, and if standard drugs are inappropriate.

Summary

Correct diagnosis of SSI depends on the type of procedure performed. However, early detection is of great importance for proper management across all surgical interventions. The management of SSI includes consistent antibiotic therapy, wound drainage, and rigorous wound debridement as appropriate. Specific wound management thereafter depends on the location and nature of infection. If available, culture findings guide changes in antibiotic therapy. Avibactam and dalbavancin are novel antiinfectives that should be used on ground of susceptibility testing in the absence of appropriate alternatives. Follow-up is particularly important in patients with prosthesis in place. The most promising approach of postdischarge surveillance is a matter of ongoing debate.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^111LBRCk]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Tobacco Use

The use of tobacco can increase postoperative complications including impaired wound healing, augmented infection, and delayed and/or impaired arthrodesis. One systematic review and meta analysis study demonstrated a relative risk reduction of 41% for prevention of postoperative complications. Each week of cessation increased the magnitude of effect by 19%. Therefore, tobacco use should be avoided to decrease the incidence of postoperative complications.

Antibiotics

Antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) plays an important role in reducing surgical site infections, especially if patient-related risk factors for infection are present. Guidelines for implementing antibiotics for surgical procedures vary by type of surgery, surgical wound classification and patient risk factors and comorbidities. National quality improvement efforts have focused on reduction of surgical site infections and have developed initiatives for improved antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery. As mentioned earlier, the posterior SIJ fusion is considered a class 1, clean, non-contaminated surgical procedure, with less than 2% infection risk, as classified by the CDC. Antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing clean procedures is not well established and generally not recommended, however, there is stronger support and evidence for prophylactic antimicrobial treatment when implanted hardware or foreign materials are involved in orthopedic procedures, or spinal procedures with or without instrumentation or hardware. This is especially true for the intraoperative phase and administration of the prophylactic agent should start within 30 minutes from the surgical incision. Duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis should not exceed 24 hours for most surgical procedures. Tan et alconducted a systematic review and found that in the presence of intraoperative and pre-incisional antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative antibiotics for surgical site infection reduction did not show evidence of reduced infection rates in lumbar spinal surgery patients. Therefore, postoperative administration of prophylactic antibiotics after posterior SIJ fusion surgery is not supported.

### Use of feedback data to reduce surgical site infections and optimize antibiotic use in surgery: a systematic scoping review [^113inFmM]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Postoperative infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are indivisible global threats. Global guidelines have been issued to mitigate the risk of postoperative infections, including surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. The global incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is estimated by WHO to be 3% to 50%, depending on the type of surgery. In Europe, SSIs represent 17% of all healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Other postoperative infections that occur beyond the incision site (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis) also represent a substantial burden and safety concern in perioperative care. In low and middle income countries SSIs account for about 60% of total HAIs. Despite preventive measures, postoperative infections are a major cause of morbidity in Africa with postoperative complications occurring in 18.2% of 10,885 patients in a prospective observational cohort study. Consequently, up to 60% of surgical patients receive antibiotics postoperatively whilst in hospital and up to 50% are discharged with a course of antibiotics. Many of these prescriptions may be inappropriate, thereby feeding the AMR problem in a vicious cycle. AMR resulting from antimicrobial overuse threatens society's long-term capacity to effectively deliver high-quality perioperative care and healthcare overall.

One commonly used "family" of interventions that is applied within perioperative care to improve antibiotic selection and timing is surveillance methods. Surveillance methods effectively rely on regular collection of data around a specific intervention (eg, timing and selection of antibiotics to be used perioperatively). Within hospitals, surveillance methods are a key component of infection prevention and control and have been shown to drive down infection rates. However, the mechanism that drives such decreases of postoperative infection rates remains poorly understood. Surveillance alone, that is, carrying out audits of SSIs and their possible causations, does not lead per se to automatic improvement in infection rates. What has been shown in the literature is that for surveillance to improve outcomes it needs to be paired with effective feedback mechanisms to frontline providers, so they can change their behavior in light of the quantitative data presented to them. Epidemiologic surveillance coupled with feedback to providers is known in the evidence base as "audit-and-feedback". Specifically in relation to the use of antibiotics, use of "audit-and-feedback" has been found effective in changing how antibiotics are prescribed perioperatively; improving patient outcomes; and reducing health care costs.

### Significant reduction of wound infections with daily probing of contaminated wounds: a prospective randomized clinical trial… [^111FGqVG]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Study patients were randomized to the control arm or the WPP arm. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated preoperatively and continued until resolution of fever and normalization of the white blood cell count. Follow-up was at 2 weeks and at 3 months. Except for perioperative systemic antibiotics, no single local wound therapy has been proven to decrease the SSI rate in large randomized trials. Examples of local therapy considered include topical antibiotics, subcutaneous drain placement, and delayed primary closure. 5–8 There is no standard wound management for contaminated wounds, but the topic has not been aggressively pursued for decades. Before the use of antibiotics, postoperative SSI after appendectomy for a perforated appendicitis was as high as 70%.

9 Since the introduction of routine prophylactic antibiotic use, infection rates in the most contaminated groups have reduced drastically. 10 Infection rates in US National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system hospitals are reported to be 7. 1% for contaminated wounds, although this number can increase to 50% in certain subgroups.
11. Study patients started perioperative intravenous antibiotic therapy per the standard appendectomy protocol at our hospital. Antibiotic therapy was continued until patients were afebrile for longer than 24 hours and had a normal or decreasing white blood cell count. On postoperative days 1, 3, and 5, quantitative bacterial cultures were obtained from the cotton-tipped applicators used to probe the wound in the WPP arm.

If the wounds of control- or WPP-arm patients were deemed to be infected, cultures of the drainage from these wounds were also taken. Postoperatively, patients had similar incisional lengths. Patients were afebrile, with a normal heart rate and normalization of their white blood cell count within a similar postoperative period. Patients in the control arm reached a wound ASEPSIS score of 0 significantly earlier than those in the WPP arm; however, the range of scores was much wider among the control patients.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^114cbvjb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate surgical wound and incision management in the postoperative time period is imperative to prevent SSIs. The term "surgical wound" used in this document refers to a wound created when an incision is made with a scalpel or other sharp cutting device and then closed in the operating room by suture, staple, adhesive tape, or glue and resulting in a close approximation of the skin edges. It is traditional to cover such wounds with a dressing, which acts as a physical barrier to protect the wound from contamination from the external environment until it becomes impermeable to microorganisms.

To assess the effects of wound dressings compared with no wound dressings, and the effects of alternative wound dressings, in preventing SSIs in surgical wound healing by primary intention, a Cochrane review was published in 2016. The authors concluded that it is uncertain whether covering surgical wound healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision-makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.

The WHO Global Guidelines for the Prevention of SSIs suggest not using any type of advanced dressing over a standard dressing on primarily closed surgical wounds for the purpose of preventing SSI. Low-quality evidence from ten RCTs shows that advanced dressings applied on primarily closed incisional wounds do not significantly reduce SSI rates compared to standard wound dressings. Postoperative care bundles recommend that surgical dressings be kept undisturbed for a minimum of 48 h after surgery unless leakage occurs.

Question 20. How can we engage surgeons in appropriate infection prevention and management?

Statement 20.1. Active education techniques, such as academic detailing, consensus building sessions and educational workshops, should be implemented in each hospital worldwide according to its own resources.

Statement 20.2. Surgeons with satisfactory knowledge in surgical infections should be involved in the infection control team and recognized as "champions" by the hospital's administration.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after operations — initial management and when to use antibiotics — are outlined as follows: surveillance standards mandate 30 days of follow-up for operations without placement of prosthetic material and for 1 year for operations where a prosthesis was inserted; the most important therapy for an SSI is to open the incision, evacuate the infected material, and continue dressing changes until the wound heals by secondary intention; if there is < 5 cm of erythema and induration with minimal systemic signs (temperature < 38.5°C, white blood cell (WBC) count < 12 000 cells/μL, and pulse < 100 beats/minute), antibiotics are unnecessary; patients with temperature > 38.5°C or heart rate > 110 beats/minute or erythema extending beyond the wound margins for > 5 cm may require a short course (eg, 24–48 hours) of antibiotics and opening of the suture line; for intestinal or female genital tract operations with mixed flora, antibiotics considered suitable for treatment of intra-abdominal infection are appropriate, and when MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) risk is present the initial antibiotic should include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline plus piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftriaxone and metronidazole for gram-negative and anaerobic coverage; for incision and drainage of superficial abscesses, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended.

### Prevention of surgical site infection [^1159B5ML]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections are a frequent cause of morbidity following surgical procedures. Gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococci, cause many of these infections, although gram-negative organisms are also frequently involved. The risk of developing a surgical site infection is associated with a number of factors, including aspects of the operative procedure itself, such as wound classification, and patient-related variables, such as preexisting medical conditions. Both nonpharmacologic measures and antimicrobial prophylaxis for selected procedures are used to prevent development of these infections. Compliance with these generally accepted preventive principles may lead to overall decreases in the incidence of these infections.

### Surgical site infection prevention: a review [^114wN9BA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on surgical site infection:

- **Definition**: SSI is an infection that develops within 30 days after surgery, or within one year if an implant is involved, impacting either the incision or the deeper tissues at the surgical site.
- **Pathophysiology**: SSIs result from the contamination of the surgical site with microorganisms, which can occur during the procedure or postoperatively. The pathogens responsible vary by surgery type, with the most commonly isolated organisms including S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus species, and E. coli.
- **Epidemiology**: SSIs are estimated to occur in 2–4% of inpatient surgical procedures in the US, accounting for 20–31% of all hospital-acquired infections.
- **Risk factors**: Numerous patient-related and procedure-related factors influence the risk of SSI. These include longer hospital stay, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive HF, COPD, neurologic diseases, tobacco use, alcohol use, depression, dementia, anemia, immunosuppressive agents, HIV/AIDS, hypoalbuminemia, and postoperative hyperglycemia.
- **Disease course**: SSI typically present with signs of inflammation such as localized redness, warmth, swelling, and pain at the incision site. Fever and purulent discharge may also be present. In severe cases, SSI can lead to wound dehiscence or abscess formation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: SSI can lead to significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and in severe cases, can be life-threatening. SSIs are associated with a 2–11-fold increase in mortality risk. The prognosis can be improved with early detection, appropriate management, and adherence to preventive measures.

### New WHO recommendations on intraoperative and postoperative measures for surgical site infection prevention: an evidence-based global perspective [^113UgEif]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common health-care-associated infections in developing countries, but they also represent a substantial epidemiological burden in high-income countries. The prevention of these infections is complex and requires the integration of a range of preventive measures before, during, and after surgery. No international guidelines are available and inconsistencies in the interpretation of evidence and recommendations in national guidelines have been identified. Considering the prevention of SSIs as a priority for patient safety, WHO has developed evidence-based and expert consensus-based recommendations on the basis of an extensive list of preventive measures. We present in this Review 16 recommendations specific to the intraoperative and postoperative periods. The WHO recommendations were developed with a global perspective and they take into account the balance between benefits and harms, the evidence quality level, cost and resource use implications, and patient values and preferences.

### Controlling the controls: what is negative pressure wound therapy compared to in clinical trials? [^1179giLZ]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are common following colorectal operations. Clinical trials suggest that closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) may reduce SSIs compared to a 'standard of care' group. However, wound management in the standard of care group may vary. The aim of this review was to assess the control arms in trials of ciNPWT for potential confounding variables that could influence the rates of SSI and therefore the trial outcomes.

Methods

A mapping review of the PubMed database was undertaken in the English language for randomized controlled trials that assessed, in closed surgical wounds, the use of ciNPWT compared to standard of care with SSI as an outcome. Data regarding wound care to assess potential confounding factors that may influence SSI rates were compared between the ciNPWT and standard of care groups. Included were the method of wound closure, control dressing type, frequency of dressing changes and postoperative wound care (washing).

Results

Twenty-seven trials were included in the mapping review. There was heterogeneity in ciNPWT duration. There was little control in the comparator standard of care groups with a variety of wound closure techniques and different control dressings used. Overall standard of care dressings were changed more frequently than the ciNPWT dressing and there was no control over wound care or washing. No standard for 'standard of care' was apparent.

Conclusion

In randomized trials assessing the intervention of ciNPWT compared to standard of care there was considerable heterogeneity in the comparator groups and no standard of care was apparent. Heterogeneity in dressing protocols for standard of care groups could introduce potential confounders impacting SSI rates. There is a need to standardize care in ciNPWT trials to assess potential meaningful differences in SSI prevention.

Postoperative Period

Implementation of standardized guidelines aims to improve overall patient care and decrease patient morbidity and mortality. The 2017 NACC guidelines recommend using a sterile occlusive dressing over the wounds for 24–48 hours. Routine postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours and topical antimicrobial agents are not recommended. The patient and family should be well educated on the care of the incision and techniques for wound surveillance, along with a two-week follow-up. If the surgical dressing needs to be changed, it should be done using hand washing and sterile technique. A study of nearly 200 pain physicians demonstrated that 44% of clinicians utilize antibiotics up to 24 hours following implant, 24% use antibiotics for 3–5 days, and 14% for more than five days. Four percent of physicians reported not administering any antibiotics for the permanent implant.

Despite advances in infection control measures such as sterile precautions, operating room negative pressure ventilation, surgical barriers, and antimicrobial prophylaxis, surgical site and implanted device infection remain a significant cause of SCS failure, loss of efficacy, device explantation, and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Surveillance programs have been implemented in surgical settings to effectively risk-stratify patients and reduce SSI. For example, patients should be evaluated within 10–14 days following surgery to assess for adequate wound healing and to identify signs of SSI. Further, patients should be educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of an SSI, as vigilance and early recognition are critical to improved outcomes.

Data extraction and management

We extracted and summarised details of the eligible studies using a data extraction sheet. Two review authors (two of CR, TS, GN, RA and AR) extracted data independently and resolved disagreements by discussion, drawing on a third review author (JD) where required. Where key data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact the study authors to obtain this information. Where a study with more than two intervention arms was included, we only extracted data from intervention and control groups that met the eligibility criteria.

We extracted the following data, where possible, by treatment group for the prespecified interventions and outcomes in this review. We planned to collect outcome data for relevant time points, as described in Types of outcome measures; in practice most studies reported only one time point.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis for colorectal surgery [^111nNCu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Research shows that administration of prophylactic antibiotics before colorectal surgery prevents postoperative surgical wound infection. The best antibiotic choice, timing of administration and route of administration remain undetermined.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical wound infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically to determine:1. whether antimicrobial prophylaxis reduces the risk of surgical wound infection;2. the target spectrum of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, or both);3. the best timing and duration of antibiotic administration;4. the most effective route of antibiotic administration (intravenous, oral or both);5. whether any antibiotic is clearly more effective than the currently recommended gold standard specified in published guidelines;6. whether antibiotics should be given before or after surgery.

Search Methods

For the original review published in 2009 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid). For the update of this review we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013. We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotic use in elective and emergency colorectal surgery, with surgical wound infection as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and reviewed by one review author and checked by another only for the single, dichotomous outcome of surgical wound infection. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This updated review includes 260 trials and 68 different antibiotics, including 24 cephalosporins and 43,451 participants. Many studies had multiple variables that separated the two study groups; these could not be compared to other studies that tested one antibiotic and had a single variable separating the two groups. We did not consider the risk of bias arising from attrition and lack of blinding of outcome assessors to affect the results for surgical wound infection. Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection when prophylactic antibiotics were compared to placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.41, high quality evidence). This translates to a reduction in risk from 39% to 13% with prophylactic antibiotics. The slightly higher risk of wound infection with short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotic did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30). Similarly risk of would infection was slightly higher with single-dose antibiotics when compared with multiple dose antibiotics, but the results are compatible with benefit and harm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.10). Additional aerobic coverage and additional anaerobic coverage both showed statistically significant improvements in surgical wound infection rates (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68 and RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71, respectively), as did combined oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to intravenous alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.74), or oral alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76). Comparison of an antibiotic with anaerobic specificity to one with aerobic specificity showed no significant advantage for either one (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.36). Two small studies compared giving antibiotics before or after surgery and no significant difference in this timing was found (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.15). Established gold-standard regimens recommended in major guidelines were no less effective than any other antibiotic choice.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has found high quality evidence that antibiotics covering aerobic and anaerobic bacteria delivered orally or intravenously (or both) prior to elective colorectal surgery reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Our review shows that antibiotics delivered within this framework can reduce the risk of postoperative surgical wound infection by as much as 75%. It is not known whether oral antibiotics would still have these effects when the colon is not empty. This aspect of antibiotic dosing has not been tested. Further research is required to establish the optimal timing and duration of dosing, and the frequency of longer-term adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.

Despite major advances in surgical management and approaches, including aseptic techniques, prophylactic antibiotics, and laparoscopic surgery, surgical wound infection and wound failure remain common complications of surgery. In a review of the literature, the authors found that a growing body of literature supports the concept that patient factors are a major determinant of wound outcome after surgery. In particular, wounds are exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia, which is both common and preventable. Perioperative management can be adapted to promote postoperative wound healing and resistance to infection. The most important factors are fluid management, temperature management, pain control, increased arterial oxygen tension, and, as has been long recognized, appropriate sterile techniques and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. This article reviews how knowledge of and attention to physiology can improve quality of care in both acute and chronic wounds.

### A prospective randomized trial to assess oral versus intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of postoperative wound infection after extremity fractures (POvIV study) [^112RL4ZS]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Patients surgically treated for infection after extremity fractures are typically discharged with a 6- to 12-week antibiotic regimen. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are associated with significant cost and potential complications of deep vein thrombosis, line clotting, and sepsis. Many of the pathogens that cause musculoskeletal infection have both oral (PO) and IV antibiotic options with adequate bioavailability and antibacterial effect, yet IV antibiotics remain the standard of care absent evidence that PO options are clinically as efficacious. The POvIV study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to compare PO with IV antibiotic therapy in patients with postoperative wound infections after extremity fractures. Patients between the ages of 18 and 84 who have a culture-positive surgical site infection after internal fixation for fracture repair or arthrodesis are approached for this study, and if they provide consent, are randomly assigned to receive either PO or IV antibiotics. Antibiotic selection is based on culture and sensitivity results. Randomization determines the route of administration. Patients are followed for 1 year after study enrollment. This study will be the largest prospective randomized trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PO antibiotic use for treatment of postoperative wound infections. Results will inform clinician decisions on antibiotic delivery in patients with postoperative wound infections.

What is the best treatment of incisional SSIs? When are antibiotics needed?

Incisional SSIs require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. We recommend antibiotic therapy for incisional SSIs with any Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are generally classified according to CDC criteria. SSIs are classified as superficial incisional infection, deep incisional infection, and organ space infection. Superficial incisional infections are the most common type of SSIs. Deep incisional and organ/space are the types of SSIs that cause the most morbidity. Organ space infections are not genuine soft-tissue infections.

Incisional SSIs are the results of several factors. All surgical wounds are contaminated by bacteria, but only a minority actually develops clinical infection. Colonization occurs when the bacteria begin to replicate and adhere to the wound site. If the host's immune response is not sufficient to eliminate or overcome the effects of the bacteria, infection occurs. In most patients, infection does not develop because host defenses are efficient to eliminate colonizers at the surgical site; however, in some patients, host defenses fail to protect them from SSIs. It is well known that surgical trauma increases inflammatory response and counter-regulatory mechanisms. Such regulatory mechanism can decrease postoperative immune response, promoting SSIs.

Infection Risk Factors

Potential risk factors for postoperative infection and poor wound healing are illustrated in Table 1. Patients being considered for implantation should be screened for risk factors such as smoking, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, anemia, poor hygiene, history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), pre-existing infections, and previous post-operative wound infections. In neuromodulation, the generator pocket site is the most common site of postoperative infection (54%), followed by SCS leads (14%) and lumbar incision sites (8%). However, there is some inconsistency in the literature. Mekhail et al reported no increased infection rate in people with diabetes compared to those with other comorbidities. Engle et al reported no significant difference in infection rate between patients with and without cancer. These findings highlight the need for further research to better understand the relationship between diabetes and postoperative infection risk.

### Postoperative wound care protocol prevents surgical site infection after craniotomy [^111d2xGe]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 50,000 craniotomy procedures are performed annually in the United States. Surgical site infections (SSIs) after craniotomy cause substantial morbidity and mortality, often requiring extended hospital stays and additional operations. –

Approximately 70% to 95% of SSIs are caused by endogenous flora colonizing the head, neck, and shoulder area. Most SSI prevention strategies involve preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, incisional skin antisepsis, appropriate hair removal, antibiotic prophylaxis, intraoperative vancomycin powder and irrigation solution, various closure methods and/or materials, and managing postoperative hyperglycemia. – Some also include screening for and decolonizing Staphylococcus aureus carriers.

In contrast to preoperative and perioperative SSI prevention guidance, postoperative craniotomy SSI prevention efforts have not been standardized. Evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a specific postoperative wound care protocol. Although various publications for postoperative wound management after craniotomy have included options for advanced dressingsand prophylactic topical antibiotic application to the incision, studies focusing on care for postoperative incisional wounds and adjacent hair are lacking.

Post-craniotomy incisional care is complicated by local wound factors, including the high vascularity of the face and scalp (which contributes to clot formation), the high microbial colonization of the sebaceous scalp and head, and the presence of hair, as some neurosurgeons prefer to minimize hair clipping along the incision line. Hair not only causes physical contamination of the incision, but it raises questions about how to keep the area clean and keep adhesive dressings in place.

The objectives of this study were to design an effective postoperative wound care protocol for cleaning craniotomy incisions as well as the surrounding hair, and to evaluate the impact on SSI.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^115wEGNn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Postoperative wound complications are common following surgical procedures. Negative‐pressure wound therapy is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whetherreduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials ofcompared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions.

Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients.was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk 0.54, 95 per cent c.i. 0.33 to 0.89) and seroma formation (0.48, 0.27 to 0.84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence.

Conclusion

Compared with standard postoperative dressings, significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds. Heterogeneity between the included studies means that no general recommendations can be made yet.

Measuring quality of care

To measure the performance of quality of care across different surgical systems, the Donabedian model was used. This model uses key metrics to assess structures, processes and outcomes within health systems. To ensure relevance to surgical systems, key metrics were identified and mapped to each of these domains through a consensus process with the trial management group, with expertise in surgery, perioperative care, public health and methodology. Briefly, key metrics mapped were as follows: (1) structure was assessed by availability of trained consultant surgeons and anaesthetists; (2) process was assessed by the casemix of surgery being performed defined as the proportion of patients with ASA grades III–V, emergency surgery and use of the WHO surgical safety checklist and (3) outcomes defined as postoperative mortality and SSI.

Postoperative mortality was defined as death within 30 days of surgery. SSI up to 30 days from surgery was defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of deep incisional or superficial incisional SSI as follows: (1) the infection occurred within 30 days of the index operation; (2) the infection involved the skin, subcutaneous, muscular or fascial layers of the incision; (3) the patient had at least one of purulent drainage from the wound, organisms detected by wound swab, diagnosis clinically or at imaging, or wound opened spontaneously or by a clinician and (4) the patient had at least one of pain, tenderness, localised swelling, redness, heat at the wound site or systemic fever (> 38°C). In both the FALCON and CHEETAH trials, outcome assessors underwent rigorous training to conduct follow-up assessments, either face to face or via telephone, employing a set of predefined questions to ensure consistency and accuracy in data collection.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114YuKjc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogens isolated from infections differ, primarily depending on the type of surgical procedure. In clean-contaminated or contaminated surgical procedures, the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the normal endogenous microflora of the surgically resected organ are the most frequently isolated pathogens. In clean surgical procedures, in which the gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and respiratory tracts have not been entered, Staphylococcus aureus from the exogenous environment or the patient's skin flora is the usual cause of infection. Nevertheless, in some specific body areas such as the groin skin could also be colonized by enteric flora. Moreover, it is possible that procedures such as hip prosthesis or vascular bypass, performed on this anatomical region, might eventually be infected by Gram-negative bacteria.

Sganga et al. have recently reported that the risk factors associated with SSIs caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), identified using the Delphi method were patients from long-stay care facilities, a hospitalization within the preceding 30 days, Charlson score > 5 points, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and thoracic surgery, antibiotic therapy with beta-lactams (especially cephalosporins), and carbapenems and/or quinolones in the preceding 30 days, age 75 years or older, current duration of hospitalization > 16 days, and surgery with prosthesis implantation.

An important determinant of SSI is the integrity of host defenses. Important host factors include the following: age, malnutrition status, diabetes, smoking, obesity, colonization with microorganisms, length of hospital stay or previous hospitalization, shock and hypoxemia, and hypothermia.

It is a common practice to cover surgical wounds with a dressing. The dressing acts as a physical barrier to protect the wound from contamination from the external environment until the wound becomes impermeable to microorganisms.

Postoperative care bundles recommend that surgical dressings be kept undisturbed for a minimum of 48 h after surgery unless leakage occurs. However, there are currently no specific recommendations or guidelines regarding the type of surgical dressing.

The diagnosis of incisional surgical site infection is clinical. Symptoms may include localized erythema, induration, warmth, and pain at the incision site. Purulent wound drainage and separation of the wound may occur. Most patients have systemic signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Information on the microbiological species present in the wound is useful for determining antibiotic choice and predicting response to treatment.

### Breaking boundaries in spinal surgery: GPT-4's quest to revolutionize surgical site infection management [^115Dr6BY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a significant component of hospital-acquired infections, primarily manifesting as incisional infections in patients undergoing spinal surgery. Several studies indicate that the postoperative SSI rate after spinal surgery ranges from 0.8% to 7.5%. SSI is a serious complication that concerns both healthcare professionals and patients, impacting recovery. Spinal surgeries often involve complex anatomical structures such as vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and neural structures, with substantial surgical trauma making the site susceptible to infection. Postoperative SSIs may lead to poor wound healing, implant infections, or systemic infections, significantly affecting recovery and quality of life. In recent years, the risk of SSI has been exacerbated by the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. These pathogens are resistant to conventional antibiotics, complicating infection treatment. Traditional infection control methods relying on clinical experience and routine strategies may not fully leverage the hidden data correlations and patterns within medical information.

Managing SSI in spinal surgery is a significant challenge (Figure 1). The complexities of SSI extend beyond the surgical procedure itself. Spinal surgeries require extensive skin and soft tissue incisions to ensure adequate visibility and maneuverability for surgeons, significantly increasing the risk of infection from both external and patient-related factors. The lengthy duration of spinal surgeries and extensive tissue damage not only prolong recovery but also make postoperative wound healing more difficult and prone to infection. Implants such as screws, plates, bone grafts, and supports, essential for repairing and stabilizing spinal structures, also increase infection risk. The surfaces of these implants can serve as attachment points for bacteria, leading to implant loosening or displacement and requiring additional surgery, thus increasing the physical and psychological burden on patients and treatment costs. Additionally, patients undergoing spinal surgery often present with various infection risk factors, including advanced age, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression, smoking, and a history of previous surgeries. These factors can weaken immune defenses, delay wound healing, and increase susceptibility to infections. Postoperative dietary habits, activity levels, and the quality of rehabilitation management play crucial roles in infection control and prevention, further complicating the management of SSI.

Results

Delphi prioritization of guideline topics

A total of 56 surgeons from across 15 LMICs proposed 34 guideline topics. The top 12 topics were shortlisted, and these were then prioritized in an online vote by 736 participants representing 82 LMICs. The overall top ranked topic (Fig. 1) was prevention of surgical‐site infection (SSI); this was ranked in the top two guideline topics across all country‐income strata (Table S3, supporting information). The steering committee refined the scope for this guideline to focus on preoperative and intraoperative interventions aimed at reducing SSI risk in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Postoperative interventions and the management of SSI were not planned to be included in the guideline.

Stage 0: preparation of initial draft recommendations

In keeping with the planned methodology, a search was completed on 12 September 2018 to identify existing guidelines relevant to the prevention of SSI. Five eligible guidelines 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for the prevention of SSI were identified. A total of 160 recommendations were extracted from the guidelines. Following consolidation of identical recommendations across different guidelines, 124 recommendations remained. Of these, 56 recommendations were eligible according to the criteria of being supported by at least two separate guidelines, with moderate to strong supporting evidence. Similar recommendations were synthesized and refined, producing a shortlist of 31 draft recommendations (Table S2, supporting information). The flow of recommendations through the guideline development process is summarized in Fig. 2.

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure management for posterior lumbar spine infections [^11129fZz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

A postoperative infection involving the tissues deep to the fascia is defined as a deep wound infection (DWI). Management of such infections after lumbar spinal surgery remains a challenge. One strategy is the use of vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC) which applies negative pressure to the wound to improve microcirculation and to promote the formation of granulation tissue. When combined with antibiotics, VAC has been shown to successfully treat DWIs and is now a common strategy for treating deep postoperative wound infections after spinal surgery. In this article, we review the technique of VAC, its mechanism of action, indications and contraindications, and clinical outcomes in the treatment of DWIs after lumbar spinal surgery.

### The role of postoperative factors in surgical site infections: time to take notice [^112HdDS8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to occur, in many instances despite high compliance with best practice measures primarily revolving around pre- and intraoperative periods. Postoperative factors have traditionally been considered to play a relatively minor role in the causation of SSIs. An increasing body of evidence, however, suggests that many SSIs occur as a result of pathogens gaining access to surgical wounds either hematogenously, through drains, or through slowly healing wounds due to systemic anticoagulation or other factors, particularly in the setting of high compliance with standard perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Evidence also supports frequent acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) during the postoperative period. These findings, coupled with lack of clear efficacy of various pre- and intraoperative interventions such as MRSA decolonization and use of vancomycin for prophylaxis against this organism, should force us to consider the important role that postoperative factors may play in the causation of SSIs in the current era.

### Incisional negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site infection: an up-to-date meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1132udRb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common postoperative complication and causes increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Furthermore, other wound complications such as wound dehiscence, hematoma, seroma, and skin necrosis occur frequently. The evidence on prophylactic use of negative pressure wound therapy on primary closed incisional wounds (iNPWT) for the prevention of postoperative wound complications, including SSI, is confusing and ambiguous. It is hypothesised that iNPWT reduces bacterial contamination, exudate and oedema, promotes lymphatic and local blood flow, and stimulates tissue granulation.

iNPWT has been the subject of multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The current international guidelines, for the prevention of SSI and meta-analyses make inconsistent recommendations. Unfortunately, there is great clinical and methodological heterogeneity between these guidelines and articles, which creates confusion and ambiguity, potentially impairing implementation. The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline [published 2018] suggests the use of iNPWT in high-risk wounds with an overall low quality evidence, based on six RCTs and 15 observational studies. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only published a medical technologies guidance in 2019, recommending the PICO device in high-risk patients, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not mention iNPWT in their current guideline. Several previous meta-analyses show moderate and high certainty evidence that iNPWT reduces the risk of SSI compared with standard dressings. The most recent Cochrane Review on this topic found moderate certainty evidence in favour of iNPWT. Despite this evidence, the use of iNPWT is still not standard practice. This is possibly due to the ambiguity of recommendations from trials and guidelines, and the focus of surgeons on their own subspecialty which causes them to disregard results in general populations. However, there is no biological reason to expect a difference in effect between different types of surgery. Recently, new RCTs have been published. Available meta-analyses have not incorporated these RCTs in quantitative analyses and therefore lag behind.

### Impact of video-assisted thoracic surgery versus open thoracotomy on postoperative wound infections in lung cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178aDxb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The surgical management of lung cancer has witnessed significant evolution over the years, with VATS procedures gaining prominence due to their minimally invasive nature. The paradigm shift from open thoracotomy to VATS has been driven by the pursuit of reducing postoperative morbidity and improving patient outcomes. The differential impact of these surgical techniques on the incidence of postoperative wound infections is a critical aspect that merits detailed examination. Postoperative wound infections are a serious complication that can lead to increased morbidity, extended hospital stays, and additional healthcare costs. They pose a substantial burden on patients, often complicating recovery and potentially affecting long-term survival. Within the context of lung cancer surgery, the meticulous comparison between VATS and open thoracotomy procedures is of paramount importance given the fragile health status of patients who typically present with a myriad of comorbidities, which may predispose them to a higher risk of complications.

The results of our meta-analysis, encompassing six studies on VATS versus open thoracotomy procedures, have illuminated a critical aspect of postoperative care in lung cancer surgery. Notably, the analysis revealed that patients undergoing open thoracotomy procedures exhibited a twofold increased risk of postoperative wound infections when compared to those receiving VATS. This finding is both statistically significant and clinically relevant, suggesting a substantive disparity in the safety profile of these two surgical modalities, specifically concerning wound-related outcomes. The inherent mechanisms contributing to this discrepancy are multifaceted, rooted in both the physiological impact of the surgical technique and the patient recovery trajectory. Open thoracotomy procedures are typically more invasive than VATS ones, involving larger incisions that breach the integrity of the chest wall and potentially expose a greater surface area to infectious agents. This invasiveness can beget a cascade of systemic inflammatory responses, which may undermine the body's ability to fend off infections. The larger wounds associated with open thoracotomies require more extensive tissue manipulation and longer operative times, both of which have been correlated with higher infection rates in various types of surgeries.

### Challenges and management of surgical site occurrences [^113jZ4HC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications such as surgical site infections, dehiscence, seromas, and hematomas prolong wound care and impose significant cost increases to patients and healthcare providers. Clinicians aiming to reduce the incidence of these complications should be aware of risk factors associated with surgical type, procedures used, patient characteristics, and postoperative care. Today, improved guidelines and general practices for managing surgical incisions have reduced the incidence of complications to historic lows. In addition to these standard care options, advanced wound care approaches have been extensively studied and exist as options for clinicians to provide adjunctive postoperative support and facilitate wound healing. These systems include advanced wound dressings and closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Advanced wound care is not appropriate in all settings, and healthcare providers must assess each case for specific needs to be addressed by the available incision management plans. Emerging therapies that are intended to improve the continuum of postoperative care should continue to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine their effectiveness under different circumstances and to support the creation of more robust guidelines for their use.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — benefits, harms, and outcome importance: Modification of these risk factors, when possible, has the potential to significantly decrease postoperative infection in patients with major extremity trauma. This data provides information that may improve patient counseling in the perioperative period, and although some of these risk factors can be modified in the immediate postoperative period, it is unclear how this may or may not influence outcomes.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for surgical wounds healing by primary closure [^112HAf25]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Indications for the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) are broad and include prophylaxis for surgical site infections (SSIs). Existing evidence for the effectiveness of NPWT on postoperative wounds healing by primary closure remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NPWT for preventing SSI in wounds healing through primary closure, and to assess the cost‐effectiveness of NPWT in wounds healing through primary closure.

Search methods

In June 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and references of included studies, systematic reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, publication date or study setting.

Selection criteria

We included trials if they allocated participants to treatment randomly and compared NPWT with any other type of wound dressing, or compared one type of NPWT with another type of NPWT.

Data collection and analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trials using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and quality assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology.

Main results

In this third update, we added 15 new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three new economic studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (7447 included participants) and five economic studies. Studies evaluated NPWT in the context of a wide range of surgeries including orthopaedic, obstetric, vascular and general procedures. Economic studies assessed NPWT in orthopaedic, obstetric and general surgical settings. All studies compared NPWT with standard dressings. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias for at least one key domain.

Primary outcomes

Four studies (2107 participants) reported mortality. There is low‐certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of death after surgery for people treated with NPWT (2.3%) compared with standard dressings (2.7%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.47; I² = 0%). Thirty‐nine studies reported SSI; 31 of these (6204 participants), were included in meta‐analysis. There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) that NPWT probably results in fewer SSI (8.8% of participants) than treatment with standard dressings (13.0% of participants) after surgery; RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.80; I² = 23%). Eighteen studies reported dehiscence; 14 of these (3809 participants) were included in meta‐analysis. There is low‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision) showing no clear difference in the risk of dehiscence after surgery for NPWT (5.3% of participants) compared with standard dressings (6.2% of participants) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; I² = 0%).

Secondary outcomes

There is low‐certainty evidence showing no clear difference between NPWT and standard treatment for the outcomes of reoperation and incidence of seroma. For reoperation, the RR was 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; I² = 13%; 12 trials; 3523 participants); for seroma, the RR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.05; I² = 0%; seven trials; 729 participants). The effect of NPWT on occurrence of haematoma or skin blisters is uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence); for haematoma, the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.59; I² = 0%; nine trials; 1202 participants) and for blisters the RR was 2.64 (95% CI 0.65 to 10.68; I² = 69%; seven trials; 796 participants). The overall effect of NPWT on pain is uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence from seven trials (2218 participants) which reported disparate measures of pain); but moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there is probably little difference between the groups in pain after three or six months following surgery for lower limb fracture (one trial, 1549 participants). There is also moderate‐certainty evidence for women undergoing caesarean sections (one trial, 876 participants) and people having surgery for lower limb fractures (one trial, 1549 participants) that there is probably little difference in quality of life scores at 30 days or 3 or 6 months, respectively.

Cost‐effectiveness

Five economic studies, based wholly or partially on trials included in our review, assessed the cost‐effectiveness of NPWT compared with standard care. They considered NPWT in four indications: caesarean sections in obese women; surgery for lower limb fracture; knee/hip arthroplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They calculated quality‐adjusted life‐years for treatment groups and produced estimates of the treatments' relative cost‐effectiveness. The reporting quality was good but the grade of the evidence varied from moderate to very low. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that NPWT in surgery for lower limb fracture was not cost‐effective at any threshold of willingness‐to‐pay and that NPWT is probably cost‐effective in obese women undergoing caesarean section. Other studies found low or very low‐certainty evidence indicating that NPWT may be cost‐effective for the indications assessed.

Authors' conclusions

People experiencing primary wound closure of their surgical wound and treated prophylactically with NPWT following surgery probably experience fewer SSI than people treated with standard dressings (moderate‐certainty evidence). There is no clear difference in number of deaths or wound dehiscence between people treated with NPWT and standard dressings (low‐certainty evidence). There are also no clear differences in secondary outcomes where all evidence was low or very low‐certainty. In caesarean section in obese women and surgery for lower limb fracture, there is probably little difference in quality of life scores (moderate‐certainty evidence). Most evidence on pain is very low‐certainty, but there is probably no difference in pain between NPWT and standard dressings after surgery for lower limb fracture (moderate‐certainty evidence). Assessments of cost‐effectiveness of NPWT produced differing results in different indications. There is a large number of ongoing studies, the results of which may change the findings of this review. Decisions about use of NPWT should take into account surgical indication and setting and consider evidence for all outcomes.

### Surgical site infections [^112Mgd7V]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in postsurgical care. Risk for surgical site infection is multifactorial and includes a host of microbial, patient-related, and procedure-related factors. Prevention of surgical infection relies on optimization of patient factors and use of a variety of evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures. At the forefront of these measures is antimicrobial prophylaxis, which has been shown to be effective at reducing risk of surgical site infection. As guidelines for prevention of surgical site infection become increasingly complex and nuanced, surgical infection outcomes are increasing tied to quality outcome and performances measures.

### Intraoperative interventions for preventing surgical site infection: an overview of cochrane reviews [^111XhQem]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) rates vary from 1% to 5% in the month following surgery. Due to the large number of surgical procedures conducted annually, the costs of these SSIs can be considerable in financial and social terms. Many interventions are used with the aim of reducing the risk of SSI in people undergoing surgery. These interventions can be broadly delivered at three stages: preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. The intraoperative interventions are largely focused on decontamination of skin using soap and antiseptics; the use of barriers to prevent movement of micro-organisms into incisions; and optimising the patient's own bodily functions to promote best recovery. Both decontamination and barrier methods can be aimed at people undergoing surgery and operating staff. Other interventions focused on SSI prevention may be aimed at the surgical environment and include methods of theatre cleansing and approaches to managing theatre traffic.

Objectives

To present an overview of Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of interventions, delivered during the intraoperative period, aimed at preventing SSIs in all populations undergoing surgery in an operating theatre.

Methods

Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting the effectiveness of interventions delivered during the intraoperative period in terms of SSI prevention were eligible for inclusion in this overview. We also identified Cochrane protocols and title registrations for future inclusion into the overview. We searched the Cochrane Library on 01 July 2017. Two review authors independently screened search results and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and certainty assessment. We used the ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews) tool to assess the quality of included reviews, and we used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We summarised the characteristics of included reviews in the text and in additional tables.

Main Results

We included 32 Cochrane Reviews in this overview: we judged 30 reviews as being at low risk of bias and two at unclear risk of bias. Thirteen reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Two reviews had no relevant data to extract. We extracted data from 30 reviews with 349 included trials, totaling 73,053 participants. Interventions assessed included gloving, use of disposable face masks, patient oxygenation protocols, use of skin antiseptics for hand washing and patient skin preparation, vaginal preparation, microbial sealants, methods of surgical incision, antibiotic prophylaxis and methods of skin closure. Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence for outcomes was low or very low. Of the 77 comparisons providing evidence for the outcome of SSI, seven provided high- or moderate-certainty evidence, 39 provided low-certainty evidence and 31 very low-certainty evidence. Of the nine comparisons that provided evidence for the outcome of mortality, five provided low-certainty evidence and four very low-certainty evidence. There is high- or moderate-certainty evidence for the following outcomes for these intraoperative interventions. (1) Prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision reduce SSI risk compared with administration after cord clamping (10 trials, 5041 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.81; high-certainty evidence - assessed by review authors). (2) Preoperative antibiotics reduce SSI risk compared with placebo after breast cancer surgery (6 trials, 1708 participants; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98; high-certainty evidence - assessed by overview authors). (3) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduce SSI risk in caesarean sections compared with no antibiotics (82 relevant trials, 14,407 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias - assessed by review authors). (4) Antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces SSI risk for hernia repair compared with placebo or no treatment (17 trials, 7843 participants; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.84; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias - assessed by overview authors); (5) There is currently no clear difference in the risk of SSI between iodine-impregnated adhesive drapes compared with no adhesive drapes (2 trials, 1113 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.60; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision - assessed by review authors); (6) There is currently no clear difference in SSI risk between short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotics in colorectal surgery (7 trials; 1484 participants; RR 1.05 95% CI 0.78 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence; downgraded once for imprecision - assessed by overview authors). There was only one comparison showing negative effects associated with the intervention: adhesive drapes increase the risk of SSI compared with no drapes (5 trials; 3082 participants; RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.48; high-certainty evidence - rated by review authors).

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on use of intraoperative treatments for the prevention of SSIs from all currently published Cochrane Reviews. There is evidence that some interventions are useful in reducing SSI risk for people undergoing surgery, such as antibiotic prophylaxis for caesarean section and hernia repair, and also the timing of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics administered before caesarean incision. Also, there is evidence that adhesive drapes increase SSI risk. Evidence for the many other treatment choices is largely of low or very low certainty and no quality-of-life or cost-effectiveness data were reported. Future trials should elucidate the relative effects of some treatments. These studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, using robust methodology and being of sufficient duration to adequately assess SSI. Assessment of other outcomes such as mortality might also be investigated as part of non-experimental prospective follow-up of people with SSI of different severity, so the risk of death for different subgroups can be better understood.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### Selection and administration… [^111gGzpE]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

This translates to an additional $1. 5 billion in health care costs annually. 2 The occurrence of wound infection requires a local inoculum sufficient to overcome host defenses and establish growth. The process is complex and depends on the interaction of various host, local tissue and microbial virulence factors. Measures intended to prevent wound infection typically attempt to modify the host and local tissue factors and include, for example, preoperative optimization of comorbid illness, control of the operative environment, proper cleansing of the skin and use of aseptic surgical technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only one relatively minor effort among numerous preventive measures, but the efficacy and impact of antimicrobial prophylaxis has clearly been demonstrated to be significant. 3, 4. The duration of an adequate tissue level of the antibiotic need not exceed the operative period.

The duration of administration is extended only in special circumstances, such as gross contamination secondary to a ruptured viscus or severe trauma. The available data provide no evidence for the efficacy of extending coverage to 24 to 48 hours in such contexts.
17. Neurosurgical Procedures Studies evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in neurosurgical procedures have shown variable results. The supportive data have recently been reviewed. 26, 27 Therefore, additional prophylaxis is recommended. Options include either intraluminal prophylaxis directed at aerobic and anaerobic bacteria or the parenteral administration of similarly active antibiotics immediately before the operation. 28 In general, the addition of intraluminal antibiotics reduces the risk of infection to approximately 9 percent or less, similar to the risk associated with parenteral administration alone.

To summarize, recommendations for prophylaxis of colorectal procedures include the following: mechanical cleansing beginning the day before surgery, typically continued until effluent is clear; neomycin and erythromycin base, 1 g of each medication orally at 1 p. m., 2 p. m. and 11 p. m. the day before surgery, and intravenous administration of cefotetan or cefoxitin within 30 minutes of the time of incision. 3 S. aureus and S. epidermidis predominate in wound or joint infections. Cefazolin provides adequate coverage. The additional use of aminoglycosides and extension of coverage beyond the operative period is common but lacks supportive evidence.
