## Question

What is the oral step-down from intravenous (IV) cefazolin 1 to 2g every 8 hours?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the oral step-down options from intravenous cefazolin 1–2 g every 8 hours, including practical, condition-specific regimens to choose, especially cephalexin dosing and stewardship criteria for switching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pharmacologic comparability between cefazolin and oral options. Then, I should verify clinical stability criteria for safe IV-to-oral conversion. Next, I will review infection-specific evidence and guideline-concordant oral regimens. After that, I need to confirm dosing and duration adjustments for renal function, obesity, and pediatric patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical step-down algorithm and summarize the most defensible oral cephalexin regimen with caveats about when to avoid or modify it.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basis for switching from cefazolin to an oral first-generation cephalosporin. Cephalexin is the logical oral analogue with predictable bioavailability and a time-dependent bactericidal profile that requires maintaining free drug concentrations above MIC for at least 40–50% of the dosing interval, so the step-down is pharmacodynamically coherent when the pathogen is susceptible and dosing is adequate [^111t7Zb7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure clinical stability is present before any switch because early IV-to-oral transition hinges on hemodynamic normalization, defervescence, and the ability to absorb and tolerate oral medications. Multiple studies operationalize stability as temperature 37.8°C or less, systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg, heart rate less than 100/min, respiratory rate less than 24/min, and SpO2 greater than 90%, typically after at least 48 hours of IV therapy and with source control addressed when applicable [^116vT8Jq] [^112qUPjp] [^116oDx2e].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality direct evidence for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections. The randomized trial showed oral cephalexin 500 mg four times daily was noninferior to IV cefazolin 2 g daily plus oral probenecid for mild-to-moderate SSTI, with similar 72-hour failure and 7-day cure rates, supporting cephalexin as an effective oral step-down in clinically stable patients with MSSA or streptococcal cellulitis [^113nJwCo].

> I will now examine osteoarticular infections, where practice has long favored an oral step-down after initial IV therapy. Pediatric guidelines endorse transition to high-dose cephalexin after clinical improvement and source control, with 100 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours historically used, though modeling suggests that for MSSA with MIC 2–4 mg/L, higher weight-based regimens may be needed to hit aggressive PK/PD targets, so I should double-check local MIC data and consider dose intensification when MICs are elevated while acknowledging that many children do well with standard high-dose regimens in practice [^111t7Zb7] [^1148B4PD].

> Let me consider Gram-negative bacteremia and UTIs, where the oral switch paradigm has matured. Large cohorts show early transition to appropriate oral therapy within 4–7 days is safe and associated with shorter hospital stays and similar mortality when patients are clinically stable and the organism is susceptible, with fluoroquinolones commonly used but oral beta-lactams acceptable if bioavailability and MICs support efficacy, and randomized data reinforce noninferiority of oral step-down for Enterobacterales bacteremia after initial IV therapy and stability are achieved [^112qUPjp] [^115nHWG3] [^11378cuY] [^115paXq3].

> For intra-abdominal infections after source control, I should confirm that guidelines support switching to oral agents once GI function returns. Contemporary surgical guidance endorses oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate to complete a short course, with total durations often 4–7 days in uncomplicated cases, aligning with stewardship principles to avoid unnecessarily prolonged IV therapy [^114bUgY6] [^116gVbZq].

> Now, let me synthesize a practical adult cephalexin regimen for the most common MSSA/streptococcal SSTI step-down. A standard regimen is 500 mg orally every 6 hours, which provides robust time above MIC for typical MSSA and streptococcal MICs, with IDSA SSTI guidance explicitly listing cephalexin 500 mg four times daily as a treatment option and randomized data supporting noninferiority in cellulitis. I initially thought 1 g every 8 hours might match the q8h cadence of IV cefazolin, but wait, that would likely underperform on %fT > MIC compared with 500 mg every 6 hours for the same total daily dose, so I should correct to 500 mg every 6 hours as the preferred schedule in adults with normal renal function [^113cdboF] [^113nJwCo].

> I need to check special populations and pharmacokinetic modifiers. In obesity, larger cefazolin doses are sometimes needed for prophylaxis due to tissue distribution concerns, and while this does not directly translate to oral cephalexin, it reminds me to reassess clinical response and consider dose optimization if treatment failure is suspected. In renal impairment, I should extend the cephalexin interval rather than reduce the dose to preserve time above MIC, and in pediatrics, 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours is standard, with higher weight-based dosing up to 100 mg/kg/day used for osteoarticular infections in many centers [^113xoNGZ] [^112kGAzB] [^1148B4PD].

> But wait, what if the pathogen is MRSA or there is a true immediate hypersensitivity to beta-lactams? In those scenarios cephalexin should be avoided and an appropriate oral MRSA-active agent or non–beta-lactam alternative selected based on susceptibilities and allergy phenotype, reinforcing that the cephalexin step-down is best reserved for MSSA/streptococcal infections in beta-lactam–tolerant patients [^113cdboF].

> I should confirm timing and stewardship guardrails. IDSA stewardship guidance strongly supports early IV-to-oral conversion once stability criteria are met, and in pneumonia, objective clinical stability rules enable earlier switch with shorter length of stay and lower costs without excess mortality, which can be extrapolated as a principle to other systemic infections where oral bioavailability and activity are adequate [^113c2vU1] [^116oDx2e].

> Let me reconsider duration briefly to ensure completeness. For SSTI, 5–7 days is often sufficient when clinical response is satisfactory, for osteoarticular infections total durations commonly range 2–6 weeks depending on pathogen and surgical management, for uncomplicated Enterobacterales bacteremia 7 days suffices when source control and clinical stability are present, and for intra-abdominal infections 4–7 days is typical after adequate source control, with longer courses reserved for complex presentations or inadequate source control [^113ejiMK] [^114bUgY6].

> Finalizing the recommendation, I should double-check that the most defensible adult step-down for an MSSA or streptococcal SSTI after clinical stability on IV cefazolin is cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours, with adjustments for renal function by extending the interval, pediatric dosing of 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours and higher for osteoarticular disease, and a total treatment duration tailored to infection type and response, all contingent on documented susceptibility, adequate GI absorption, and achievement of stability before switching [^113nJwCo] [^113cdboF] [^111t7Zb7].

---

For most infections, the standard oral step-down from IV cefazolin 1–2 g IV every 8 hours is **cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours** [^113cdboF]. If the infection is severe or the pathogen has a higher MIC, use **cephalexin 1 g orally every 6 hours**. Ensure the patient is clinically stable, has adequate GI function, and that the pathogen is susceptible to cephalexin before switching [^111Hu8AB]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment and consider alternative agents if there is a beta-lactam allergy or resistance.

---

## Recommended oral step-down regimen

The **recommended oral step-down regimen** from IV cefazolin is cephalexin, a first-generation oral cephalosporin with similar antimicrobial activity.

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended oral cephalexin dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard regimen | 500 mg | Every 6 hours (QID) |
| Severe infection or higher MIC | 1 g | Every 6 hours (QID) |

---

These regimens provide **comparable antimicrobial exposure** to IV cefazolin 1–2 g every 8 hours and are supported by clinical guidelines and pharmacokinetic data [^113cdboF] [^1128qv2L].

---

## Clinical considerations for oral step-down therapy

Before switching from IV cefazolin to oral cephalexin, several **clinical factors must be considered**:

- **Clinical stability**: The patient should be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and showing clinical improvement [^116vT8Jq].

- **Gastrointestinal function**: The patient must be able to tolerate oral medications and have adequate gastrointestinal absorption [^111Hu8AB].

- **Pathogen susceptibility**: The causative organism should be susceptible to cephalexin based on culture and sensitivity results [^111Hu8AB].

- **Renal function**: Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral step-down therapy

Clinical studies and guidelines support the **safety and efficacy** of transitioning from IV cefazolin to oral cephalexin:

- **Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs)**: A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that oral cephalexin (500 mg QID) was non-inferior to IV cefazolin plus oral probenecid in the treatment of uncomplicated SSTIs, with similar clinical cure rates and adverse events [^113nJwCo].

- **General infections**: IDSA guidelines recommend cephalexin as an appropriate oral alternative for MSSA and streptococcal infections, including SSTIs, providing a reliable step-down option from IV cefazolin [^113cdboF].

- **Pediatric infections**: High-dose oral cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day divided QID) is recommended for pediatric osteoarticular infections, supporting its efficacy in severe infections [^111t7Zb7].

---

## Special considerations and adjustments

Certain patient populations may require **dose adjustments or alternative agents**:

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance to avoid accumulation and toxicity.

- **Beta-lactam allergy**: Alternative oral agents such as clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be considered based on the clinical scenario and patient tolerance [^1157bqUp].

- **Obesity**: Higher oral doses may be required in obese patients to achieve adequate drug exposure, although specific dosing guidelines are limited.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard regimen**: Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID).

- **Severe infection or higher MIC**: Cephalexin 1 g orally every 6 hours (QID).

- **Clinical stability**: Ensure patient is stable and improving before switching [^11638B9r].

- **Susceptibility**: Confirm pathogen susceptibility to cephalexin [^1177WKdw].

- **Renal function**: Adjust dose as necessary.

- **Alternative agents**: Consider clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for beta-lactam allergy or resistance [^1157bqUp].

---

The recommended oral step-down from IV cefazolin 1–2 g every 8 hours is **cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours**, with dose escalation to 1 g every 6 hours for severe infections or higher MICs. This approach is supported by clinical evidence and guidelines, ensuring continued efficacy and safety.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^115nHWG3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gram-negative bacteremia is a global health concern, and optimizing the transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics is a critical step in improving patient treatment and resource utilization.

Objective

To assess the association of switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture with 90-day all-cause mortality compared with prolonged IV antibiotic treatment for patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study conducted using the target trial emulation framework included observational data from adults with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia in 4 hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021. The duration of follow-up was 90 days. Eligibility criteria included a blood culture positive for growth of gram-negative bacteria, clinical stability within 4 days of initial blood culture, an available susceptibility report on day 4, and initiation of appropriate empirical IV antibiotic treatment within 24 hours of blood culture.

Exposure

Switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture compared with continuing IV antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days after initial blood culture.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to adjust for confounding. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed using pooled logistic regression to estimate absolute risk, risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR); 95% CIs were computed using bootstrapping.

Results

A total of 914 individuals were included in the target trial emulation analysis (512 [56.0%] male; median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3–83.2 years]); 433 (47.4%) transitioned early to oral antibiotic treatment, and 481 (52.6%) received prolonged IV treatment. Ninety-nine individuals (10.8%) died during follow-up. The proportion of individuals who died was higher in the group receiving prolonged IV treatment (69 [14.3%] vs 30 [6.9%]). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9.1% (95% CI, 6.7%-11.6%) for the early-switch group and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.8%) for the group receiving prolonged IV treatment; the RD was -2.5% (95% CI, -5.7% to 0.7%) and RR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60–1.10). In the per-protocol analysis, the RD was -0.1% (95% CI, -3.4% to 3.1%) and RR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.70–1.40).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, early transition to oral antibiotics within 4 days of initial blood culture was associated with 90-day all-cause mortality risk comparable to that of continuing IV antibiotic treatment and may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV treatment.

### Cefuroxime sodium [^117Ej6X2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult dosage range for Cefuroxime for Injection is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days. In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, disseminated gonococcal infections, and uncomplicated pneumonia, a 750-mg dose every 8 hours is recommended. In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended.

In bone and joint infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to therapy with Cefuroxime for Injection. A course of oral antibiotics was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of Cefuroxime for Injection.

In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid. For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.

For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended.

### A phase 3 study of the safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate in patients [^116vkSqU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Participants were randomized 3:1 to tedizolid phosphate (IV and/or oral) for 6–10 days or an allowed comparator (IV and/or oral) for 10–14 days.

Allowed IV comparators were vancomycin, linezolid (outside the EU only; linezolid is not approved for pediatric use in the EU), clindamycin, flucloxacillin, and cefazolin. Allowed oral comparators were linezolid (outside the EU), clindamycin, flucloxacillin, and cefalexin. Comparators were administered according to local clinical practice.

Tedizolid phosphate dosing was determined as follows, based on participant body weight, regardless of age ≥ 50 kg, once-daily 200 mg dose; ≥ 30 to < 50 kg, 2 mg/kg once every 12 hours (q12h); and 3.2 to < 30 kg, 2.5 mg/kg q12h. Dosing for participants weighing < 3.2 kg was not specified, as cohort 4 was not opened. Dosage strength was the same regardless of administration route, as tedizolid phosphate has approximately 91% bioavailability. Treatment duration could be extended to a maximum of 10 days for tedizolid phosphate, or 14 days for comparators, if clinically indicated, based on blinded investigator assessments at visit 4 (day 5 or 6) and or visit 5 (day 10 ± 1).

Whether participants received IV or oral therapy was determined at the discretion of the investigator; however, per the protocol, ≥ 50% of participants were required to receive ≥ 24 hours of IV therapy, to enable the collection of adequate IV pharmacokinetic (PK) samples to support population PK modeling. Participants who initially received IV therapy could be switched to oral therapy ≥ 24 hours after the first IV dose.

### Transition to oral antibiotic therapy for hospitalized adults with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections [^113ejiMK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Among 4581 episodes with GN-BSI across the 24 sites, the median (IQR) age of patients was 67 years (IQR, 55–77 years) (IV: median, 67 years [IQR, 54–77 years] and oral: median, 67 years [IQR, 55–76 years]; p = 0.26), there were 2389 men (52.2%) and 2192 women (47.8%), and the study cohort included 210 Asian individuals (4.6%), 1046 Black individuals (22.8%), 574 Hispanic individuals (12.5%), and 2513 White individuals (54.9%) (Table 1). There were 264 episodes of GN-BSI excluded because these patients had died or entered hospice within 72 hours of GN-BSI onset. The IV therapy cohort included more men (1463 of 2612 [56.0%] vs 926 of 1969 [47.0%]; P < .001) and a greater proportion of Black patients (642 of 2612 [24.6%] vs 404 of 1969 [20.5%]; p = 0.001) compared with the oral therapy cohort. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2 (IQR, 0–3) in the oral group and 2 (IQR, 1–4) in the IV group (P < .001). A total of 1969 patients (43.0%) cases transitioned to oral antibiotics by day 7. The median day of oral transition was 5 (IQR, 4–6 days).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^113k6hND]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Instrumented lumbar spinal fusion antibiotic duration trial (prospective, randomized, controlled) — Two hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized to preoperative only versus preoperative with extended postoperative antibiotic protocols; patients in the preoperative only protocol group received a single dose of intravenous cefazolin 1 g or 2 g based on weight 30 minutes before incision, while the extended protocol added postoperative intravenous cefazolin every eight hours for three days followed by oral cephalexin every six hours for seven days. Because of protocol deviations or reactions, 36 of the 269 patients were eliminated, leaving 233 who completed the study: 117 receiving preoperative antibiotics only and 116 receiving pre- and postoperative antibiotics; at 21 days of follow-up there was no significant difference in infection rates, with postoperative infection rates 3% overall, 4.3% for the preoperative only protocol and 1.7% for the preoperative with extended antibiotic protocol; the authors suggested that 700 patients per group were needed to prove statistical superiority or equivalency, and concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis can be discontinued within 24 hours with no significant change in infection rate, with this potential Level II study providing Level III therapeutic evidence.

### Transition to oral antibiotic therapy for hospitalized adults with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections [^1167m8Wa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Objectives and Design

The primary objective of this cohort study was to characterize the current practice of timing and frequency of transitioning from IV to oral therapy by day 7 among adult patients hospitalized with GN-BSIs. The secondary objective was to compare demographic characteristics, clinical parameters, host factors, sources of infection, and antibiotic selection between the oral transition and IV therapy groups. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions with data use agreements in place with Johns Hopkins University. Patient consent waivers were granted as the study was retrospective and did not involve direct patient interaction. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline was followed.

Patients age 18 years or older hospitalized with GN-BSI between January 1 and December 31, 2019, at any of 24 US hospitals were included. Hospitals included a geographically diverse mix of academic (n = 16), community (n = 4), and Veterans Affairs medical centers (n = 4). The specific gram-negative organisms included are listed in Table 1. Subsequent GN-BSIs from the same patient were included if they occurred more than 90 days from the index infection. Patients who died or entered hospice within 72 hours of GN-BSI onset may not have had the opportunity to transition to oral therapy and were excluded.

Table 1.
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Gram-Negative Bloodstream Infection Transitioned to Oral Antibiotic Therapy vs Continued Intravenous Antibiotics

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); ESBL, extended-spectrum β-lactamase; NA, not applicable.

Day 1 was defined as the date of collection of the first positive blood culture result. Patients given oral therapy by day 7 were included in the oral transition group. Patients maintained on IV therapy as of day 7 were included in the IV therapy group. From these 2 groups, baseline characteristics and clinical variables were assessed. The prevalence of oral transition was defined as GN-BSI episodes that had transition to oral therapy by day 7. This time limit for evaluating patients' transition to oral therapy was chosen given evidence favoring the duration of only 7 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated GN-BSIs. Additional antibiotic therapy after day 7, regardless of whether IV or oral, was deemed unlikely to be associated with an incremental clinical benefit, based on the results of multiple studies and expert opinion.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^111SBBDq]. Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery prophylaxis with cefazolin — continuous infusion and dose strategies in morbid obesity: Standard single-infusion (SI) cefazolin 2 g at incision may fail to provide adequate tissue concentrations in obese patients, and after a bolus 2 g induction dose followed by continuous infusion (CI) 1 g, patients with a normal BMI had higher adipose-tissue cefazolin concentrations than those with BMI ≥ 40kg/m2; in 89 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses, surgical site infection rates were 4.16%, 1.98%, and 1.55% (p > 0.05) for two 3 g ampicillin/sulbactam doses, a single 1 g ertapenem dose, or 2 g cefazolin at induction plus CI cefazolin 1 g throughout the procedure, respectively; a population PK study of 117 morbidly obese patients (mean BMI 46.95 kg/m2) treated with 4 g cefazolin before gastrectomy found that a 3 g loading dose followed by CI 1 g/h achieved 90% PTA for MIC 4 mg/L until 4 h after loading, and concluded that in some bariatric surgeries an initial 4 g dose was sufficient, but for extended surgeries, CI should be considered.

### Intravenous to oral antibiotic switch therapy among patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^1142ENtf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospital admissions and antimicrobial use. Clinical practice guidelines recommend switching from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics once patients are clinically stable.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted with CAP and initially treated with IV antibiotics at 642 US hospitals from 2010 through 2015. Switching was defined as discontinuation of IV and initiation of oral antibiotics without interrupting therapy. Patients switched by hospital day 3 were considered early switchers. We compared length of stay (LOS), in-hospital 14-day mortality, late deterioration (intensive care unit [ICU] transfer), and hospital costs between early switchers and others, controlling for hospital characteristics, patient demographics, comorbidities, initial treatments, and predicted mortality.

Results

Of 378 041 CAP patients, 21 784 (6%) were switched early, most frequently to fluoroquinolones. Patients switched early had fewer days on IV antibiotics, shorter duration of inpatient antibiotic treatment, shorter LOS, and lower hospitalization costs, but no significant excesses in 14-day in-hospital mortality or late ICU admission. Patients at a higher mortality risk were less likely to be switched. However, even in hospitals with relatively high switch rates, < 15% of very low-risk patients were switched early.

Conclusions

Although early switching was not associated with worse outcomes and was associated with shorter LOS and fewer days on antibiotics, it occurred infrequently. Even in hospitals with high switch rates, < 15% of very low-risk patients were switched early. Our findings suggest that many more patients could be switched early without compromising outcomes.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Transition to oral antibiotic therapy for hospitalized adults with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections [^114BBNi3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Management of gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSIs) with oral antibiotics is highly variable.

Objective

To examine the transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics, including selection, timing, and associated clinical and microbial characteristics, among hospitalized patients with GN-BSIs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 4581 hospitalized adults with GN-BSIs at 24 US hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2019. Patients were excluded if they died within 72 hours. Patients were excluded from the oral therapy group if transition occurred after day 7. Statistical analysis was conducted from July 2022 to October 2023.

Exposures

Administration of antibiotics for GN-BSIs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Baseline characteristics and clinical parameters reflecting severity of illness were evaluated in groups receiving oral and IV therapy. The prevalence of transition from IV to oral antibiotics by day 7, median day of transition, sources of infection, and oral antibiotic selection were assessed.

Results

Of a total of 4581 episodes with GN-BSIs (median age, 67 years [IQR, 55–77 years]; 2389 men [52.2%]), 1969 patients (43.0%) receiving IV antibiotics were transitioned to oral antibiotics by day 7. Patients maintained on IV therapy were more likely than those transitioned to oral therapy to be immunosuppressed (833 of 2612 [31.9%] vs 485 of 1969 [24.6%]; P < .001), require intensive care unit admission (1033 of 2612 [39.5%] vs 334 of 1969 [17.0%]; P < .001), have fever or hypotension as of day 5 (423 of 2612 [16.2%] vs 49 of 1969 [2.5%]; P < .001), require kidney replacement therapy (280 of 2612 [10.7%] vs 63 of 1969 [3.2%]; P < .001), and less likely to have source control within 7 days (1852 of 2612 [70.9%] vs 1577 of 1969 [80.1%]; P < .001). Transitioning patients from IV to oral therapy by day 7 was highly variable across hospitals, ranging from 25.8% (66 of 256) to 65.9% (27 of 41). A total of 4109 patients (89.7%) achieved clinical stability within 5 days. For the 3429 episodes (74.9%) with successful source control by day 7, the median day of source control was day 2 (IQR, 1–3 days) for the oral group and day 2 (IQR, 1–4 days) for the IV group (P < .001). Common infection sources among patients administered oral therapy were the urinary tract (1277 of 1969 [64.9%]), hepatobiliary (239 of 1969 [12.1%]), and intra-abdominal (194 of 1969 [9.9%]). The median day of oral transition was 5 (IQR, 4–6 days). Total duration of antibiotic treatment was significantly shorter among the oral group than the IV group (median, 11 days [IQR, 9–14 days] vs median, 13 days [IQR, 8–16 days]; P < .001]. Fluoroquinolones (62.2% [1224 of 1969]), followed by β-lactams (28.3% [558 of 1969]) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (11.5% [227 of 1969]), were the most commonly prescribed oral antibiotics.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of 4581 episodes of GN-BSIs, transition to oral antibiotic therapy by day 7 occurred in fewer than half of episodes, principally with fluoroquinolones, although this practice varied significantly between hospitals. There may have been additional opportunities for earlier and more frequent oral antibiotic transitions because most patients demonstrated clinical stability by day 5.

### Safety and efficacy of ceftolozane / tazobactam plus metronidazole versus meropenem from a phase 2, randomized clinical trial in pediatric participants with complicated intra-abdominal infection [^112QoZit]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Participants were stratified and dosed by age group as summarized in Table 1. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. Treatment duration was 5–14 days. Optional open-label oral step-down therapy with a protocol-defined standard-of-care regimen was permitted after 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy. Recommended oral step-down therapy options included β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, second- or third-generation cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, or quinolones (if ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin were chosen, it was to be used in combination with metronidazole), with choice of therapy guided by culture results and based on local antibacterial susceptibility patterns.

TABLE 1.
Summary of Dosing and Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule by Age Cohort

Specimen Collection

Details regarding specimen collection and pathogen characterization are provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1. Briefly, specimens were collected at the beginning of the interventional procedure before debridement, removal or disinfection of the primary infection site. Culture of the intra-abdominal specimen, isolation of pathogen(s), initial identification of pathogen(s) and susceptibility testing were conducted by local laboratories. Isolates were submitted to a central laboratory for identification and evaluation of antibacterial susceptibility profiles using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference testing methodology and quality control recommendations. Isolates that displayed predefined minimum inhibitory concentration criteria were screened for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes.

Assessments and End Points

Clinical and microbiologic assessments were performed at the end of the IV treatment visit, which was scheduled < 24 hours after the last IV dose of therapy, the end of treatment (EOT) visit, which was scheduled < 48 hours after the last dose of oral step-down therapy (if applicable), and the test of cure (TOC) visit, which occurred 7–14 days after the last dose of study treatment. The EOT visit only applied to those participants who were switched to oral step-down therapy.

The primary end points were rates of AEs and changes in laboratory values and vital signs from the first dose of study treatment through the last follow-up visit (21–28 days after the last dose) in all participants of the treated population. Key secondary end points were clinical success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had a clinical response of cure, and per-participant microbiologic success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had microbiologic eradication or presumed eradication (defined in Supplemental Digital Content 1,) of all baseline pathogens.

### Association of 30-day mortality with oral step-down vs continued intravenous therapy in patients hospitalized with enterobacteriaceae bacteremia [^112qUPjp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Conversion to oral therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia has the potential to improve the quality of life of patients by improving mobility, eliminating catheter-associated discomfort, decreasing the risk for noninfectious and infectious catheter-associated adverse events, and decreasing health care costs.

Objective

To compare the association of 30-day mortality with early oral step-down therapy vs continued parenteral therapy for the treatment of Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective multicenter cohort study included a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort of 4967 unique patients hospitalized with monomicrobial Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infection at 3 academic medical centers from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014. Eligibility criteria included appropriate source control measures, appropriate clinical response by day 5, active antibiotic therapy from day 1 until discontinuation of therapy, availability of an active oral antibiotic option, and ability to consume other oral medications or feeding. Statistical analysis was performed from March 2, 2018, to June 2, 2018.

Exposures

Oral step-down therapy within the first 5 days of treatment of Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality.

Results

Of the 2161 eligible patients, 1185 (54.8%) were male and 1075 (49.7%) were white; the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 59 (48–68) years. One-to-one propensity-score matching yielded 1478 patients, with 739 in each study arm. Sources of bacteremia included urine (594 patients [40.2%]), gastrointestinal tract (297 [20.1%]), central line-associated (272 [18.4%]), pulmonary (58 [3.9%]), and skin and soft tissue (41 [2.8%]). There were 97 (13.1%) deaths in the oral step-down group and 99 (13.4%) in the intravenous (IV) group within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30). There were no differences in recurrence of bacteremia within 30 days between the groups (IV, 6 [0.8%]; oral, 4 [0.5%]; HR, 0.82 [0.33–2.01]). Patients transitioned to oral step-down therapy were discharged from the hospital an average of 2 days (IQR, 1–6) sooner than patients who continued to receive IV therapy (5 days [IQR, 3–8 days] vs 7 days [IQR, 4–14 days]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, 30-day mortality was not different among hospitalized patients who received oral step-down vs continued parenteral therapy for the treatment of Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections. The findings suggest that transitioning to oral step-down therapy may be an effective treatment approach for patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who have received source control and demonstrated an appropriate clinical response. Early transition to oral step-down therapy may be associated with a decrease in the duration of hospital stay for patients with Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^1118zurZ]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Instrumented lumbar spinal fusion — randomized trial evidence reports that two hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized to either a preoperative only protocol or preoperative with extended postoperative antibiotics; patients in the preoperative only group received a single dose of intravenous cefazolin 1 g or 2 g based on weight 30 minutes before incision, and the extended protocol added postoperative intravenous cefazolin every eight hours for three days followed by oral cephalexin every six hours for seven days. Because 36 of the 269 patients were eliminated, 233 completed the study (117 preoperative only; 116 pre- and postoperative), and at 21 days follow-up there was no significant difference in infection rates between protocols, with postoperative infection rates of 4.3% versus 1.7% and an overall postoperative infection rate of 3%.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^114cnFou]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Two patients redeveloped fever under the use of fosfomycin, which resolved after the switch to intravenous cefuroxime and amoxicillin, respectively. These failures may be attributable to the relatively low fosfomycin plasma levels that are reached after the oral use of 3g fosfomycin. It is unclear to what extent plasma and/or urine levels are decisive for efficacy in the step-down treatment of fUTIs. Higher oral doses up to 6–12g per day are expected to be needed for the empiric treatment of systemic infections. We decided to dose fosfomycin at 3g every 24 hours because we anticipated that higher doses would not be tolerated. We considered this dose to be safe, bearing in mind that fosfomycin is prescribed intravenously in doses up to 24g per day. Noninferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin suggests that either the achievement of high concentrations in urine is sufficient or that the added value of step-down treatment for fUTIs is questionable. However, according to current standards, the 3.3 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment in our trial is too short for treatment of fUTIs, justifying an oral step-down treatment.

Fosfomycin was more frequently associated with gastrointestinal AEs than ciprofloxacin, most notably diarrhea. Yet, this did not result in more frequent discontinuation of fosfomycin. In another study, healthy patients less frequently experienced diarrhea when fosfomycin (3g) was dosed every 48 hours instead of every 24 hours. It remains to be determined if fosfomycin every 48 hours is also efficacious for this indication.

The strengths of this study are the double-blind design with the use of a double-dummy placebo, which diminishes the risk of information bias. Second, the high percentage of patients with bacteremia illustrates that patients were seriously ill with an evident indication for IV and oral step-down antimicrobial treatment. Third, AEs were queried with a diary, which provided a complete picture of the safety and tolerability of multidose fosfomycin. Last, the research was conducted in hospitals of various sizes, both academic and regional hospitals, and the variety of patients and empirical antibiotic regimens was large, which benefits the generalizability.

### Intravenous to oral switch in complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia without endovascular infection: a retrospective single-center cohort study [^116vvQCp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 106 patients were included: 45 patients (42.5%) received only IV antibiotics and 61 patients (57.5%) underwent IV-oral switch. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients with prolonged IV antibiotic treatment more often had persistent fever and persistently positive blood cultures.

Median treatment duration in the prolonged IV treatment group was 45 days (interquartile range [IQR], 44; range, 12–356 days) and in the IV-oral switch group was 45 days (IQR, 49; range, 17–149 days) (P = 0.355). IV-oral switch took place after a median of 16 days (IQR, 4; range, 12–19 days) and oral clindamycin was prescribed to 88.5% of patients. Of all patients, 95 (89.6%) received flucloxacillin as first IV antibiotic treatment, of whom 18 patients (17.0%) were switched to cefazolin due to AKI (8; 44.4%), nausea (3; 16.7%), rash (2; 11.1%), phlebitis (1; 5.5%), or other reasons (4; 22.2%). IV-IV antibiotic switch of flucloxacillin to cefazolin occurred more often in the prolonged IV treatment group (28.9% vs 8.2%, respectively; p = 0.011). Three-month follow-up was available in all but 1 surviving patient (99.1%). No relapses were observed (Table 1). Three-month mortality was 13.3% in the prolonged IV group versus 6.6% in the IV-oral switch group (P = 0.242). Median hospital admission duration was 29 days (IQR, 33; range, 9–129 days) in the prolonged IV group and 17 days (IQR, 11; range, 9–67 days) in the IV-oral switch group (P = 0.001).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^112X98xY]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Spine surgery with spinal implants — preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is suggested to decrease infection rates in patients undergoing spine surgery with spinal implants, and the superiority of one agent, dose or route of administration over any other has not been clearly demonstrated; Grade of Recommendation: B. In a randomized controlled trial in instrumented lumbar spinal fusion, the preoperative-only regimen used a single dose of intravenous cefazolin 1 g or 2 g based on weight 30 minutes before incision, whereas the extended postoperative regimen added postoperative intravenous cefazolin every eight hours for three days followed by oral cephalexin every six hours for seven days. Because of protocol deviations or reactions, 36 of the 269 patients were eliminated; 233 completed the study with 117 receiving preoperative antibiotics only and 116 receiving pre- and postoperative antibiotics, and at 21 days follow-up there was no significant difference in infection rates between regimens, with postoperative infection rates 4.3% for the preoperative only protocol and 1.7% for the preoperative with extended antibiotic protocol and an overall postoperative infection rate of 3%. The report notes prolonged postoperative antibiotic dosing increases cost and potential complications and concludes this potential Level II study provides Level III therapeutic evidence that preoperative prophylactic antibiotic use in instrumented lumbar spinal fusion is effective at reducing the risk of infection, while the superiority of one agent or one regimen was not demonstrated; when determining the appropriate drug choice, the patient's risk factors, allergies, length and complexity of the procedure and issues of antibiotic resistance should be considered.

### Clinical pharmacological considerations in an early intravenous to oral antibiotic switch: are barriers real or simply perceived? [^114TGgva]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traditionally, there has been a common belief that ongoing i.v. antibiotic therapy is superior to an early i.v. to oral switch, especially for severe infections. However, this may be at least partly based on early observations rather than robust, high-quality data and contemporary clinical studies. It is important to examine whether these traditional views align with clinical pharmacological considerations, or conversely, if these considerations may support the broader application of an early i.v. to oral switch under appropriate circumstances.

Objectives

To examine the rationale for an early i.v. to oral antibiotic switch in the context of clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and to discuss whether commonly encountered pharmacological barriers are real or simply perceived.

Sources

We conducted PubMed searches on barriers and clinicians' perceptions about an early i.v. to oral switch, clinical studies comparing switching with i.v.-only dosing, and pharmacological factors affecting oral antimicrobials.

Content

We focused on general pharmacological and clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and considerations that are relevant when clinicians ponder whether to switch from i.v. to oral antimicrobial dosing. The main focus of this review was on antibiotics. The discussion of the general principles is accompanied by specific examples from the literature.

Implications

Clinical pharmacological considerations and an imposing and increasing number of clinical studies, including randomized clinical trials, support an early i.v. to oral switch for the treatment of a number of infection types, under appropriate circumstances. We hope that the information provided here will add to calls for a critical examination of the role of i.v. to oral switching for many infections that are currently treated almost exclusively with i.v.-only therapy, and that it will inform health policy and guideline development by infectious diseases organizations.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^116iqQEj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) — oral antibiotic use and IV-to-oral transitions: We recommend ASPs implement programs to increase both appropriate use of oral antibiotics for initial therapy and the timely transition of patients from IV to oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence cited shows cost and length-of-stay benefits; an abbreviated IV cephalosporin course followed by oral cephalosporin had a lower total cost of care ($5002 vs $2953; P < .005) and a shorter hospital stay (10 vs 7 days; p = 0.01), and line complications were lower with switching (17/81 vs 26/81) though not significant (P = 0.077). Early switching on medical wards shortened IV duration (reduction in median days, 19%; 95% CI, 9%–29%; p = 0.001) but only 151 of 246 (61.1%) potential cases were switched, while guideline implementation increased conversions (52/97 [54%] vs 66/80 [83%]; difference, 29%; 95% CI, 16%–42%; P < .001). Another example of benefit is reduction in the need for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT); in 56 patients who received oral (n = 50) or no additional antibiotics (n = 6) after mandatory infectious diseases approval of OPAT, only 1 of 56 patients had clinical failure and there was a per-patient cost savings of $3847.

### A prospective randomized trial to assess oral versus intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of postoperative wound infection after extremity fractures (POvIV study) [^112RL4ZS]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Patients surgically treated for infection after extremity fractures are typically discharged with a 6- to 12-week antibiotic regimen. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are associated with significant cost and potential complications of deep vein thrombosis, line clotting, and sepsis. Many of the pathogens that cause musculoskeletal infection have both oral (PO) and IV antibiotic options with adequate bioavailability and antibacterial effect, yet IV antibiotics remain the standard of care absent evidence that PO options are clinically as efficacious. The POvIV study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to compare PO with IV antibiotic therapy in patients with postoperative wound infections after extremity fractures. Patients between the ages of 18 and 84 who have a culture-positive surgical site infection after internal fixation for fracture repair or arthrodesis are approached for this study, and if they provide consent, are randomly assigned to receive either PO or IV antibiotics. Antibiotic selection is based on culture and sensitivity results. Randomization determines the route of administration. Patients are followed for 1 year after study enrollment. This study will be the largest prospective randomized trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PO antibiotic use for treatment of postoperative wound infections. Results will inform clinician decisions on antibiotic delivery in patients with postoperative wound infections.

Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Obesity and β-lactam infusion strategies — summary and research needs: Based on population PK studies and simulations, PI may overcome some of the effects of body weight on β-lactam concentrations, and for gastric bypass prophylaxis, use of CI with larger cefazolin doses (> 2 g) may help ensure adequate tissue concentrations; however, no studies demonstrate the superiority of PI versus SI β-lactam dosing in obese patients regarding clinical outcomes. The authors note that the use of PIs may be a reliable approach to improve fT > MIC and ensure adequate serum concentrations in obese patients, but larger-than-standard doses are often also needed.

### Once-daily intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid is equivalent to once-daily intravenous ceftriaxone plus oral placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults [^111PYxkM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A once-daily regimen of cefazolin (2 g intravenously [iv]) plus probenecid (1 g by mouth) was compared with a once-daily regimen of ceftriaxone (1 g iv) plus oral placebo in a randomized, double-blind equivalence trial of home-based therapy for moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults. For the assessable recipients of cefazolin-probenecid (n = 59) and ceftriaxone-placebo (n = 57), clinical cure occurred at the end of treatment in 86% and 96% (P = 0.11), respectively, and was maintained at 1 month of follow-up in 96% and 91% (P = 0.55), respectively. The mean number of treatment doses (± standard deviation) given was similar in the 2 treatment arms (6.97 ± 2.6 for cefazolin-probenecid and 6.12 ± 2.1 for ceftriaxone-placebo; p = 0.06). The median antibiotic trough concentrations were 2.35 microgram/mL for cefazolin and 15.45 microgram/mL for ceftriaxone. Patients in the 2 treatment arms were similar with regard to overall rates of adverse reaction (P = 0.15), but nausea was more common among those in the cefazolin-probenecid arm (P = 0.048). The once-daily regimen of cefazolin-probenecid is a cheap, practical, and effective treatment option for moderate-to-severe cellulitis, and it avoids the need to use third-generation cephalosporins in most patients.

Conclusion

While no statistically significant difference in SSI prevalence was observed in non-obese and obese patients, or those who weighed above and below 120 kg, who received a 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose, trends toward an increase were evident. There is a clear need for large-scale randomised controlled trials to examine whether a 2-g or 3-g cefazolin dose is adequate to prevent SSI in obese individuals.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^116vT8Jq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria included hospitalization, age of 18 years or older, growth of gram-negative bacteria on blood culture, and evidence of infection. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment had to be initiated within 24 hours of the first blood culture. Participants had to be clinically stable within 4 days of the initial blood culture (temperature ≤ 37.8 °C, systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, heart rate < 100/min, respiratory rate < 24/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation > 90%), with an available susceptibility report on day 4. Individuals who were immunosuppressed (receiving corticosteroid treatment with ≥ 20 mg of prednisolone equivalent per day for > 14 days, HIV positive, having received chemotherapy for < 28 days, neutropenia [< 1000 /μL], organ transplant recipient, or receiving biological response modifier therapy), transitioned to hospice care within 4 days of the initial blood culture, had an established uncontrolled focus of infection, or had a blood culture with polymicrobial growth or growth of either Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Brucella, or Fusobacterium species were excluded. Additionally, individuals who ended antibiotic treatment before or on the index date were excluded.

Treatment Strategy and Assignment

Early switch to oral antibiotics was defined as transitioning to oral antibiotic therapy within 4 days of blood culture. Prolonged IV treatment was defined as a minimum of 5 days of IV antibiotic treatment.

The index date was set to 4 days after the initial blood culture, mimicking the time of randomization in the target trial. Participants were allocated into 1 of the 2 treatment groups according to the antibiotic treatment strategy with which their data were compatible at the index date.

Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was defined as initiation of either piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin in combination with gentamicin, mecillinam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem, ertapenem, or tobramycin. Choice of IV and oral antibiotic agent after availability of the susceptibility report was at the discretion of the treating physician but had to comply with the susceptibility result. Antibiotic treatment had to be maintained for 7 to 14 days.

Follow-Up and Outcomes

Follow-up started at randomization and ended on day 90 or at the time of death, whichever occurred first. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality.

BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Design

The methodology for this study has been published elsewhere. Briefly, all adult patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of CAP by their attending physicians were prospectively identified and followed by the AS programme. CAP was defined as a lower respiratory tract infection in a patient who had not had any previous hospitalisation of ≥ 48 consecutive hours in the prior 3-month period.

Audit and feedback were the primary AS intervention used throughout the study. Basically, the AS team identified patients with CAP, collected data prospectively, and audited patients Monday to Friday starting at ≥ 48 hours after admission if patients met the following criteria: (1) were admitted to a ward, and (2) were receiving any intravenous antibiotics ≥ 48 hours, or were receiving any oral fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin), oral quinolone (ciprofloxacin) or oral cephalosporin (cefprozil or cefuroxime) for ≥ 48 hours, or were receiving ≥ 5 days of any antibiotic. The AS team then made recommendations to the attending physician; these were documented in the electronic medical record, along with documenting the recommendations in the physician order section of the patient's paper chart as suggestions that required attending physician agreement and sign-off prior to implementation, and direct verbal communication with the attending physician whenever possible or deemed necessary. Agreement was considered to have occurred if the attending physician signed off on the AS recommendations within 24 hours. The AS recommendations could be any one or more of the following: (1) no change to current therapy, (2) intravenous to oral conversion, (3) discontinue antibiotic therapy, (4) change in duration or dose, and (5) de-escalation or escalation of antibiotic therapy. These recommendations were not mutually exclusive, and it was common for the AS team to make more than one recommendation for the same patient.

### Switch to oral antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteraemia: a randomized, open-label, clinical trial [^115paXq3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching from intravenous (IV) to oral antimicrobial therapy in patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia, after completion of 3–5 days of microbiologically active IV therapy.

Methods

A multicentre, open-label, randomized trial of adults with monomicrobial Enterobacterales bacteraemia caused by a strain susceptible to ≥ 1 oral beta-lactam, quinolone, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Inclusion criteria included completion of 3–5 days of microbiologically active IV therapy, being afebrile and haemodynamically stable for ≥ 48 hours, and absence of an uncontrolled source of infection. Pregnancy, endocarditis, and neurological infections were exclusion criteria. Randomization, stratified by urinary source of bacteraemia, was to continue IV (IV Group) or to switch to oral therapy (Oral Group). Agents and duration of therapy were determined by the treating physicians. The primary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as death, need for additional antimicrobial therapy, microbiological relapse, or infection-related re-admission within 90 days. Non-inferiority threshold was set at 10% in the 95% CI for the difference in the proportion with treatment failure between the Oral and IV Groups in the modified intention-to-treat population. The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04146922).

In the modified intention-to-treat population, treatment failure occurred in 21 of 82 (25.6%) in the IV Group, and 18 of 83 (21.7%) in the Oral Group (risk difference -3.7%, 95% CI -16.6% to 9.2%). The proportions of subjects with any adverse events (AE), serious AE, or AE leading to treatment discontinuation were comparable.

Discussion

In patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia, oral switch, after initial IV antimicrobial therapy, clinical stability, and source control, is non-inferior to continuing IV therapy.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

In this cohort study, we specified a hypothetical target trial, drawing inspiration from the INVEST trial protocol, assigning individuals with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia to 1 of 2 treatment arms. One arm was assigned to early transition to oral antibiotics at day 4 after the initial blood culture collection by continuing oral therapy or switching to oral therapy without reinitiating IV antibiotic therapy. The other arm was assigned to continuation of IV antibiotics for a minimum of 24 hours after treatment assignment. Table 1 summarizes the protocol components. The hypothetical target trial was then emulated using observational data. Patients were identified by a blood culture positive for growth of gram-negative bacteria from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. Informed consent was waived by the Centre for Regional Development because it is not required for register-based studies according to Danish law. The study was reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Oral cephalexin population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis in infants 7–60 Days old [^116KGCv2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data to guide oral antibiotic dosing in neonates and young infants, particularly for intravenous (IV) to oral transition. Cephalexin is a promising oral treatment for neonatal pathogens, including Enterobacterales and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). However, maturational changes in gastrointestinal absorption and kidney function during early infancy complicate extrapolation of dosing from older populations. We evaluated cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and simulated dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in infants ≤ 60 days old.

Methods

This prospective, single-center study enrolled infants 0–60 days receiving cephalexin either as part of routine clinical care or as a single 25 mg/kg study dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Simulations assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for free time above MIC (fT > MIC) for ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% of the dosing interval across MICs 1–16 mg/L, assuming 10% protein binding. We also simulated the cumulative fractional response (CFR) using typical MIC distributions for Enterobacterales and MSSA.

Results

The analysis included 144 samples from 33 infants with median post-natal age 31 days (range 9–56) and median gestational age 37 weeks (range 29–41). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time best described the data. Weight influenced apparent volume of distribution and apparent clearance. Additionally, we identified a maturational effect on absorption rate using post-natal age and on apparent clearance using post-menstrual age. For Enterobacterales, 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours achieved > 90% CFR for a 50% fT > MIC target. For MSSA, 25 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours was sufficient. Higher or more frequent dosing was required to meet the more stringent 70% fT > MIC target.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin can achieve necessary PD targets in infants 7–60 days old. These findings support the use of model-informed dosing strategies to guide safe and effective oral antibiotic use in early infancy, including for IV-to-oral transition.

### Transition from intravenous to oral antimicrobial therapy in patients with uncomplicated and complicated bloodstream infections [^115yKuom]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of oral antimicrobial agents in the management of bloodstream infections (BSI) is currently evolving.

Objectives

This narrative review summarizes and appraises clinical studies that examined transition from intravenous to oral antimicrobials or compared effectiveness of various oral agents for definitive therapy of uncomplicated and complicated BSI in adults.

Sources

Relevant English-language studies from MEDLINE (since inception) and presented abstracts at international scientific meetings (since 2017).

Content

Emerging data suggest potential utility of oral switch strategy, particularly to oxazolidinones, as an alternative to standard intravenous therapy in low-risk patients with uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus BSI. Moreover, results of recent randomized clinical trials are promising that combination oral regimens may play a role in antimicrobial management of complicated Gram-positive BSI, including infective endocarditis, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Whereas oral fluoroquinolones have been used successfully for decades in both uncomplicated and complicated Gram-negative BSI, recent studies suggest that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and aminopenicillins represent alternative oral options in uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae BSI. Oral azoles have been used for definitive therapy of Candida species BSI and are currently recommended by the international management guidelines.

Implications

Recent studies demonstrate that early transition from intravenous to oral therapy is a feasible and effective strategy in most patients with BSI due to Gram-negative bacteria, obligate anaerobic bacteria and Candida species. Oral antimicrobial combinations may be considered in select patients with complicated Gram-positive BSI after 10–14 days of intravenous therapy. Future studies will determine the role of oral agents for switch therapy in uncomplicated Gram-positive BSI.

Erysipelas

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by Streptococcus spp. usually S. pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas.

Erysipelas is distinguished clinically from cellulitis by the following two features:
In erysipelas the lesions are raised above the level of the surrounding skin, and
Erysipelas is characterized by a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue.

Streptococci are the primary cause. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

Treatment
Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days
Use intravenous antibiotics if signs of systemic inflammation

Empiric antibiotic regimens. Normal renal function
Target Pathogens: S. aureus and streptococci, CA-MRSA is unusual.

Outpatient therapy or step down
One of the following oral antibiotics
Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 h

### Cefazolin sodium [^1128qv2L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cefazolin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for cefazolin has not been evaluated in patients.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of cefazolin to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1 gram dose.

The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration.

In a study of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg) in healthy volunteers, cefazolin serum concentrations at the third hour were approximately 28 mcg/mL.

Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in healthy volunteers (N = 12) following a single 15-minute IV infusion of 2 grams of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection are summarized in Table 7.

N = number of subjects observed; Cmax = maximum plasma concentration; Tmax = time to maximum plasma concentration; AUC0-inf = area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity; t1/2 = apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life; CL = total clearance; Vz = volume of distribution

### Cefotaxime [^112zFXRV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of this Pharmacy Bulk Package is for the preparation of solutions for intravenous infusion only.

Adults

Dosage and route of administration should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of the infection, and the condition of the patient (see table for dosage guideline). Cefotaxime may be administered IV after reconstitution. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefotaxime sodium has no activity against this organism.

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, the recommended dose is a single 1 gram IV administered 30 to 90 minutes prior to start of surgery.

Cesarean Section Patients

The first dose of 1 gram is administered intravenously as soon as the umbilical cord is clamped. The second and third doses should be given as 1 gram intravenously at 6 and 12 hours after the first dose.

Neonates, Infants, and Children

The following dosage schedule is recommended:

Neonates (birth to 1 month):

0–1 week of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours IV

1–4 weeks of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours IV

It is not necessary to differentiate between premature and normal-gestational age infants.

Infants and Children (1 month to 12 years):

For body weights less than 50 kg, the recommended daily dose is 50 to 180 mg/kg IV body weight divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections, including meningitis. For body weights 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used; the maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

Geriatric Use

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS, General and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .)

### Pharmacodynamic considerations for the selection of oral cephalosporins in the treatment of rhinosinusitis [^1118eoDu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The elimination of an infection occurs when the antibiotic reaches the site of the pathogen in adequate concentrations for an appropriate length of time. To predict whether an antibiotic will achieve this goal, one must have a familiarity with pharmacodynamic concepts that integrate the drug's microbiological activity, its pharmacokinetic properties, and its mode of bacterial killing. For the cephalosporins, it is the time or duration that the concentrations in serum or interstitial fluid remain above their mean inhibitory concentration for the pathogen that best correlates with clinical outcomes. The application of this pharmacodynamic profile can assist in the decision process to distinguish one oral cephalosporin from another and, therefore, provides an opportunity for maximizing the probability of good clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for the selection of resistance.

Oral antibiotics and IV-to-oral transition in antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) — We recommend ASPs implement programs to increase both appropriate use of oral antibiotics for initial therapy and the timely transition of patients from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Such programs can reduce costs and length of hospital stay, and ASPs should implement strategies to assess patients who can safely complete therapy with an oral regimen to reduce the need for IV catheters and to avoid outpatient parenteral therapy.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

MSSA acute bacterial arthritis antimicrobial choice and cephalexin dosing — For children with ABA caused by MSSA, a beta-lactam agent is preferred for initial parenteral treatment (cefazolin, nafcillin or oxacillin) and for definitive oral treatment (cephalexin). "High dose" cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) was first studied and remains adequate as convalescent therapy following initial parenteral therapy and surgical management. Modeling using a pharmacodynamic driver of 40% T > MIC suggests higher doses may be required for strains with MICs of 2 and 4 mg/L, and the MIC90 for MSSA is 4–8 mg/L, suggesting oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy, surgical debridement, and clinical response. The higher doses (120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours) needed to achieve this target in 100%, 90% and 80% of children for MSSA with MICs of 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively, do not appear necessary for good outcomes after oral transition. Using the same target, proposed cephalexin dosages (administered Q8H) are 45 mg/kg/day for MSSA with an MIC of 1 mg/L; 75 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 2 mg/L; and 135 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 4 mg/L, with those doses proposed for children weighing 10–15 kg.

Because of untreated drug reaction or deviation from protocol, 36 of the 269 patients were eliminated, leaving 233 completing the study (117 preoperative only, 116 pre- and postoperative). At 21 days follow-up, there was no significant difference in infection rates; postoperative infection rates were 4.3% for the preoperative only protocol and 1.7% for the preoperative with extended antibiotic protocol, with an overall postoperative infection rate of 3%.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^116oPJMX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is equally efficacious as but more cost-effective than triple agent therapy. It was reported that dual therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and metronidazole only offers a more efficient and cost-effective antibiotic management compared with triple therapy, but prospective studies are required to determine whether this policy is associated with higher rates of wound infections and change in antibiotic therapy.

Postoperative antibiotics can be administered orally if the patient is otherwise well enough to be discharged. Arnold et al. conducted a RCT of 82 pediatric patients to compare the effect of home intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy on complication rates and resource utilization following appendectomy for perforated AA. Fosrty-four patients (54%) were randomized to the IV group and 38 (46%) to the oral group. The study showed no difference in length of stay (4.4 ± 1.5 versus 4.4 ± 2.0 days), postoperative abscess rate (11.6% vs 8.1%), or readmission rate (14.0% vs 16.2%), whereas hospital and outpatient charges were higher in the IV group.

Other retrospective cohort studies have confirmed that after apspendectomy for perforated AA in children, oral antibiotics show equivalent outcomes compared with intravenous antibiotics, but with shorter length of hospitalizations and less medical encounters required.

Compared to pediatric patients who receive intravenous antibiotics, those who are treated with oral antibiotics have statistically lower rates of repeated US imaging (49.6% vs 35.1%) and PICC placement (98.3% vs 9.1%), whereas the rates of IAA are similar (20.9% vs 16.0%). Moreover, early transition to oral antibiotics allows shorter hospital times and decreased hospital charges, with similar total antibiotic days and readmission rate.

Statement 7.3 Administering postoperative antibiotics orally in children with complicated appendicitis for periods shorter than 7 days postoperatively seems to be safe and it is not associated with increased risk of complications. Early transition to oral antibiotics is safe, effective, and cost-efficient in the treatment of complicated appendicitis in the child. Recommendation 7.3 We recommend early switch (after 48 h) to oral administration of postoperative antibiotics in children with complicated appendicitis, with an overall length of therapy shorter than seven days [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong; 1B].

Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics among participants in the usual care and pathway periods were similar (Table 1). Among all 309 participants in the study population, 64% were male. Median age was 47.5 (IQR = 32.0 to 58.5) years for participants on usual care and 46.0 (IQR = 33.0 to 58.0) years on the clinical pathway. Median infection area was 255.0 (IQR = 150.0 to 500.0) cm 2 for participants on usual care and 289.0 (IQR = 161.3 to 555.0) cm 2 on the clinical pathway. Overall, 58 (18.8%) participants exhibited two or more SIRS criteria. Diabetes was the most common comorbidity and was present in 18.8% of participants in each group. The most common type of infection was cellulitis, diagnosed in 81.9% of participants.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of participants treated preimplementation and postimplementation of a SSTI clinical pathway

Of 149 participants receiving usual care and having antibiotic data available, 41 (27.5%) were initially treated with an IV antibiotic in the ED prior to discharge, with 39 of these 41 participants discharged on oral antibiotics. Of 89 participants discharged from the ED, 47 (52.8%) received only oral antibiotics. One participant was treated with antibiotic ointment and received neither IV nor oral antibiotics. The most common IV antibiotics given in the ED were vancomycin (42.3%), cefazolin (21.2%), and ceftriaxone (10.3%), and the most common oral antibiotics prescribed were cephalexin (38.5%), clindamycin (35.3%), trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (30.1%), and doxycycline (9.6%). Of 153 participants on the clinical pathway, 152 (99.3%) were initially treated with IV dalbavancin administered in the ED (one participant received dalbavancin after ED discharge). Of these participants, 46 (30.0%) were also given oral antibiotics at the time of ED discharge. The most common oral antibiotics prescribed were cephalexin (13.1%), trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (13.1%), and clindamycin (5.9%).

### Factors influencing the use of highly bioavailable oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections [^112Sc44G]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) is an academic health sciences center located in Toronto, Canada where over 6000 orthopedic surgeries are performed annually. Evidence supporting the use of highly bioavailable oral antibiotic therapy for PJI was presented to infectious diseases (ID) and orthopedic surgery stakeholders in November 2021. A standardized process for the perioperative management of PJI was developed and implemented in February 2022. This process incorporated practice changes that supported the appropriate use of oral antibiotic therapy. All PJI cases were assessed by ID physicians who provided recommendations on empiric and definitive treatment, and appropriateness for transition to highly bioavailable oral therapy. This initiative was focused on improving oral antibiotic therapy for first-episode PJI, in order to help clinicians gain comfort in more straightforward cases of infection.

A retrospective cohort study examining patients with first-episode of PJI at SHSC was conducted from February 1 st, 2022 to January 31 st, 2024. All revision arthroplasty cases during the study period were reviewed to determine the indication for revision. Only revision cases for first-episode PJI were included. For each PJI, the following variables were collected: age, sex, date of the surgery, anatomical site of the prosthesis, revision type (1 stage, 1.5 stage, 2 stage, or debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention), orthopedic surgeon and ID consultant involved, and definitive antibiotic treatment. Based on the duration of IV treatment in the oral versus intravenous antibiotics (OVIVA) for bone and joint infection trial, definitive treatment was defined as the antibiotic prescribed on the 7 th postoperative day. We established this timepoint to identify cases where delays in obtaining susceptibilities were the cause of postponing oral therapy. For all PJI treated with definitive IV therapy, the reason was determined through chart review and grouped into major themes. When it was unclear, the ID consultant involved in the case was interviewed.

The primary outcome was the reason why patients with first-episode of PJI received definitive IV instead of oral antibiotic therapy. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the cohort. Medians and proportions were calculated for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Research ethics review was exempted based on our institutional process which confirmed that the project was deemed improvement in quality and not human subject research.

Observational cohorts — criteria and timing for IV-to-oral transition in pediatric osteoarticular infections including ABA: In France (2009 to 2014), 95 children with confirmed or suspected ABA were followed for at least 2 years; intravenous therapy had a median of 4.5 days (IQR: 4 to 7), median total duration 15 days (IQR: 15 to 17), and 10 (11%) received > 21 days, with none having long term sequelae; etiology was confirmed in 40 (42%) with K. kingae in 18, S. aureus in 11 and S. pyogenes in 7, and transition criteria included receipt of 48 hours of IV therapy, 24 hours without fever, clinical improvement, and CRP < 20 mg/L. In Australia, a prospective two-center cohort of acute pediatric bone and joint infections (n = 70, of which 33 had ABA) evaluated oral transition as early as 3 days of IV therapy, with oral transition in < 4 days for 18 (54%) and < 6 days for 27 (82%); among the full group, CRP > 100 mg/L best predicted use of IV antibiotics for > 5 days (p-value = 0.03), and there were no sequelea at 1 year. A US retrospective series used clinical improvement plus CRP values having fallen to 20 to 30 mg/L (normal ≤ 9 mg/L) as criteria for oral transition in 194 pediatric osteoarticular infections (32 had ABA alone and 49 had osteomyelitis + ABA), among whom ABA-alone etiologies included MSSA 17 (53%) and K. kingae 6 (19%), none had MRSA, and there were no microbiological failures or long-term sequelae.

### Transition to oral antibiotic therapy for hospitalized adults with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections [^11378cuY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the timeline of transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics among patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSIs)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4581 GN-BSI episodes at 24 US hospitals, 43.0% of patients were transitioned to oral antibiotics by day 7; day 5 was the median day of oral transition, most commonly with fluoroquinolones (62.2%). Patients maintained on IV therapy had more severe illness and more comorbidities; however, 89.7% of patients were clinically stable within 5 days and the median day of source control was day 2 for all patients with successful source control by day 7.

Meaning

This study suggests that, for patients with GN-BSIs, fewer than half of patients were transitioned from IV to oral therapy; opportunities exist for earlier and more frequent transitions.

This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections and Sepsis and septic shock. In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of early oral switch in patients with bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacterales? In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 303 patients (124 female, 179 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacterales who achieved clinical stability by day 5. The key exclusion criteria were life expectancy < 30 days; pregnancy or lactation; isolation of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales; severe neutropenia; planned duration of treatment > 28 days. In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 110 early oral switch (switched to oral therapy on day 5) n = 193 continued IV therapy (either switched later or remained on intravenous therapy for full treatment duration). In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinical cure at test of cure (95.4% vs. 91.7%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.1). In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in clinical cure at day 60 (96.3% vs. 84.9%; RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.21) No significant difference in death at day 60 (2.7% vs. 5.2%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07) Significant decrease in the rate of recurrence until day 60 (10.9% vs. 24.3%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.8). In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the SIMPLIFY (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients with bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacterales who achieved clinical stability by day 5, early oral switch was equivalent to continued IV therapy with respect to clinical cure at test of cure.

### Cefuroxime [^113pvCaG]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of the Pharmacy Bulk Package is for the preparation of solutions for intravenous infusion only. Dosing reference to the intramuscular route of administration is for informational purposes only.

Adults:

The usual adult dosage range for Cefuroxime for Injection is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days. In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, disseminated gonococcal infections, and uncomplicated pneumonia, a 750-mg dose every 8 hours is recommended. In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended.

In bone and joint infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to therapy with Cefuroxime for Injection. A course of oral antibiotics was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of Cefuroxime for Injection.

In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid. For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.

For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for cefazolin against Enterobacteriaceae that were published in January 2010 have been revised by the Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, based on the examination of recent data about in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic characteristics and published clinical outcome studies. The new breakpoints, to be formally published in January 2011, have increased the minimum inhibitory concentration interpretive criteria by one 2-fold dilution, linked to an adult dosing schedule of 2 g every 8 h intravenously. Disk diffusion zone diameter correlates, shown to be impossible to define with the January 2010 interpretive criteria, have been able to be set for the new interpretive criteria. Diagnostic laboratories will continue to need to test cephalothin to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporins cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, cephalexin, and loracarbef.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

### A multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline versus comparator in pediatric patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection [^117WEdCV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ceftaroline has in vitro activity against bacterial isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first study to investigate ceftaroline fosamil in pediatric patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs).

Methods

A multicenter, observer-blinded study (NCT01400867) in pediatric patients (2 months-17 years of age) with ABSSSIs. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous (IV) ceftaroline fosamil or IV comparator (vancomycin or cefazolin, plus optional aztreonam) with optional switch to oral antibacterials from Day 4. Safety and clinical outcomes were assessed.

Results

Of 163 enrolled patients, 159 received treatment. Treatment groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. Rates of study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were similar for ceftaroline fosamil [22% (23/106)] and comparator [23% (12/53)]. One serious adverse event, considered to be related to IV study drug, occurred in the ceftaroline fosamil group (hypersensitivity). In both the treatment groups, 85% (ceftaroline fosamil, 91/107 and comparator, 44/52) of the modified intent-to-treat population achieved early clinical response (≥ 20% reduction in infection area from baseline). Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were high [ceftaroline fosamil, 94% (101/107) and comparator, 87% (45/52)]. For patients evaluated 8 to 15 days after the last dose of any antibiotic (IV or oral), from whom methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was initially isolated, a favorable microbiologic response (reflecting the efficacy of oral/IV therapy and capturing a relapse or reinfection) was achieved with ceftaroline fosamil [89% (16/18)] and comparator [57% (4/7)].

Conclusions

Ceftaroline fosamil, with optional oral switch, was as well-tolerated and effective in pediatric patients with ABSSSIs as comparator therapy.

### Early switch to oral antibiotic therapy in patients with low-risk neutropenic sepsis (EASI-SWITCH): a randomized non-inferiority trial [^115BUc61]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether early switch to oral antibiotic treatment in adults with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of complications is non-inferior to switching later.

Methods

This non-inferiority, parallel-group, randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolled UK adults hospitalized with neutropenic sepsis. Participants were randomly assigned to either switch to oral ciprofloxacin plus co-amoxiclav within 12–24 hours or to continue intravenous treatment for at least 48 hours. The primary outcome was a composite measure of treatment failure, 14 days after randomization. The non-inferiority margin was 15%.

Results

There were 129 participants from 16 centres and 125 were assessed for the primary outcome. Of these, 113 patients completed protocolized treatment and comprised the per-protocol population. In total, 9 (14.1%) of 64 patients in the standard care arm met the primary end point, compared with 15 (24.6%) of 61 in the early switch arm, giving a risk difference of 10.5% (1-sided 95% CI, -∞% to 22%; p 0.14). In the per-protocol population, 8 (13.3%) of the 60 patients in the standard care arm met the primary end point, compared with 9 (17%) of 53 in the intervention arm giving a risk difference of 3.7% (one-sided 95% CI, -∞% to 14.8%; p 0.59). Duration of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention arm (median 2 [inter-quartile range (IQR) 2–3] vs. 3 days [IQR 2–4]; p 0.002).

Discussion

Although non-inferiority of early oral switch was found in the per-protocol population, the intervention was not non-inferior in the intent-to-treat population.

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^116wpkJp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

Surgical Infection Society revised guidelines — oral antimicrobial agents as substitutes for IV therapy in IAI: Substitution of oral for IV antibiotic agents in patients with IAI may be considered under selected circumstances. Use selected oral agents with good bioavailability for patients with return of adequate gastrointestinal function and use oral antibiotics only to complete a short course of treatment and not to prolong antimicrobial use beyond current recommendations (Grade 1-B). Consider use of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to complete a short course in adults and children (Grade 2-B), consider oral moxifloxacin for adults (Grade 2-B) but do not use it in children unless no other option is available (Grade 1-B), use oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole for adults (Grade 1-B) and consider it for children if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-C), and consider oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, an oral first-, second-, or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole as options if other oral agents are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cefazolin for Injection USP, Pharmacy Bulk Package bag SmartPak should not be used in patients who require less than a 250 mg dose of Cefazolin.

THIS PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE REQUIRES RECONSTITUTION WITH STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION, USP TO A CONCENTRATION OF 100 mg per mL AND FURTHER DILUTION IN 50 mL OF A COMPATIBLE SOLUTION.

2.1 Adult Population

Cefazolin for Injection USP, Pharmacy Bulk Package bag SmartPak should not be used in patients who require less than a 250 mg dose of Cefazolin.

Cefazolin for Injection should be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP to a concentration of 100 mg per mL and further diluted in 50 mL of a compatible solution. The recommended adult dosages are outlined in Table 1. Cefazolin for Injection should be administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes.

2.2 Perioperative Prophylactic Use

Cefazolin for Injection USP, Pharmacy Bulk Package bag SmartPak should not be used in patients who require less than a 250 mg dose of cefazolin.

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, recommended doses are:

1 gram to 2 grams I.V. administered ½ hour to 1 hour prior to the start of surgery.
For lengthy operative procedures (e.g., 2 hours or more), 500 mg to 1 gram I.V. during surgery (administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure).
500 mg to 1 gram I.V. every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively.

It is important that (i) the preoperative dose be given just (½ to 1 hour) prior to the start of surgery so that adequate antibacterial concentrations are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (ii) cefazolin may be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient concentrations of the antibacterial drug at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms. The prophylactic administration of cefazolin should usually be discontinued within a 24-hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of cefazolin may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^116YSRSK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Of 914 eligible individuals (median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3–83.2 years]; 402 [44.0%] female; 512 [56.0%] male), 433 (47.4%) switched early to oral antibiotic treatment while 481 (52.6%) received prolonged IV treatment (Figure 1). Table 2 details baseline characteristics in the emulated trial. Compared with individuals receiving prolonged IV treatment, individuals switching early to oral antibiotic treatment were younger (median age, 73.0 years [IQR, 60.5–81.6 years] vs 76.0 years [IQR, 66.8–84.6 years]), had fewer comorbidities (median CCI score, 4 [IQR, 2–5] vs 5 [IQR, 3–6]), were more likely to have community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia (387 of 433 [89.4%] vs 389 of 481 [80.9%]) and the urinary tract as the source of the infection (360 of 433 [83.1%] vs 339 of 481 [70.5%]), and had lower median plasma CRP values at the time of the initial blood culture (11.0 mg/dL [IQR, 5.0–21.0 mg/dL] vs 14.0 mg/dL [IQR, 7.2–25.0 mg/dL]) (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10). Oral β-lactams were prescribed to most of the cohort (577 [63.1%]), oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed to 152 (16.6%), and less than 1% (4) received sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.

### Using antibiotics wisely [^112DpcPo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will describe role of shorter antibiotic therapies, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and artificial intelligence in infectious diseases.

Recent Findings

There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia that can be treated with 7days of therapy, community acquired pneumonia with 3days and ventilator associated pneumonia with just 7days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis and bone and joint infections is safe and effective and reduces line complications and costs. Also, for clean surgical procedures only one dose of antibiotic is needed, but it should be the most effective antibiotic which is cefazolin. This means avoiding clindamycin, removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence to incorporate into using antibiotics wisely is rapidly emerging but is still in early stages.

Summary

In using antibiotics wisely, targeting such as durations of therapy and conversion from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low hanging fruit. The future of artificial intelligence could automate a lot of this work and is exciting but needs to be proven.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Transition to oral antibiotic therapy for hospitalized adults with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections [^115BUiYw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The proportion of patients transitioned from IV to oral therapy by day 7 for GN-BSI was highly variable among the 24 hospitals. The lowest rate of oral transition was 25.8% (66 of 256), the highest was 65.9% (27 of 41), and most were between 30% and 50% (Figure 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The most common source of infection among patients administered oral therapy was the urinary tract, with Escherichia coli as the most common organism (60.4% [1189 of 1969]). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) comprised 64.9% (1277 of 1969) of all infections among the oral therapy group, followed by hepatobiliary (12.1% [239 of 1969]) and intra-abdominal (9.9% [194 of 1969]) infections (Figure 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Among patients maintained on IV therapy, UTIs were similarly the most common infection (38.6% [1008 of 2612]), followed by intra-abdominal (16.4% [429 of 2612]), hepatobiliary (11.1% [289 of 2612]), and central venous catheter (9.3% [242 of 2612]) infections. Of patients transitioned to oral therapy by day 7, commonly isolated organisms were E coli (60.4% [1189 of 1969]), Klebsiella species (18.8% [371 of 1969]), Pseudomonas species (5.8% [115 of 1969]), Enterobacter species (4.1% [80 of 1969]), Proteus species (3.9% [76 of 1969]), and Serratia species (2.0% [39 of 1969]) (Table 1). There were more extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing bacterial infections in the IV therapy group compared with the oral therapy group (10.6% [277 of 2612] vs 2.6% [51 of 1969]; P < .001). Several other organisms were more prevalent in the IV group than the oral therapy group, including Enterobacter species (6.4% [167 of 2612] vs 4.1% [80 of 1969]; P < .001), Morganella morganii (1.3% [35 of 2612] vs 0.3% [6 of 1969]; P < .001), Proteus species (6.1% [160 of 2612] vs 3.9% [76 of 1969]; p = 0.001), Pseudomonas species (10.9% [286 of 2612] vs 5.8% [115 of 1969]; P < .001), and Serratia species (3.9% [103 of 2612] vs 2.0% [39 of 1969]; P < .001). Total median duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter for the oral transition group than the IV group (11 days [IQR, 9–14 days] vs 13 days [IQR, 8–16]; P < .001).

### A phase 3, randomized, investigator-blinded trial comparing ceftobiprole with a standard-of-care cephalosporin, with or without vancomycin, for the treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients [^111xB6Cs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

For patients receiving a comparator antibiotic, vancomycin (10–15 mg/kg as an IV infusion every 6 hours) was also administered when MRSA was confirmed or suspected. Dose adjustments of vancomycin were performed to maintain steady-state trough blood levels at between 15 and 20 mg/L. Vancomycin doses were modified for patients with renal impairment. Concomitant treatment with amikacin, gentamicin or tobramycin for confirmed or suspected infection caused by P. aeruginosa could be added at the discretion of the blinded investigator.

After a minimum of 3 days' treatment with IV antibiotics, patients who met the standardized criteria for clinical improvement (see Text, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) could be switched to an oral antibiotic, at the discretion of the blinded investigator, to complete a minimum of 7 days' treatment. A macrolide was permitted for this oral switch. If required, prolongation of IV or oral antibiotic treatment was allowed for up to a total of 14 days. Patients who required concomitant treatment with a macrolide during the study (other than the switch outlined above) and those with no adequate response to IV study treatment within the first 3 days were withdrawn from the study and treated with an appropriate nonstudy, SoC antibiotic regimen.

The treatment period was followed by an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit within 24 hours after the last treatment, a test-of-cure (TOC) visit 7–14 days after the EOT assessment and a last follow-up (LFU) visit 28–35 days after the EOT assessment for all patients. Patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason were to remain in the study as part of the safety follow-up.

Ethics

The study was conducted in compliance with relevant local laws/regulations, International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the amended Declaration of Helsinki. An Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board at each site approved the study protocol and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board monitored the safety data to ensure patient safety. Each child's parent or legal guardian provided written informed consent. If appropriate, the child's assent was also sought before participation in the trial.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^114spAJK]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Instrumented lumbar spinal fusion — randomized trial comparing preoperative-only versus extended postoperative antibiotic protocols shows no significant difference in early infection, with defined dosing schedules. Two hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized into either a preoperative only protocol or preoperative with extended postoperative antibiotic protocol; patients in the preoperative-only group received a single dose of intravenous cefazolin 1 g or 2 g based on weight 30 minutes before incision, and the extended protocol added postoperative intravenous cefazolin every eight hours for three days followed by oral cephalexin every six hours for seven days. Thirty-six patients were eliminated, so 233 completed the study (117 preoperative only; 116 pre- and postoperative), and at 21 days there was no significant difference in infection rates; postoperative infection rates were 4.3% versus 1.7%, with an overall postoperative infection rate of 3%.

### Intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections: a double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^113nJwCo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to determine if cephalexin 500mg orally four times daily was non-inferior to cefazolin 2g intravenously daily plus probenecid 1g orally daily in the management of patients with uncomplicated mild-moderate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) presenting to the ED.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicentre, double dummy-blind, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial conducted at two tertiary care teaching hospitals in Canada. Patients were enrolled if they presented to the ED with an uncomplicated SSTI, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to oral cephalexin or intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid for up to 7 days. The primary outcome was failure of therapy at 72hours. Clinical cure at 7 days, intravenous to oral medication transition admission to hospital and adverse events were also evaluated.

Results

206 patients were randomised with 104 patients in the cephalexin group and 102 in the cefazolin and probenecid group. The proportion of patients failing therapy at 72hours was similar between the treatment groups (4.2% and 6.1%, risk difference 1.9%, 95%CI -3.7% to 7.6%). Clinical cure at 7days was not significantly different (100% and 97.7%, risk difference -2.3%, 95%CI -6.7% to 0.8%).

Conclusion

Cephalexin at appropriate doses appears to be a safe and effective alternative to outpatient parenteral cefazolin in the treatment of uncomplicated mild-moderate SSTIs who present to the ED.

### Prophylactic cefazolin dosing in obesity-a systematic review [^112kGAzB]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus on whether a standard 2-g prophylactic cefazolin dose provides sufficient antimicrobial coverage in obese surgical patients. This systematic review analysed both outcome and pharmacokinetic studies, aiming to determine the appropriate cefazolin dose. A systematic search was conducted using 4 databases. In total, 3 outcome and 15 pharmacokinetic studies met the inclusion criteria. All 3 outcome studies concluded that there is no need for increased dose. Also, 9 pharmacokinetic studies reached this conclusion; however, 6 pharmacokinetic studies recommended that 2-g dose is insufficient to achieve adequate plasma or tissue concentrations. The stronger body of evidence supports that 2-g dose of cefazolin is sufficient for surgery lasting up to 4 h; however, large-scale outcome studies are needed to confirm this evidence.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^116ZfDcB]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Oral antimicrobial agents in intra-abdominal infection — switching from intravenous therapy: An accepted principle of antimicrobial stewardship is the conversion from IV to oral anti-infective agents when the patient's condition permits, and although oral agents are often not feasible immediately after source control because of gastrointestinal intolerance, it is often possible to switch later once gastrointestinal function returns. A number of randomized controlled trials have permitted use of oral antibiotics as a substitute for IV antibiotics, though only a few directly tested equivalence; in one older randomized study, oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was permitted as continuation therapy and outcomes were similar to exclusive IV therapy.

The decision to use intravenous or oral agents has been debated. Currently, oral therapy is recommended for mild infections and intravenous therapy for severe infections. Moderate infections may be treated via the oral route, or with one to two intravenous doses and then transitioning to oral therapy. For patients with severe infections who are able to tolerate oral therapy and in whom clinical improvement has been documented, the goal should be to transition to the oral route as soon as possible. There is evidence to suggest that this approach positively impacts length of stay as well.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^1148B4PD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial management in AHO when microbial etiology is identified notes that for MSSA isolates, first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) or ASP (eg, oxacillin and nafcillin) are the preferred parenteral agents, and excellent outcomes with the transition to oral therapy with high-dose cephalexin or clindamycin are well documented; for MSSA infections, the safety and tolerability benefits of beta-lactam therapy are likely to be greater than glycopeptides (vancomycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and oxazolidinones (linezolid), but no controlled data comparing efficacy, tolerability, and adverse event profiles between agents have been collected specifically in children with AHO. For CA-MRSA isolates that are susceptible, clindamycin is the preferred agent, with tolerability and safety benefits greater than vancomycin, the ability to convert readily from parenteral to oral therapy due to good enteral bioavailability, and potential adherence improved by adding flavoring to the liquid formulation. Vancomycin remains the preferred initial antimicrobial agent for clindamycin-resistant CA-MRSA infections, and other MRSA-active agents may be considered as alternatives (eg, ceftaroline, daptomycin, linezolid, and TMP-SMX) but have been used less often than vancomycin for the treatment of AHO; few published data exist for treatment outcomes, safety, tolerability, or standardized dosing of antimicrobial agents.

### Cefazolin [^114nDKcZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

*In rare instances, doses of up to 12 grams of Cefazolin for Injection, USP per day have been used.

Perioperative Prophylactic Use: To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, recommended doses are:

a. 1 gram IV or IM administered1/2hour to 1 hour prior to the start of surgery.

b. For lengthy operative procedures (e.g., 2 hours or more), 500 mg to 1 gram IV or IM during surgery (administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure).

c. 500 mg to 1 gram IV or IM every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively.

It is important that (1) the preoperative dose be given just (1/2to 1 hour) prior to the start of surgery so that adequate antibiotic levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (2) Cefazolin for Injection, USP be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient levels of the antibiotic at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms.

In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection, USP may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113JtVHT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

A randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, investigator-initiated trial was conducted to determine whether oral fosfomycin is noninferior to oral ciprofloxacin for achieving clinical cure in the step-down treatment of E. coli fUTIs in women. The protocol was published. The University Medical Center Utrecht Institutional Review Board provided ethical approval. The study was performed in 15 Dutch hospitals: 4 academic centers and 11 large teaching hospitals. All respective institutional review boards approved the study. The manuscript was written according to the CONSORT checklist.

Participants

Eligible patients were competent women aged ≥ 18 years, hospitalized with a diagnosis of fUTI, with at least 1 urinary tract symptom and systemic symptoms or signs. Urine (≥ 10 4 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) and/or blood cultures had to reveal E. coli susceptible to both ciprofloxacin (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≤ 0.25mg/L) and fosfomycin (MIC ≤ 32mg/L) according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility (EUCAST) criteria, as measured with automated panel tests (PHOENIX or VITEK), disc diffusion, or Etest. If blood and urine cultures both revealed E. coli, local symptoms were not required. Patients should have received appropriate empirical IV antibiotics for 2–5 days, consisting of second- or third-generation cephalosporin, amoxicillin ± clavulanic acid, an aminoglycoside, carbapenem, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, or a combination of these with in vitro susceptibility of the causative E. coli, according to EUCAST criteria, to at least 1 of the agents used. Patients were judged to be eligible for an IV–oral switch on clinical judgment, according to the Dutch guideline that recommends switching therapy after 48–72 hours of intravenous antibiotic therapy. A patient was excluded if urine culture (≥ 10 3 CFU/mL) or blood culture yielded non– E. coli pathogens. Patients with urinary catheters, placed ≥ 24 hours before admission, were excluded. Other eligibility criteria are listed in the protocol (Supplementary Material, Protocol S1).

Randomization and Masking

Because empirical antimicrobial treatment for fUTIs differed between hospitals, randomization was performed with stratification per hospital so that each hospital contained a blinded allocation list. Patients, physicians, local dispensing pharmacists, and investigators were blinded for treatment allocation.

### A randomized controlled double blind trial comparing the effects of the prophylactic antibiotic, cefazolin, administered at caesarean delivery at two different timings (before skin incision and after cord clamping) on both the mother and newborn [^111Ni511]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Mothers with known allergy to Cephalosporin or Penicillin, those who received antibiotics within a week prior to CD, those with altered liver or renal functions and those on antiepileptic medication were excluded from the study. Babies with known major congenital anomalies were not included as well. Women undergoing CD were randomized to receive both single dose of IV Cefazolin 1 g and placebo. As per the randomization, every mother was given IV Cefazolin1gm either 30 min to 1 h, prior to skin incision, with placebo administered within a minute after cord clamping or placebo administered 30 min to 1 h prior to skin incision and Cefazolin 1 g IV, within a minute after cord clamping. The randomization covers with the blinded drugs were opened in the Operation Theatre (OT). The medications were administered by the Anaesthetist appropriately as per the randomisation. Cord blood was collected in every 8th neonate to estimate the amount of antibiotic levels in the neonate. The cord blood (5 ml) was collected soon after delivery of the baby in a blood collecting test tube, centrifuged and the serum was refrigerated for analysis. The drug level (Cefazolin) was analysed by a developed and validated High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with Ultra violet protection method in the clinical pharmacological unit. Thus, the investigator, the patient and the Labour Room personnel were blinded to the drug used. After CD, all the outcomes listed below were assessed until discharge from hospital and at the first postpartum visit at 6 weeks and noted. In addition, basic demographic and obstetric data were noted as well. The primary maternal outcomes assessed were the presence of SSI, endometritis, UTI and length of hospital stay. The primary outcomes assessed for the neonate were incidence of early and late onset sepsis, oral thrush, increased frequency of stools, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes in the mother and the neonate that were followed up were the number of readmissions and maternal / neonatal death due to sepsis until 6 weeks postpartum.
