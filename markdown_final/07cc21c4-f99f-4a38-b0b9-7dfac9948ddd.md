## Question

What are the current guidelines for anticoagulation in TAVR patients with atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current guidelines and evidence for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, including how to choose between DOACs and VKAs, whether to add antiplatelet therapy, and how to handle the early post-TAVR period and special scenarios like subclinical leaflet thrombosis and periprocedural management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prevalence of AF in TAVR. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend and where they are silent. Next, I will review randomized trials and large observational datasets to compare DOACs versus VKAs. After that, I need to examine the role of concomitant antiplatelet therapy and the early post-TAVR window. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight uncertainties and ongoing trials that could change practice soon.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this is hard. AF is common in TAVR cohorts, roughly 30–50% at baseline, and new-onset AF occurs in a meaningful minority, which immediately creates competing thrombotic and bleeding risks in an older, multimorbid population, so any antithrombotic plan must be individualized and dynamic over time [^115BXZXQ] [^114L8C3e] [^113MLDRN].

> Next, I should review what guidelines actually say. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do any guidelines explicitly prefer DOACs over VKAs after TAVR for AF? The 2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guideline states that for patients with AF and a bioprosthetic valve beyond 3 months, NOACs are an effective alternative to VKAs based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc, but it does not specify a preference after TAVR per se, reflecting limited direct evidence at the time [^115DCmNA]. The 2024 ESC AF guideline emphasizes individualized reassessment of thromboembolic risk and initiation of OAC when indicated, again without TAVR-specific agent preference, reinforcing that decisions should be individualized and periodically revisited [^1137EyoX] [^1126ntor]. Earlier European guidance suggested NOACs could be considered after the third month post-TAVR, but this was low-level and not a strong directive, underscoring the evidence gap [^112GrjLH].

> I will now examine randomized evidence comparing DOACs and VKAs in TAVR patients with AF. Wait, let me verify the pivotal trials. ENVISAGE-TAVI AF randomized edoxaban versus VKA after TAVR in patients with AF and showed noninferiority for net adverse clinical events but a higher risk of major bleeding, largely gastrointestinal, which tempers enthusiasm for edoxaban in this setting despite overall efficacy parity [^116Te9t3]. ATLANTIS, which included patients with and without an OAC indication, did not show superiority of apixaban over standard care for net clinical benefit, so it neither established superiority nor clearly favored VKA either, leaving equipoise for agent selection [^111yu44B]. These mixed RCT signals explain why guidelines have not endorsed a universal DOAC-first approach after TAVR for AF [^116Te9t3] [^111yu44B].

> Next, I should review large real-world datasets to see if observational signals align. Multiple analyses from the STS/ACC TVT Registry show that DOAC use has risen dramatically and is associated with similar stroke risk but lower bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality compared with VKA at one year, even after adjustment, though residual confounding remains possible [^113L4gFX] [^113Ctpdy]. Japanese nationwide claims data similarly suggest lower thromboembolic and bleeding events with DOACs versus VKA over longer follow-up, supporting a safety advantage signal for DOACs in routine practice, albeit nonrandomized [^112ac5CA] [^112nRAxc]. Hold on, I should double-check for conflicting observational signals — some earlier observational work raised concern about worse composite outcomes with certain DOACs, but these findings have not been consistently reproduced in larger, more recent cohorts, reinforcing the need to interpret single-center or small studies cautiously [^116mNUiS] [^113L4gFX].

> Let me consider meta-analyses to synthesize across designs. Several meta-analyses pooling RCTs and observational studies report broadly similar stroke and mortality outcomes between DOACs and VKAs, with some analyses suggesting lower all-cause mortality with DOACs at longer follow-up, although heterogeneity and confounding limit certainty and preclude definitive superiority claims [^1157FzNi] [^1126PcQn] [^116Smuw7]. I should confirm that these analyses also flag bleeding trade-offs and agent-specific differences, which they do, reinforcing that agent choice may need to be individualized rather than categorical [^1157FzNi] [^116Smuw7].

> Now, I need to check the role of concomitant antiplatelet therapy, because that is where harm often accrues. Multiple observational analyses and randomized data in TAVR populations with AF show that adding antiplatelet therapy to therapeutic OAC increases bleeding without reducing ischemic events, aligning with the broader AF-PCI literature and leading to a "less is more" approach when AF is the sole indication for anticoagulation after TAVR [^116qWf5G] [^111abh8c] [^111LRdNz]. Wait, I should verify whether any guideline endorses routine addition of antiplatelet therapy in this scenario — contemporary guidance and consensus documents discourage routine APT add-on unless there is a separate compelling indication such as recent ACS or complex coronary stenting, which is consistent with the observed harm signal [^111LRdNz] [^11358nXh].

> I should confirm how to handle the early post-TAVR period, especially the first 3 months. Guidelines suggest that within 3 months of bioprosthetic valve implantation, VKA may be reasonable in some patients, particularly if there are concerns for subclinical leaflet thrombosis or high thrombotic risk, but this is weak recommendation territory and not universally required for TAVR patients with AF who are otherwise stable on OAC [^115DCmNA] [^117B8asd]. Subclinical leaflet motion abnormalities are variably prevalent on CT and may regress with anticoagulation, but their clinical significance and whether routine OAC beyond AF indications improves outcomes remain uncertain, so routine intensification solely for subclinical thrombosis is not supported outside trials [^117B8asd] [^112GrjLH]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: if a patient with AF on OAC has early high gradients or suspected leaflet thrombosis, a short course of intensified anticoagulation may be reasonable, but this should be individualized and imaging-guided rather than automatic [^117B8asd].

> Next, I should review periprocedural and interruption strategies. For elective procedures, interruption of OAC is commonly managed without bridging when bleeding risk is high and thrombotic risk is modest, with resumption as soon as hemostasis allows; bridging is reserved for selected high thrombotic risk scenarios, and this principle applies to TAVR patients with AF as well, with decisions anchored to CHA₂DS₂-VASc and procedural bleeding risk rather than the mere presence of a bioprosthetic valve [^116ncxRY] [^112kdLNm]. I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing from surgical valve guidance — yes, the same cautious, individualized approach holds for TAVR bioprostheses without mechanical components [^116ncxRY].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while acknowledging uncertainty. For most TAVR patients with AF beyond 3 months, a DOAC is a reasonable default given ease of use, fewer interactions, no INR monitoring, and consistent signals for less bleeding and similar or possibly lower mortality in observational cohorts, provided there are no contraindications such as mechanical valves or rheumatic mitral stenosis and renal function is adequate for dosing [^115DCmNA] [^113L4gFX]. VKA remains appropriate when there is severe renal impairment, drug–drug interactions, patient preference, or when there is a need for precise INR targets in special circumstances, recognizing that maintaining therapeutic INR can be challenging in frail, multimorbid patients and may drive worse outcomes in some settings [^113NEQ5v] [^112nRAxc]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline framing — yes, both ACC/AHA and ESC emphasize individualized selection and periodic reassessment rather than a one-size-fits-all agent mandate [^115DCmNA] [^1137EyoX].

> But wait, what if the patient is within 3 months of TAVR or has suspected leaflet thrombosis? In that early window, if the patient is already on OAC for AF, continuing OAC alone is generally sufficient; adding routine antiplatelet therapy is not beneficial and increases bleeding, and short-term VKA intensification can be considered selectively for suspected subclinical thrombosis with close imaging follow-up, but this is not standard for all [^116qWf5G] [^117B8asd]. I should confirm that ongoing trials may refine this early-period strategy — indeed, programs like CREATE are exploring whether antiplatelet therapy can be stopped even in patients without OAC indications at one year, underscoring the broader "less is more" momentum after TAVR [^112Aqkqh].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is dynamic. AF risk evolves, bleeding risk changes with age and comorbidities, and renal function shifts, so I should schedule periodic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks, review medications for interactions, and adjust the antithrombotic regimen accordingly, consistent with ESC guidance for iterative risk evaluation in AF [^1137EyoX]. Shared decision-making is essential, especially when the evidence is observational and agent-specific bleeding profiles differ, so I will document the rationale for DOAC versus VKA and revisit the choice at least annually or when clinical status changes [^115DCmNA].

For TAVR patients with AF, **lifelong oral anticoagulation is recommended** [^115DCmNA] to prevent thromboembolism, with DOACs preferred over VKAs when there is no mechanical valve or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^113NEQ5v]. VKAs are reserved for mechanical valves or rheumatic mitral stenosis [^115DCmNA]. Routine antiplatelet therapy is not recommended unless there is a separate coronary indication, as it increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^116qWf5G] [^111JzMDw]. Anticoagulation choice should be individualized based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED, with regular monitoring and dose adjustments for renal function and interactions [^113NEQ5v] [^115jguaK].

## Indications for anticoagulation in TAVR patients with AF

Anticoagulation is indicated to prevent thromboembolism in TAVR patients with AF; **lifelong oral anticoagulation is recommended** for patients with clinical AF at elevated thromboembolic risk [^115TXiV9] [^1132QdAy].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant therapy

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

- **Preference**: DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are preferred over VKAs for AF patients without mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^113NEQ5v] [^114UcV6o].

- **Evidence**: DOACs are noninferior to VKAs for stroke prevention with lower major bleeding risk in AF [^116mNUiS].

- **TAVR-specific data**: Observational and randomized data suggest DOACs have comparable stroke rates and lower bleeding than VKAs post-TAVR [^113L4gFX] [^113Ctpdy] [^112ac5CA].

---

### Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)

- **Indication**: VKAs (warfarin) are indicated for AF patients with mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^11482Gr3] [^115DCmNA].

- **Monitoring**: VKAs require INR monitoring and dose adjustments, which can be challenging in elderly TAVR patients [^112nRAxc] [^113NEQ5v].

- **Risks**: VKAs have higher bleeding risk and interactions compared to DOACs [^113Ctpdy] [^112MDd1s].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy considerations

Routine antiplatelet therapy is not recommended for TAVR patients with AF without a separate coronary indication, as it increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^116qWf5G] [^111JzMDw]. If antiplatelet therapy is indicated for coronary disease, use the lowest effective dose and duration with close monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation should be continued **lifelong** for TAVR patients with AF unless contraindications arise [^112MDd1s].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should monitor for bleeding, thromboembolism, and adherence, with **annual reassessment** of thromboembolic and bleeding risk using CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED [^notfound]. Renal function should be checked regularly to guide DOAC dosing and adjustments [^113NEQ5v].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical valves**: VKAs are required; DOACs are contraindicated [^115DCmNA].

- **Moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis**: VKAs are indicated; DOACs are not recommended [^1176E2p1] [^115DCmNA].

- **High bleeding risk**: Use caution, consider lower DOAC doses, and monitor closely [^115jguaK].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended anticoagulant** | **Antiplatelet therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| AF without mechanical valve or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis | DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) | Not recommended unless coronary indication |
| AF with mechanical valve or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis | VKA (warfarin) | Not recommended unless coronary indication |
| High bleeding risk | DOACs with caution, lower doses | Not recommended unless coronary indication |

---

Anticoagulation in TAVR patients with AF should be **individualized**, with DOACs preferred when appropriate and VKAs reserved for mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis; routine antiplatelet therapy is not recommended without a coronary indication.

Clinical Perspective

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a therapeutic intervention for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Compared with surgical aortic valve replacement, TAVR has demonstrated noninferiority, particularly in high‐risk or inoperable patients.

Recently, the indications for TAVR have expanded to include low‐risk cases. As the procedure became more widely available, the choice of antithrombotic therapy also diverged. Despite these advances, the incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events after TAVR remains a major concern, underscoring the ongoing debate regarding the optimal antithrombotic therapy selection and combination.

Current guidelines, based on previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) results, recommend monotherapy for patients undergoing TAVR with an indication for anticoagulation. Although these trials have demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for thromboembolic events, the choice between DOACs and VKAs remains debated. In the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation) trial, edoxaban was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding events than VKA. Conversely, the ATLANTIS (Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke) trial, which compared apixaban with standard therapy, including VKA, found no difference in bleeding events.

The diverse backgrounds of patients undergoing TAVR may result in discrepancies between the results of RCTs and observational studies. A previous observational study demonstrated that a higher risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events occurred among older adults, and these studies showed that VKA may pose a higher risk than DOAC. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the association between the choice of anticoagulants post‐TAVR and thromboembolic and bleeding events using a nationwide database covering almost the entire population of Japan.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulant and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the STS / ACC TVT registry [^1126ntor]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in more than 40% of patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)and has been associated with an increased risk of both subacute and late stroke development. Over the last decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced and shown to be a better alternative in patients with nonvalvular AF. Given its benefits and convenience in use, DOACs are being used with increasing frequency among patients in need of oral anticoagulation (OAC) undergoing TAVR. Although the current clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients with AF include the use of DOACs for those with bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), no specific recommendations are available for patients undergoing TAVR. With the differences in structure and procedural factors of surgical and transcatheter BHV, it remains unclear whether the recommendations can be applied to patients with TAVR interchangeably and whether the effectiveness profiles of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and DOACs are similar in TAVR populations.

Using the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) STS/ACC TVT (Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry, we sought to evaluate (1) characteristics of patients with AF who were discharged on VKAs versus DOACs; (2) trends of VKA versus DOAC use for stroke prevention in patients with TAVR and AF; and (3) the 1‐year rate of stroke, bleeding, and mortality outcomes comparing between patients discharged with VKA versus DOACs.

### Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111JzMDw]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment option for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who are candidates for a bioprosthesis across the entire spectrum of risk. However, TAVR carries a risk for thrombotic and bleeding events, underscoring the importance of defining the optimal adjuvant antithrombotic regimen. Antithrombotic considerations are convoluted by the fact that many patients undergoing TAVR are generally elderly and present with multiple comorbidities, including conditions that may require long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) (eg, atrial fibrillation) and antiplatelet therapy (eg, coronary artery disease). After TAVR among patients without baseline indications for OAC, recent data suggest dual-antiplatelet therapy to be associated with an increased risk for bleeding events, particularly early postprocedure, compared with single-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Concerns surrounding the potential for thrombotic complications have raised the hypothesis of adjunctive use of OAC for patients with no baseline indications for anticoagulation. Although effective in modulating thrombus formation at the valve level, the bleeding hazard has shown to be unacceptably high, and the net benefit of combining antiplatelet and OAC therapy is unproven. For patients with indications for the use of long-term OAC, such as those with atrial fibrillation, the adjunctive use of antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding. Whether direct oral anticoagulant agents achieve better outcomes than vitamin K antagonists remains under investigation. Overall, single-antiplatelet therapy and OAC appear to be reasonable strategies in patients without and with indications for concurrent anticoagulation. The aim of the present review is to appraise the current published research and recommendations surrounding the management of antithrombotic therapy after TAVR, with perspectives on evolving paradigms and ongoing trials.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113MLDRN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) antithrombotic therapy — new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) after TAVR and pharmacotherapy guidance are as follows: the incidence of new-onset AF after TAVR ranges from < 1% to 8.6%. In the absence of clinical trials evaluating alternate antithrombotic regimens after TAVR, there is no consensus on the optimal agent(s) or duration of therapy, and there are no randomized studies of different antithrombotic regimens after TAVR. The current standard antithrombotic therapy after TAVR is clopidogrel 75 mg orally daily for 3 to 6 months with oral aspirin 75 mg to 100 mg daily lifelong. Patients with chronic AF or other indications for long-term anticoagulation should receive anticoagulation as per guidelines for AF in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Vitamin K antagonist therapy may be considered in the first 3 months after TAVR in patients who are at risk of AF or valve thrombosis; when vitamin K antagonist therapy is used, continuation of aspirin is reasonable, and it may be prudent to avoid other antiplatelet therapy given the increased risk of bleeding with multiple simultaneous antithrombotic agents. For surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, data support a Class IIb indication for 3 months of vitamin K antagonist therapy after valve implantation, but whether these data apply to TAVR is unknown.

### Novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in transcatheter aortic valve replacement treated patients-patients' vulnerability still matters [^114UcV6o]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are affected by atrial fibrillation (AF) in 16%–59% of cases at different periprocedural stages, thus requiring oral anticoagulation. Current 2020 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AF, recommend novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in NOAC‐eligible patients (class I, LoE A). It should be noted that most AF NOAC trials demonstrating the superiority of NOACs over VKAs, enrolled only small numbers of AS patients, limiting the generalizability of these results in that particular setting. Accordingly, the current ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease published later in 2021 do not specify the type of oral anticoagulant (OAC) but just the use of it lifelong for TAVR patients who have other indications for OAC (class I, LoE B). Thus, the question whether or not the NAOC has to be preferred still lingers.

In this issue of Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions, Memon M. M. et al. performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis, not patient level, to assess the risks and benefits of these drug classes in TAVR patients affected by AF. A total of 12 studies were included (three randomized controlloed trials (RCTs) and nine observational), evaluating 12,203 patients of which 5544 had NOAC and 6660 had VKA (mean age range 71.2–84.4 years, average 81.2 years). The authors found no significant difference between NOACs and VKAs in terms of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, all‐cause mortality, and myocardial infarction at a mean length of follow‐up of 15.1 months, without any significant difference also in the subgroup analysis by study design (RCT or observational). Meta‐regression analysis found heterogeneity in all‐cause mortality to be significantly explained by percentage of males, mean age, and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. The authors conclude that, according to their analysis, outcomes with NOACs do not significantly differ compared to VKAs following TAVR in patients with AF.

### Anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: national database insights [^112nRAxc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study examined the choice of anticoagulants in patients with AF who underwent TAVR using comprehensive claims data. Patients prescribed VKA had a higher incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events over a 3‐year follow‐up period than those prescribed a DOAC. These results were consistent with all composite outcomes and suggest that VKA may be at a higher risk in this population.

In our observational cohort, DOAC prescriptions increased steadily following TAVR. This trend reflects a broad shift in AF management, favoring DOACs over VKAs because of their improved safety profile and ease of use. While current TAVR guidelines recommend OAC therapy for patients indicated for anticoagulation, the evidence for anticoagulant selection remains controversial. Despite the differences in our study population, including a higher proportion of older patients compared with previous studies, our findings are consistent with other observational studies that reported more frequent use of DOAC than VKA. This change highlights the shift in practice patterns in anticoagulation and emphasizes the need for more definitive evidence to support anticoagulant selection in this population.

According to this study, thromboembolism and bleeding events occurred more frequently in the VKA group than in the DOAC group. Adjustments for background factors and sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. These results align with the challenges in managing VKA therapy in a real‐world setting for patients with multiple comorbidities. Effective VKA management requires careful and consistent monitoring of the international normalized ratio, which is often difficult to achieve in such patients. Factors such as diet, drug interactions, and patient compliance complicate the maintenance of therapeutic international normalized ratio levels and increase the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding. Previous studies have reported a higher bleeding risk with VKA therapy than with DOAC therapy in populations with multiple comorbidities and frailty. Compared with previous RCTs, this study included more female and older patients. These differences in patient characteristics may have led to fewer thromboembolic and bleeding events in the DOAC group compared with VKA in our study. The delayed divergence in the Kaplan–Meier curves in Figure 2 suggests that the differences between the DOAC and VKA groups may not be entirely attributable to the TAVR procedure itself. The results may be attributable to the challenge of achieving consistent long‐term international normalized ratio control in this population. This study was the largest study to be conducted in a population with AF who underwent TAVR, enabling the inclusion of patients who were underrepresented or excluded in previous RCTs.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yu44B]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior and new atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with severe AS receiving TAVR, and AF is associated with increased mortality and adverse ischemic and bleeding events. Warfarin is the main anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, but it has disadvantages such as narrow treatment window, variable dose–response, interaction with drugs and food, and the need for international normalized ratio (INR) detection. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that DOAC is as good or better than warfarin for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. The guidelines recommend DOACs as the first choice for anticoagulant therapy in patients with DOACs indications.DOACs are increasingly being used in place of warfarin, but the evidence for their effectiveness and safety in patients with valvular AF remains limited. The 2021 ESC/EACTS (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery) guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease recommend that patients with TAVR without anticoagulant indications receive single antiplatelet drug therapy for life after 3–6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence). In addition, lifetime anticoagulant therapy is recommended for patients with anticoagulant indications (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence). Due to the scarcity of data on patients after TAVR, no strong anticoagulation recommendations have been made so far. The ATLANTIS (Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke) trial failed to demonstrate the superiority of full‐dose apixaban over the current standard of treatment in patients with or without indications for oral anticoagulants, apixaban was not different from standard care for the primary endpoint of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, intracardiac or valvular thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, or major bleeding. The ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of edoxaban and VKAs in AF patients after TAVR. The results showed that edoxaban was not inferior to VKA in terms of combined adverse events, but increased the risk of major bleeding.

Compared with VKAs, the effect of DOACs on AF after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied, so we conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of VKAs and DOACs in patients with AF after TAVR.

CONCLUSIONS

This observational study suggests that DOACs may be preferable to VKAs because of their association with lower rates of thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with AF undergoing TAVR. These findings may provide useful information for clinicians when selecting appropriate anticoagulation therapies for this population. Further RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and provide robust evidence for clinical decision making.

Objectives

The study sought to examine the risk of ischemic events and bleeding episodes associated with differing antithrombotic strategies in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy (APT) post-TAVR to reduce the risk of stroke. However, data on the efficacy and safety of this recommendation in the setting of a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation (due to atrial fibrillation [AF]) with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) are scarce.

Methods

A multicenter evaluation comprising 621 patients with AF undergoing TAVR was undertaken. Post-TAVR prescriptions were used to determine the antithrombotic regimen used according to the following 2 groups: monotherapy (MT) with VKA (n = 101) or multiple antithrombotic therapy (MAT) with VKA plus 1 or 2 antiplatelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel; n = 520). Endpoint definitions were in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The rate of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death), major or life-threatening bleeding events, and death were assessed by a Cox multivariate model regression survival analysis according to the antithrombotic regime used.

Results

During a median follow-up of 13 months (interquartile range: 3 to 31 months) there were no differences between groups in the rate of stroke (MT: 5%, MAT: 5.2%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 3.48; p = 0.67), major adverse cardiovascular events (MT: 13.9%, MAT: 16.3%; adjusted HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.75 to 2.36; p = 0.33), and death (MT 22.8%, MAT: 19.2%; adjusted HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.50; p = 0.76). A higher risk of major or life-threatening bleeding was found in the MAT group (MT: 14.9%, MAT: 24.4%; adjusted HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.28; p = 0.04). These results remained similar when patients receiving VKA plus only 1 antiplatelet agent (n = 463) were evaluated.

Conclusions

In TAVR recipients prescribed VKA therapy for AF, concomitant antiplatelet therapy use appears not to reduce the incidence of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, or death, while increasing the risk of major or life-threatening bleeding.

### Management of atrial fibrillation post transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^116FAKQ3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Some of these patients have preexisting AF as well. The management of these patients is complex, especially after the procedure, when there is a sudden change in hemodynamics. There are no established guidelines about the management of the patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with preexisting or new-onset AF. This review article discusses the management of these patients with rate and rhythm control strategies with medications. This article also highlights the role of newer oral anticoagulation medications and left atrial occlusion devices to prevent stroke after the procedure. We will also discuss new advances in the care of this patient population to prevent the occurrence of AF after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. In conclusion, this article is a synopsis of both pharmacologic and device interventions for the management of AF in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

### Novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157FzNi]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared to the current guideline-recommended vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not been well established. We pooled evidence from all available studies to assess the risks and benefits of this drug class.

Methods

We queried electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane central) up until January 28th, 2022 for studies comparing NOACs to VKAs in AF patients undergoing TAVR. Results from studies were presented as risk ratios (RR) and pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis by study design and meta-regression analysis were performed to explore heterogeneity.

Results

A total of 12 studies (3 RCTs and 9 observational) containing 12,203 patients (mean age 81.2 years; 50.5% men) were identified and included in the analysis. Pooled analysis revealed no significant difference between NOACs and VKAs in terms of stroke or systemic embolism (RR: 0.78; p = 0.18), major bleeding (RR: 0.84; p = 0.32), intracranial hemorrhage (RR 0.61; p = 0.06), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.69; p = 0.07), and myocardial infarction (RR: 1.60; p = 0.24) at a mean length of follow-up of 15.1 months. RCTs and observational studies did not significantly differ across outcomes on subgroup analysis. Meta-regression analysis found heterogeneity in all-cause mortality to be significantly explained by percentage of males (coefficient: 0.049, p = 0.007), mean age (coefficient: 0.221, p < 0.001), and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (coefficient: -1.657, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that outcomes with NOACs do not significantly differ compared to VKAs following TAVR in patients with AF.

### Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114FpbXR]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

The performance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has expanded considerably during the past decade. Technological advances and refinement in implantation techniques have resulted in improved procedural outcomes, whereas indications are progressively extending toward lower-risk patients. Ischemic/embolic complications and major bleeding remain important and strongly correlate to mortality. In this regard, the optimal antithrombotic regimen after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains unclear, in the absence of randomized trials. For patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation, empirical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 3 to 6 months is currently recommended. However, dual antiplatelet therapy has been preliminarily associated with increased risk of bleeding compared with single antiplatelet therapy without significant ischemic benefit. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants and warfarin have also entered clinical investigation, to address the issue of preexisting or new-onset of atrial fibrillation and potentially attenuate subclinical leaflet thrombosis. Clinical trials are necessary to systematically address the risks and benefits of these approaches. In this review, we present the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications and provide updated insights on the rationale behind the various antithrombotic regimens being currently evaluated in large randomized trials.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation trials — ongoing randomized studies of antiplatelet and anticoagulant strategies are described. The Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (POPUlar TAVI, n = 1000) randomizes patients to aspirin alone versus aspirin plus clopidogrel for 3 months and evaluates freedom of non-procedure-related bleeding complications at 1 year follow-up; in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC), clopidogrel plus OAC is compared with OAC alone (NCT02247128). The Global Study Comparing a rivaRoxaban-based Antithrombotic Strategy to an antiplatelet-based Strategy after Transcatheter aortic valve rEplacement to Optimize Clinical Outcome (Galileo, n = 1520) assigns patients in the OAC arm to receive 10 mg of rivaroxaban up to 25 months plus low-dose aspirin during the first 3 months versus dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel (for 3 months) followed by aspirin alone, assessing reduction of death or first clinical thromboembolic events with no increase in bleeding complications (NCT02556230).

### Oral anticoagulation for atrial Fibrillation After TAVR: is vitamin K antagonist still the primary option? [^116mNUiS]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last years, several randomized studies have established transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as the primary treatment option in symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in 30% to 40%of those patients, and while it is associated with a higher risk of death and stroke during follow-up, the ideal oral anticoagulation (OAC) management remains to be defined.

POPULAR TAVI(Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) has shown that adding antiplatelet agents to patients requiring OAC, mainly for AF, is not associated with a reduction of the ischemic risk while increasing the risk of bleeding, and such association is no longer recommended.

In patients with AF from a nonvalvular cause, it has been shown that new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, are noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent the risk of stroke while being associated with a lower risk of major bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage.

While, based on these findings, it would be very attractive to recommend NOAC in patients with AF after TAVR, only a few hundred of patients included in those studies had a bioprosthetic heart valve. Furthermore, an observational report including 962 patients with AF undergoing TAVR suggested that the use of NOAC (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) as compared to VKA was associated with a 40% increase in the composite risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or any cerebrovascular event. Therefore, the last American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease acknowledged the paucity of data to support the use of NOAC for AF within 3 months after implantation of a surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic heart valve.

### Novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in transcatheter aortic valve replacement treated patients-patients' vulnerability still matters [^111uKfVm]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Key points

Current meta‐analysis suggests that outcomes with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not significantly differ compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), in particular, NOACs failed to demonstrate a better safety profile than VKAs in this clinical setting.
Accordingly, the choice between NOACs and VKAs in AF patients after TAVR is left to clinical judgment.
Future large‐scale clinical trials are warranted to establish a clinically superior anticoagulant regime in this clinical setting, based on risk profile and need for concomitant antiplatelet therapy.

### Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement antithrombotic treatment in nonindicated patients: updated systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114WLywM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The study was also registered in the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) database.

Search strategy

We conducted a systematic literature search to find studies comparing various antithrombotic regimens in patients undergoing TAVR without a chronic indication for OAC. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until August 2024. Following the PICO framework, the search strategy focused on 3 components: the population (TAVR patients without an indication for OAC), the intervention (various antithrombotic regimens), and the outcome (major adverse cardiac events [MACE], stroke, mortality, bleeding, and vascular complications). To ensure comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies, medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords for population (eg, "TAVR"), interventions (eg, "SAPT", "DAPT", "OAC", "DOAC", "VKA"), and outcomes (eg, "total bleeding", "life-threatening bleeding", "major bleeding", "minor bleeding", "stroke", "myocardial infarction", and "cardiovascular mortality"), along with their equivalent keywords. The full search strategy and the queries used for each database can be found in Supplemental Table 1.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were included if they matched the following criteria:

- Adult patients who received TAVR without indications for chronic antithrombotic treatment (eg, atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, cardiovascular interventions).
- Studies with any antithrombotic treatment, including SAPT, DAPT, and OAC consisting of VKA or DOAC and including at least one of the following outcomes: MACE, stroke, all-cause mortality, life-threatening/major bleeding, or vascular complications were included. We included the most recent publication with long-term outcomes for studies with multiple reports. This strategy was selected to ensure the most recent and thorough data.
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score matched (PSM) cohort studies were considered for inclusion.

Studies including patients already receiving OAC for baseline atrial fibrillation or other indications and those comparing different P2Y12 inhibitor regimens in both case and control arms were excluded. This exclusion criterion was applied to ensure consistency and comparability of control interventions across all included trials. Cohorts without PSM, case reports, reviews, commentaries, and nonhuman studies were also excluded.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^112GrjLH]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Post-TAVR management

Patients who receive a surgical or transcatheter heart valve should have a transthoracic echocardiography before discharge. Echocardiography should be routinely performed within 30–90 days to establish baseline valve function, at 1 year after AVR and then annually thereafter. Important parameters to follow are (the temporal evolution of) the transvalvular gradient, the degree of PVR/central regurgitation and the overall left ventricular function.

Regarding antithrombotic treatment following TAVR, the new 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines state that dual antiplatelet therapy should be considered for 3–6 months after TAVR, followed by lifelong single therapy in patients who do not need oral anticoagulation for other reasons (class IIa, LoE C). Single antiplatelet therapy may be considered after TAVR in the case of bleeding risk (class IIb, LoE C). In patients with TAVR with atrial fibrillation, novel oral anticoagulants should be considered as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after the third month of valve implantation (class IIa, LoE C).

Recently, subclinical leaflet thrombosis has been reported to occur in bioprosthetic aortic valves, more commonly in transcatheter than in surgical valves. This subclinical thrombosis of bioprosthesis may be more frequent when assessed by cardiac CT and associated with a moderate increase in transprosthetic gradients but the clinical consequences are unknown. It has been speculated that this phenomenon has importance with regard to increased risk of thromboembolic (neurological) events and/or reduced valve durability. Anticoagulation, but not dual antiplatelet therapy, is effective in prevention or treatment of subclinical leaflet thrombosis. Anticoagulant using a VKA and/or unfractionated heparin is the first-line treatment of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis. Despite excellent outcomes after TAVR with the new-generation valves, prevention and treatment of subclinical leaflet thrombosis might offer a potential opportunity for further improvement in clinical outcomes. Two ongoing randomised controlled trials (GALILEO, ATLANTIS) are specifically investigating which antithrombotic strategy might be best following TAVR.

Finally, in case of bioprosthetic valve failure with severe restenosis or aortic regurgitation (eg, degenerative, post-endocarditis), transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation is an option in this higher risk patient population.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132QdAy]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study shows that anticoagulant therapy with DOACs lowers the risk of all‐cause death in patients with AF after TAVR compared with VKAs. There was no significant difference between DOACs and VKAs in cardiovascular death, stroke, and major and/or life‐threatening bleeding. Our results provide a new clinical idea for choosing DOACs for patients with AF after TAVR.

The selection of antithrombotic strategies after TAVR is one of the hotspots of current research. ESC/EACTS have jointly published the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the Management of Valvular Heart Disease, which recommends that patients without oral anticoagulant indications after TAVR should be given lifelong single‐drug antiplatelet therapy, and patients with oral anticoagulant indications should be given lifelong oral anticoagulant therapy.TAVR is mainly applied to elderly high‐risk patients, who are not only at high risk of thrombosis but also at high risk of bleeding. The incidence of thrombosis and bleeding events is closely related to the prognosis, and postoperative ischemic and hemorrhagic complications are very common. Many patients have AF before TAVR, which may be related to the cardiovascular pathophysiological conditions of elderly patients, such as atrial fibrosis and left atrial diameter enlargement. Meanwhile, new‐onset AF after TAVR is also common, which may be related to the operation itself. AF increases the risk of postoperative cardiogenic embolic events and increases the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, cerebrovascular events, and mortality. In addition, bleeding events are also important events that should be widely concerned, which increases the difficulty of clinical antithrombotic therapy. Some risk factors, such as old age, frailty, falls, kidney disease, liver disease, malignant tumors, coagulation disorders, and antithrombotic therapy, may increase the risk of bleeding, which affects the patient's prognosis.

### Acute, periprocedural and longterm antithrombotic therapy in older adults: 2022 update by the ESC working group on thrombosis [^115jguaK]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The first international guidance on antithrombotic therapy in the elderly came from the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis in 2015. This same group has updated its previous report on antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs for older patients with acute or chronic coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, or undergoing surgery or procedures typical of the elderly (transcatheter aortic valve implantation and left atrial appendage closure). The aim is to provide a succinct but comprehensive tool for readers to understand the bases of antithrombotic therapy in older patients, despite the complexities of comorbidities, comedications and uncertain ischaemic- vs. bleeding-risk balance. Fourteen updated consensus statements integrate recent trial data and other evidence, with a focus on high bleeding risk. Guideline recommendations, when present, are highlighted, as well as gaps in evidence. Key consensus points include efforts to improve medical adherence through deprescribing and polypill use; adoption of universal risk definitions for bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke and cause-specific death; multiple bleeding-avoidance strategies, ranging from gastroprotection with aspirin use to selection of antithrombotic-drug composition, dosing and duration tailored to multiple variables (setting, history, overall risk, age, weight, renal function, comedications, procedures) that need special consideration when managing older adults.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) — antithrombotic management and trials are outlined as follows: Among TAVI patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but without coronary artery disease (CAD), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended in accordance with recommendations for AF alone, and TAVI patients taking OAC (e.g., for AF) and needing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be treated similarly to patients receiving a stent without TAVI. For those undergoing TAVI without concomitant need for OAC, patients should receive an antiplatelet regimen consisting of lifelong aspirin monotherapy or aspirin and clopidogrel for 3–6 months followed by aspirin monotherapy, and the use of prasugrel or ticagrelor in combination with aspirin or NOAC after TAVI has not been investigated and cannot be recommended at this time. Ongoing randomized studies include an anticoagulant-based strategy with apixaban 5 mg bid evaluated against standard-of-care with outcomes at 1 year follow-up, and a study comparing warfarin vs. edoxaban in a planned population of 1400 AF patients undergoing TAVI assessing overall side effects and major bleeding during 3 years follow-up.

### Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in post transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients with clinical indication for oral anticoagulation: a meta-analysis [^112MDd1s]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A majority of the population included in the study had AF as an indication of OAC therapy. It is well known that the AF increases the incidence of thrombosis, stroke, heart failure, and mortality, which could be reduced by appropriate antithrombotic therapy. The prevalence of pre‐existing and new‐onset AF in previous TAVR studies ranged from 15%–49% to 3%–23%, respectively. Comparing patients with pre‐existing AF and no AF, patients with new‐onset AF were related to a significantly higher risk of bleeding, stroke, and admissions from heart failure. Furthermore, a greater risk of ischemic or bleeding complications for TAVR patients with an indication of OAC could arise from the fact that most of these patients were elderly and have multiple comorbidities.

For patients with other indications for OAC in the post TAVR period, the application of OAC medication is recommended by the current guidelines and clinical practice; however, due to the lack of compelling evidence, there are significant inconsistencies of the OAC recommendations in this population among countries and institutions, ranging from OAC alone to triple antithrombotic therapy. It is similar to the antithrombotic regimen of each study we included, which was also different from each other. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society consensus statement recommends the NOAC therapy post‐TAVR, unless contraindicated in addition to aspirin for TAVR patients with AF. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines favor lifelong OAC for TAVR patients who have other indications for OAC, but failed to specify whether the NOAC or VKA was favored. In contrast, the updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline mentioned that VKAs may also be considered in post‐TAVR patients with another indication for OAC after assessment of bleeding risk. Further, well‐designed randomized controlled trials regarding the antithrombotic regimen for patients post‐TAVR who require OAC therapy are warranted.

In general, NOACs have a better safety profile than VKAs, which are less likely to be influenced by food or other medications, and do not require INR monitoring. This meta‐analysis demonstrates that NOAC therapy has similar efficiency and safety compared with VKA in patients post‐TAVR, requiring OAC therapy; thus, it is an attractive alternative than VKAs, which provides important insights and evidence on OAC strategy for many patients in this setting that may inform decisions in clinical practice. Therefore, more trials are needed to conduct and study anticoagulation therapy for these specific patient populations before recommendations from guidelines can be made.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulant and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the STS / ACC TVT registry [^114fPNM3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The current US guidelines for managing valvular diseases do not specifically address the use of VKA versus DOAC for patients with TAVR with an indication for OAC. Some clinicians apply the recommendations for the use of DOAC in patients with surgical BHV to patients with TAVR. However, the structure and hemodynamic impact of surgical and transcatheter BHV are different. The metal stent, a frame offering mechanical support for the oversewn xenograft tissue, is covered by fabric in surgical BHVs but is left exposed in TAVR devices. The different locations of where the valves are implanted may also have implications for their thrombogenicity because the endothelization of the protruding struts in the ascending aorta lumen is less than the part with direct endocardial contact. Also, there is a region of relative fluid stagnation between the Valsalva sinus and the native valve leaflets in TAVR. These factors may result in possibly different thrombogenic and endothelization profiles between TAVR devices and surgical BHV. Until more definitive data are available, OAC recommendations for patients with surgical BHV should be applied to patients with TAVR with caution.

Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy

OACs were prescribed based on prescription information and national guidelines.VKA doses were adjusted to maintain a prothrombin time–international normalized ratio of 1.6 to 2.5 or 2.0 to 3.0 according to periodic guidelines. Patients taking DOACs were mostly selected based on their creatinine clearance levels, whether nominal‐ or half‐dose DOACs were prescribed. In some patients, dual antiplatelet therapy was prescribed for 3 to 6 months. Continuation of single antiplatelet therapy was recommended; however, owing to the high risk of bleeding, antiplatelet therapy was discontinued at the clinician's discretion. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies after TAVR were administered at the discretion of the heart team at each institution, considering the risk of bleeding, stroke, and thrombosis.

Conclusions

In an analysis from a large clinical data registry of US patients with AF undergoing TAVR, we found that the 1‐year risk of stroke was similar between VKAs and DOACs whereas DOACs use was associated with a reduction in risks of bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all‐cause mortality when compared with VKA. Because of the limitations of observational study, further randomized controlled trials and long‐term studies are warranted to evaluate whether DOACs should be recommended over VKA in patients with TAVR requiring anticoagulation for AF.

Discussion

This is the largest observational study comparing outcomes between the use of DOACs and VKA for oral anticoagulation in patients with TAVR and preexisting or incident AF. Between 2013 and 2018, approximately 60% of patients were discharged with VKA whereas 40% of patients were discharged with DOACs. The use of DOACs increased 5.5‐fold from 2013 to 2018. When compared with VKA, DOAC was associated with comparable stroke outcomes and significantly lower bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality risks at 1 year, even after multivariate adjustment.

DOACs have been approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF since 2010 and the adoption of DOACs for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism by cardiologists has been rapid. Similarly, this study demonstrated the rapid adoption in patients with TAVR, 5.5‐fold in 5 years, despite inconclusive guideline recommendations. Despite the rapid adoption, DOACs appear to be used only in a selected population. The patients in the DOAC group had lower prevalence of known bleeding risk factors, lower nonfemoral approach, were less likely to have triple therapy and were less sick when compared with the warfarin group. Direct aortic access and transapical access are known to be associated with increased mortality and adverse events. We hypothesized that limited access to antidote, limited evidence of using DOAC in patients with dialysis/advanced chronic kidney disease, lack of studies for triple therapy uses, lack of guidelines/clinical trials support, and lower experience with DOACs during the study period could affect clinician decisions in prescribing DOACs in TAVR with AF and prescribed DOACs only in the patients with lower risks. Although these risk factors were statistically adjusted for the outcomes, this clinical selective could affect the results of this study.

### Stroke in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: embracing the unpredictable [^11523iXN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Strokes beyond the first few days of TAVR could be secondary to valve‐related (eg, valve thrombosis) or patient‐related causes (eg, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, etc.). Multiple studies have shown no significant role for anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing clinical stroke and potentially increasing the risk of bleeding, compared with aspirin alone after TAVR. Accordingly, the most recent American and European guidelines did not endorse the use of anticoagulants or dual antiplatelets after TAVR if not otherwise indicated (lifelong single antiplatelet is Class I in the European guidelines, and IIa in the American guidelines). Furthermore, a prior analysis demonstrated comparable rate of late stroke (beyond 2 years) in patients who underwent TAVR versus age‐ and sex‐matched populations. In the current analysis, history of cerebrovascular events was a predictor of post‐TAVR stroke beyond 24 hours, and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was significantly higher in patients who experienced 30‐day stroke after TAVR versus not. Strict risk factor control and ruling out other causes of stroke, such as atrial fibrillation, in those patients are of utmost importance.

Although "prevention is better than cure", stroke with TAVR remains unpredictable and largely unavoidable, and identifying effective management strategies in those patients may be our best bet until better risk‐prediction models and prevention strategies are available. Although there is a lack of consensus about the optimal management of these patients, the current advancement in the field of endovascular interventions to treat acute ischemic strokepresents an attractive modality to manage this high‐risk group of patients.

### Anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: national database insights [^112ac5CA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly used in patients with aortic stenosis; however, the optimal postoperative anticoagulation therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between anticoagulant therapy selection and outcomes in patients with AF after TAVR.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with AF who underwent TAVR. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the anticoagulant therapy administered 3 months after the index TAVR (direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC] and vitamin K antagonist [VKA] groups). The primary end points were thromboembolic and major bleeding events after a landmark period of 3 months. We analyzed the association between oral anticoagulants and outcomes using propensity score matching.

Results

Among 47 883 patients who underwent TAVR between April 2014 and March 2021, 10 041 had a history of AF and anticoagulant therapy. Of these, 8191 patients were prescribed a DOAC, while 1850 received a VKA. Before matching, the thromboembolic event rate was 2.2 per 100 person‐years in the DOAC group and 3.6 per 100 person‐years in the VKA group, whereas the bleeding event rates were 7.1 and 10.0 per 100 person‐years, respectively. After matching, VKA was associated with higher risks of thromboembolic events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46 [95% CI, 1.12–1.91]; P = 0.004) and bleeding events (HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.03–1.42]; P = 0.016).

Conclusions

DOAC use in patients with AF who undergo TAVR may be preferable to VKA use in a real‐world clinical setting.

### Management of atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: challenges and therapeutic considerations [^116Rc6h2]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is very common among patients with severe aortic stenosis. Moreover, new onset AF (NOAF) is a frequent finding after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). There is a significant impact of AF on outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR including mortality, thrombo-embolic and bleeding events. There is lack of clear evidence about the optimal management of AF in TAVR patients. This review aims to summarize the epidemiology, predictors, prognosis, therapeutic considerations and challenges in the management of AF in patients undergoing TAVR.

### Variation in antithrombotic therapy and clinical outcomes in patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons / American college of cardiology transcatheter valve therapy registry [^111gK4sb]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal antithrombotic management of patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement is challenging given the need to balance the risk of bleeding and thromboembolism. We aimed to examine variation in care and association of antithrombotic therapies with 1-year outcomes of stroke, bleeding, and mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with concomitant atrial fibrillation in the United States.

Methods

Patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with preexisting atrial fibrillation from November 2011 through September 2015 in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry linked to the Medicare database were examined according to receipt of oral anticoagulants (OACs) or antiplatelet therapies (APTs) or a combination of these (OAC+APT) at discharge. To assess the associations of antithrombotic therapies with 1-year outcomes of stroke, bleeding, and mortality, we utilized inverse probability weighting for antithrombotic therapies and multivariable regression modeling to adjust for patient- and hospital-level variables.

Results

In the 11382 patients included in our study, 5833 (51.2%) were discharged on OAC+APT, 4786 (42.0%) on APT alone, and 763 (6.7%) on OAC alone. There was significant variability in discharge medication patterns, including 42% of patients discharged without OAC therapy. In adjusted analyses, the risk for all-cause mortality and stroke was not significantly different when comparing the 3 different antithrombotic strategies. Risk of bleeding was higher with OAC+APT compared with APT alone (hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.05–1.27]) and similar compared with OAC alone (hazard ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.93–1.47]).

Conclusions

There was significant variability in discharge medication patterns across US sites in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, including significant underuse of OAC in this high-risk cohort. The use of OAC+APT (versus OAC alone or APT alone) was not associated with a lower risk of stroke or mortality but was associated with increased risk of bleeding complications at 1 year compared with APT alone.

### Duration of antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111abh8c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Selection of optimal antithrombotic regimens in patients with TAVR are complex because these patients are often at high risk for both bleeding and stroke because of older age and high burden of atherosclerotic comorbidities. Furthermore, concomitant presence of atrial fibrillation is common, and the selection of antithrombotic regimen becomes even more challenging. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 As such, various regimens including single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and oral anticoagulants have been used in patients after TAVR.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) has recently demonstrated that oral anticoagulant without concomitant use of antiplatelet had lower bleeding risk when the patient had clinical indication for oral anticoagulant (ie, atrial fibrillation). 8 Another study showed that SAPT had lower bleeding events compared with DAPT at 1 year in TAVR recipients. 9 Although there is an accumulating evidence for the regimen of antithrombotics in patients with TAVR, the optimal duration of antithrombotic remains largely under investigated. Current guidelines recommend DAPT for 3 to 6 months following TAVR 10, 11 but this is based on expert opinion and underlying evidence is scarce.

Herein, we conducted a network meta‐analysis to compare the outcome of antiplatelet‐based strategies based on different duration; SAPT versus DAPT for 3 months versus DAPT for 6 months, following TAVR.

### Leaflet immobility and thrombosis in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^117B8asd]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation

Currently, oral anticoagulation following TAVR is only recommended when there are other indications for anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation. In patients with surgical bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, the ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend anticoagulation with VKA and/or unfractionated heparin (UFH) as first-line therapy (Class I, level of evidence C). However, there are no guideline treatment recommendations for subclinical THV thrombosis in TAVR patients. It is increasingly recognized that anticoagulation with either VKA or NOAC, not DAPT, reduces the incidence and promotes the regression of THV thrombosis. For example, of the 58 patients who were diagnosed with THV thrombosis from the RESOLVE and SAVORY registries, all 36 patients who were anticoagulated for 3 months (24 with VKA and 12 with NOAC) had restoration of normal leaflet motion on follow-up MDCT. In the remaining 22 patients who were not anticoagulated, 20 patients had either persistent or progressive leaflet abnormality. Other smaller series also reported high proportion of patients with the resolution of THV thrombosis with anticoagulation.

### Antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter valve interventions: current status and future directions [^117UVLYR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The optimal antithrombotic strategy after transcatheter valve interventions is a subject of ongoing debate. Although there is evidence from randomized trials in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), current evidence on optimal antithrombotic management after transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve interventions is sparse. This article appraises the current evidence on this topic.

Methods

This narrative review presents key research findings and guideline recommendations, as well as highlights areas for future research.

Findings

After TAVR, randomized trial evidence suggests that single antiplatelet therapy is reasonable for patients without pre-existing indications for oral anticoagulation (OAC). If there is a concurrent indication for OAC, the addition of antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk. Whether direct oral anticoagulants achieve better outcomes than vitamin K antagonists is uncertain in this setting. Although OAC has been shown to reduce subclinical leaflet thrombosis (which may progress to structural valve degeneration), bleeding events are unacceptably high. There is a lack of randomized trial data comparing antithrombotic strategies after transcatheter mitral or tricuspid valve replacement or after mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Single antiplatelet therapy after mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may be appropriate, whereas at least 3 months of OAC is suggested after transcatheter mitral valve replacement or transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement.

Implications

Randomized studies are warranted to address the knowledge gaps in antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter valve interventions and to optimize outcomes.

Study Limitations

First, inherent limitations in using retrospective, observational data from the registry, including unmeasurable confounders, should be noted. The 1‐year outcomes data and data on prior bleeding are derived from CMS claims and are not adjudicated. Second, the analysis was based on the type of OAC at the time of discharge. Approximately 34.75% of patients with TAVR and AF were discharged on no OAC. It is possible that some of these patients started on OAC after discharge. Data on medication compliance, time in the therapeutic international normalized ratio range in the VKA group, the use of low‐molecular weight heparin as bridging therapy, and change or discontinuation of medication during follow‐up and crossover are not available. However, this limitation does not affect the scope of our findings as intention to treat analysis based on OAC treatment strategy at discharge was used in this study. Third, the patients with incident AF were less than 5% of the studied population and our results may not be generalizable for this patient subgroup. Fourth, despite including antiplatelet treatment in multivariate adjustment, the duration of antiplatelet treatment along with OAC is unknown. Fifth, the study included the patients from 2013 to 2018, before the current 2019 AF guidelines were published. Therefore, use of oral anticoagulation in the data set may not reflect current clinical practice. Finally, device thrombosis is one of the thromboembolic complications after TAVR. The median time from TAVR procedure to the diagnosis of device thrombosis is 181 daysbut only data on device thrombosis at 30 days were available for analysis. The 1‐year echocardiographic data evaluating the valvular function for the detection of subclinical device thrombosis were not available. However, symptomatic obstructive leaflet thrombosis after TAVR is rare and whether subclinical leaflet thrombosis is related to stroke or the progression to clinical leaflet thrombosis remains unknown.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement trials — atrial fibrillation prevalence and related surgical considerations: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement landmark trials, between one-third and one-half of patients presented with atrial fibrillation at enrollment, and in the 2 most recent low-surgical risk studies 15% to 18% had atrial fibrillation at baseline, most of whom in either arm did not receive treatment; on the basis of the general population and body of knowledge, it is safe to assume that atrial fibrillation is highly prevalent among patients being considered for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, and an STS database review demonstrated the very low risk of mitral valve repair surgery overall and the safety of adding surgical ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion without an increase in the short-term risk of morbidity and mortality.

1 INTRODUCTION

As the population ages, the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of aortic valve disease, particularly calcific aortic valve disease, has risen substantially, contributing significantly to the disease burden among the elderly. Patients with mild aortic stenosis (AS) may remain asymptomatic for many years. Once severe aortic stenosis develops, the symptoms and condition deteriorate, and conservative medical treatment tends to have a poor prognosis, quality of life, and long‐term survival unless surgery or intervention is performed. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is a traditional treatment for AS, but it is characterized by high surgical trauma and high surgical risk. Structural cardiac interventions have advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) emerging as an alternative treatment for patients with symptomatic AS, inoperable aortic valve stenosis, or high risk of SAVR. With the gradual maturity of TAVR therapy, the therapeutic effect has been significantly improved and the indications are becoming more and more extensive. For symptomatic severe AS patients with low surgical risk, there was no significant difference in all‐cause mortality, stroke or myocardial infarction, or prosthetic valve failure in patients after TAVR compared to those who received SAVR.

Shared decision-making factors for prosthetic valve choice (Table 22): Factors favoring a mechanical prosthesis include Age < 50 y, patient preference (avoid risk of reintervention), low risk of long-term anticoagulation, compliant patient with either home monitoring or close access to INR monitoring, other indication for long-term anticoagulation (eg, AF), and small aortic root size for AVR (may preclude ViV procedure in future). Factors favoring a bioprosthesis include Age ≥ 65 y, patient preference (avoid risk and inconvenience of anticoagulation), high risk of long-term anticoagulation, limited access to medical care or inability to regulate VKA, access to transcatheter ViV replacement, and TAVI valves have larger effective orifice areas for smaller valve sizes (avoid patient–prosthesis mismatch). AF indicates atrial fibrillation; INR, international normalized ratio; VKA, vitamin K antagonist; TAVI, transcatheter aortic valve implantation; ViV, valve-in-valve; AVR, aortic valve replacement.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^11358nXh]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the available data on antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In the absence of large randomised clinical trials, clinical practice is leaning towards evidence reported in other populations. Due to the greater risk of major bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation using a vitamin-K antagonist (VKA), antiplatelet therapy (APT) may be considered as the first-line treatment of patients undergoing TAVI. Overall, single rather than dual APT is preferred. However, dual APT should be considered in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ie, within 6 months), complex coronary stenting, large aortic arch atheromas or previous non-cardioembolic stroke. Monotherapy with VKA should be considered if concomitant atrial fibrillation or any other indication for long-term oral anticoagulation is present. APT on top of VKA seems only reasonable in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, extensive or recent coronary stenting or large aortic arch atheromas. A direct-acting oral anticoagulant may be considered if oral anticoagulation is indicated in the absence of contraindications. Initiation of VKA is indicated in clinical valve thrombosis, for example, with high transvalvular gradient, whereas the role of VKA in the case of subclinical leaflet thrombosis is currently uncertain.

Transcatheter valve replacement — Antiplatelet therapy is the standard antithrombotic regimen after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, whereas a combination of oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy has been used with transcatheter mitral valve replacement, although with scant supporting evidence; at the present time, DOACs are not routinely used in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement who have a TIA or ischemic stroke despite adequate antiplatelet therapy is still undefined.

### Managing patients with an indication for anticoagulant therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^1132WwJx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation are generally discharged on dual-antiplatelet therapy. However, many of these patients also have indications for anticoagulant therapy, and it is unclear what the best antithrombotic strategy is in these cases. Data from 360 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation were retrospectively analyzed, of whom 60 (16.7%) had indications for anticoagulant treatment, mainly because of atrial fibrillation. The antithrombotic regimen was decided according to clinical evaluation of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk; most of these patients (n = 43) were discharged with warfarin plus a single antiplatelet drug. Their outcomes were compared to those in a group with no indications for anticoagulation (n = 300) treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy. During the follow-up period (median 11 months), 53 patients (15%) died; mortality was not associated with antithrombotic regimen. The incidence of cerebral events or intracranial hemorrhage (4.6% and 1.1%, respectively) was low in the study population, and no significant differences were detected between groups; the bleeding rate was also unaffected by antithrombotic therapy. In conclusion, when anticoagulation is indicated after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, many variables must be taken into account. The most frequent scenario in this study was patients in atrial fibrillation, most of whom were discharged with warfarin plus a single antiplatelet medication. When bleeding was a concern, especially in the absence of coronary disease, warfarin alone was prescribed. These results suggest that this approach is safe, but data from larger, randomized studies are needed.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) — periprocedural cerebrovascular risk, anticoagulant choice, and antiplatelet regimens are detailed. New periprocedural cerebral ischaemic defects have been reported in more than 60% of patients, with clinically apparent stroke around 3% (range 0–6%); subacute cerebrovascular events occur between 24h and 30 days and 30-day stroke rates range from 0% to 8%. Concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) is present in 20–70% of patients and requires PCI in 20–40% of patients. For intraprocedural anticoagulation, the most commonly used anticoagulant is unfractionated heparin (UFH) at 50–70 IU/kg with an activated clotting time (ACT) target of 250–300 s, and given similar efficacy with higher cost of bivalirudin, UFH should remain the standard of care unless contra-indications to UFH exist. Among patients without CAD and without AF, the current standard is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg per day) and clopidogrel 75 mg qd after a 300–600 mg loading dose, both started within 24h and continued for 3–6 months followed by indefinite aspirin monotherapy. Single antiplatelet therapy soon after TAVI tended to reduce major adverse events with a significant reduction of major and life-threatening bleeding at three months, and a meta-analysis showed a significant reduction with a trend towards an increase in major bleeding, suggesting the opportunity to adopt antiplatelet monotherapy for patients without an indication for anticoagulation.

### Standard versus higher intensity anticoagulation for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement and additional risk factors for thromboembolism [^112iLLNY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend targeting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.5 for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and additional risk factors for thromboembolic events. Available literature supporting the higher intensity (INR) goal is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the association of standard and higher intensity anticoagulation on outcomes in this patient population. The Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative database was used to identify patients with mechanical AVR and at least one additional risk factor. Patients were classified into 2 groups based on INR goal: standard-intensity (INR goal 2.5) or higher-intensity (INR goal 3.0). Cox-proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios. One hundred and forty-six patients were identified of whom 110 (75.3%) received standard-intensity anticoagulation and 36 (24.7%) received higher intensity anticoagulation. Standard-intensity patients were older and more likely to be on aspirin. Atrial fibrillation was the most common additional risk factor for inclusion. The primary outcome of thromboembolic events, bleeding, or all-cause death was 13.9 and 19.5/100-person-years in the standard-intensity and higher intensity groups, respectively (adjusted HR 2.58, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 5.18). Higher-intensity anticoagulation was significantly associated with any bleeding (adjusted HR 2.52, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 5.00) and there were few thromboembolic events across both groups (5 events total). These results challenge current guideline recommendations for anticoagulation management of mechanical AVR in patients with additional risk factors.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126PcQn]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In the past decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have proven to be the best option for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, evidence for the use of DOACs for anticoagulation in valvular atrial fibrillation, particularly after aortic valve replacement, remains inadequate. Thus, we conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We conducted a comprehensive search of online databases, and 11 studies were included in the final analysis. The primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included stroke and cardiovascular death. The safe endpoint is major and/or life‐threatening bleeding. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to the different follow‐up time of each study. Random‐effects models were used for all outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using χ² tests and quantified using I² statistics. Patients in the DOACs group had a significantly lower risk of all‐cause mortality compared with patients in the VKAs group (relative risk [RR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.43, p = .04). This benefit may be greater with longer follow‐up. In a subgroup analysis based on the length of follow‐up, a significantly lower risk of all‐cause mortality was found in the DOACs group in the subgroup with a follow‐up time of > 12 months (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.07–2.09, p = .001). There were no significant differences between the two groups in cardiovascular death, stroke, and major and/or life‐threatening bleeding. For patients with atrial fibrillation after TAVR, the use of DOACs may be superior to VKAs, and the benefit may be greater with longer follow‐up. The anticoagulant strategy for atrial fibrillation after TAVR is a valuable direction for future research.

### Defining nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a quest for clarification [^1176E2p1]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation since the publication of the 4 major pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors. The definition of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is unclear, varying from one trial to another and even between North American and European guidelines, which is a source of uncertainties in clinical practice. However, many patients with atrial fibrillation present signs of valvular involvement, and clarification of this term is needed to not deny NOACs to patients based on the wrong perception that they may have valvular atrial fibrillation. The currently unique contraindications to NOACs are patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, as stated by the recent 2015 position paper of the European Heart Rhythm Association. Patients with native heart valve involvement, regardless of their severity, are suitable for NOAC therapy. Patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and mitral valve repair may be suitable for NOACs except for the first 3 and the first 3–6 months postoperatively, respectively. Patients with transaortic valve implantation or percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty are also considered as being eligible for NOACs, although the bleeding risk has to be carefully considered in this population often requiring a combination with antiplatelet therapy. Future studies are warranted to increase the level of evidence of use of NOACs, particularly in patients with transaortic valve implantation and valvular surgery, and to determine whether they could be used in the future in the only 2 remaining contraindications.

### Comparison of warfarin versus antiplatelet therapy after surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement [^111NCac4]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After aortic valve replacement (AVR), patients still experience excess mortality compared with the general population. The observed excess mortality can be partly attributed to morbidity related to the prosthesis and associated medication. Biological as compared with mechanical prostheses require less intensive antithrombotic therapy and are therefore the first-line choice in most patients undergoing surgical AVR.

The reported incidence of long-term thromboembolic events after aortic valve surgery with a bioprosthesis (bioSAVR) vary considerably, and generalisation of historical reports to current AVR cohorts must be done with caution. Patient characteristics have changed over the years with higher mean age, more atrial fibrillation (AF), concomitant coronary disease and comorbidities that contribute to increased risk of thromboembolic events yet with a lower 30-day mortality. There is a substantial amount of data supporting long-term oral anticoagulant treatment (OAC) after valve intervention in patients with AF but whether the majority of patients without prior AF benefit from OAC treatment is not established. In the absence of other indications for OAC, current guidelines recommend oral antithrombotic treatment with aspirin or warfarin for 3 months after bioSAVR. This recommendation is based on a low level of evidence and should be regarded as expert opinions only.

The occurrence of leaflet thrombosis and immobility in bioprostheses with the potential influence on the risk of ischaemic stroke has been increasingly recognised after both transcatheter AVR (TAVI) and bioSAVR. However, the true incidence is unclear and the clinical relevance of subclinical leaflet thrombosis is not well established. The incidence of thromboembolic events during the first 3 months after discharge is low and in some series the majority of valve thrombosis cases after SAVR occur > 1 year after implantation. Altogether, these data suggest that it might be beneficial to prolong the duration and/or intensity of antithrombotic treatment. On the contrary, bleeding risk increases with longer duration. In summary, there are conflicting opinions on the optimal antithrombotic treatment, including strategy and duration of treatment after intervention with a biological prosthesis. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different antithrombotic therapies to identify the antithrombotic regimen that yields highest possible balance between thrombotic and bleeding risks following bioSAVR.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulant and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the STS / ACC TVT registry [^112YT4VM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Thromboembolic and bleeding complications after TAVR have been the major concerns. The risk factors of stroke in TAVR vary based on the timing of stroke occurrence. Strokes that occur periprocedurally result from embolization of thrombus, calcification, and valve tissue/arterial wall‐derived debris, and the risk is potentially modifiable by the use of cerebral embolic protection devices. In subacute and late stroke, AF and systemic atherosclerosis are well‐known risk factors. However, the association of AF and late stroke is not consistent in some studies, raising the concern of leaflet thrombosis causing stroke in patients with TAVR. Although neither antiplatelet therapy nor OAC therapy was associated with the risk of 30‐day neurologic events in the recent study, the lack of OAC was associated with late ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (> 30 days postprocedure). Optimal antithrombotic management in patients undergoing TAVR with or without AF is still debated. The clinical trials in patients with TAVR with an indication for OAC are limited. The only clinical trial to assess the use of VKA versus DOAC (edoxaban) in patients with an indication for OAC after TAVR is ENVISAGE TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation). The study demonstrated that the outcomes of edoxaban use were comparable with warfarin use in all‐cause mortality, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage. However, the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban than with warfarin, mainly owing to more gastrointestinal bleeding. Several factors could possibly explain the difference in bleeding outcomes between ENVISAGE TAVI AF and our study. Endoxaban is the least commonly dispensed DOACs in the United States and apixaban is the most commonly dispensed DOACs. The different bleeding profiles in each DOAC, different antiplatelet protocol in ENVISAGE‐TAVI (dual antiplatelet for 3 months or single antiplatelet indefinitely), and the selected population for DOACs in our observational study could contribute to the different findings.

Definitions

The types of OAC at the time of discharge were denoted on the STS/ACC TVT Registry data collection form as VKA, dabigatran, and Factor Xa inhibitors. For the purpose of analysis, we classified patients who were discharged with an OAC into 2 groups: (1) VKAs and (2) DOACs (eg, dabigatran and Factor Xa inhibitors). CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were calculated using the data elements from the data collection form. Because not all the components in the HAS‐BLED risk score are captured by the TVT Registry, the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation bleeding score was used. Because the registry does not capture the data on the previous bleeding, we used CMS claims data for bleeding in the year before TAVR implantation using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) and Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) codes for the bleeding component of the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score. Administrative claims codes for each of these end points are given in Data S1.

Outcome Measures

We evaluated the safety and efficacy outcomes of DOACs compared with VKAs. The primary outcome was 1‐year stroke events. The secondary outcomes included both short‐ and long‐term outcomes. The long‐term secondary outcomes were 1‐year bleeding events, intracranial bleeding, and mortality. The short‐term secondary outcomes are the 30‐day incidence of device thrombosis, myocardial infarction, valve‐related readmission, nonvalve‐related readmission, and death. Thirty‐day outcomes were captured on the data collection form of the TVT Registry and the 1‐year outcomes were evaluated using CMS claims data. The 30‐day outcomes were reported to the TVT Registry using standardized definitions consistent with Valve Academic Research Consortium guidelines. The 1‐year outcomes were defined using the primary ICD‐9/ICD‐10 codes and procedure codes after the index hospitalization (Data S1).

Primary and Secondary End Points

The median follow‐up period after TAVR for all groups was 729 (interquartile range, 379–1184) days. Within the 3‐month landmark period, 461 patients (3.9 per 100 person‐years) experienced thromboembolic events, and 1375 patients (11.5 per 100 person‐years) experienced major bleeding. Among those with thromboembolic events, 394 had ischemic stroke and 67 had systemic embolism. Among those with major bleeding, 99 patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage and 340 had gastrointestinal bleeding.

The 3‐year clinical outcomes for the incidence of the primary and secondary end points before matching are shown in Table S2 and Figure S2. Both thromboembolic events (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.30–1.93]; P < 0.001) and major bleeding events (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.25–1.59]; P < 0.001) were higher in the VKA group. Each group included 1753 patients after matching. The absolute mean standardized differences for all baseline covariates were < 0.1 (Table 1). Thromboembolic events (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.12–1.91]; P = 0.004) and major bleeding events (HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.03–1.42]; P = 0.016) were higher in the VKA group (Table 2). Before matching, net adverse clinical events were higher in the VKA group (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.25–1.50]; P < 0.001). These results persisted after matching (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.04–1.32]; P = 0.006). Details of the net adverse clinical event components are presented in Table 2. We reported Aalen–Johansen curves considering all‐cause death as a competing risk in Figure S3. In addition, multivariable Fine–Gray models showed that VKA was associated with higher risk of thromboembolic events (HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.07–2.15]; P = 0.01) and major bleeding events (HR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.08–2.17]; P = 0.01).

### Amyloidosis and risk of stroke after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: It takes two to tango? [^11519P13]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke prevention in patients undergoing TAVR is a complex and unsolved issue, especially while expanding the indication to younger, low-risk populations. Occurrence of cerebrovascular events remains indeed an ominous complication after TAVR, with an incidence of 2% to 3% at 30 days. Risk factors for stroke after TAVI include patient-related and procedural-related factors that should guide periprocedural strategiesand optimal antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention. A high frequency of intracardiac thrombosis and high risk for thromboembolic events have been reported in CA patients, with progressive amyloid deposition leading to atrial myopathy, atrial electromechanical dissociation, and acute decompensated AS(Figure 1). This evidence motivated expert recommendations to anticoagulate CA patients with atrial fibrillation independently of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, and to perform imaging-guided cardioversion regardless of anticoagulation status. Whether routine anticoagulation should be also considered in systemic amyloidosis, and more specifically CA patients in sinus rhythm, when the atria are enlarged and dysfunctional, and the bleeding risk is low, is yet to be determined. Randomized trials assessing uninterrupted anticoagulation during TAVR, use of devices for cerebral embolic protection, and specific antithrombotic strategies after TAVR are awaited. In the absence of randomized data on the efficacy and safety of sequential valve- and amyloid-directed therapies in the setting of dual pathology, overall evidence calls for individualized treatment strategies that should come from Heart Team discussion with decisions based on patient life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, and shared decision-making according to patient values and preferences.

SCAI/HRS expert consensus — combined procedures with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) are not routinely recommended pending data from ongoing RCTs. In a report of 139 patients from 10 European centers undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation followed by WATCHMAN LAAC in the same setting, LAAC success was 100% with early (28 days) 98% freedom from PDL of > 5 mm; at 2-year follow-up, 92% were off oral anticoagulation (OAC) with a relative 84% cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack reduction compared with predicted in similar-risk patients not treated with OAC. The OPTION trial enrolled ~1600 patients 1:1 to either OAC or WATCHMAN FLX following AF ablation, with approximately one-third of devices placed concomitantly; results are anticipated 2023. The AMAZE study prospectively randomized patients 2:1 to percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LARIAT, SentreHEART) as an adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation and found that performing LAA ligation together with PVI was safe, with no reduction in recurrent AF compared with PVI alone. The WATCH-TAVR trial randomized 350 patients with aortic stenosis and AF to transcatheter aortic valve replacement and medical therapy versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement with concomitant WATCHMAN LAAC; results are anticipated 2023.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cPmhG]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of antithrombotic strategy after TAVR has been a hotly debated issue in the field. A meta‐analysis by Dr. Ueyama and colleagues included five studies comparing the safety and efficacy of DOACs versus VKAs in TAVR patients with an indication for anticoagulation, and they found that the risk of all‐cause mortality, bleeding, and stroke was similar between DOACs and VKAs. With the publication of RCT studies on antithrombotic strategies after TAVR, most notably the ATLANTIS study and the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF study, we have updated this topic. The ATLANTIS study investigated the feasibility of DOACs as an antithrombotic after TAVR compared to standard regimens. The ATLANTIS study showed that for all patients undergoing TAVR with or without an indication for oral anticoagulation, the efficacy of apixaban after TAVR was not superior to the current standard antithrombotic regimen in terms of net clinical benefit. The ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF study was designed to investigate the efficacy of edoxaban in patients with recurrent or new‐onset AF after TAVR. The primary endpoint event rate was not inferior to the VKAs group in the edoxaban group, but the incidence of major bleeding was higher than in the VKAs group, mainly due to more gastrointestinal bleeding in the edoxaban group. Compared with the previous meta‐analysis, we concluded that anticoagulation with DOACs in patients with TAVR combined with AF may be superior to VKAs, but we need more evidence to prove our point in the future, and the quest for the best antithrombotic treatment option after TAVR will continue.

Our meta‐analysis has several limitations. First, our study included two RCT, one CCT, and eight cohort studies. Although we adopted some quality evaluation methods, bias will inevitably occur, and more RCTs will be needed in the future to verify our conclusions. Second, some studies used antiplatelet drugs combined with anticoagulant therapy, while others did not. Due to limited data, we did not conduct a separate subgroup analysis. Also, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of the patient population, so the heterogeneity of the patient population should be considered when interpreting the study results. Finally, due to the lack of data, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of the types of DOACs and could not evaluate the individual category effect of each DOAC.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulant and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the STS / ACC TVT registry [^113L4gFX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical evidence on the safety and effectiveness of using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends and outcomes of using DOACs in patients with TAVR and atrial fibrillation.

Methods and Results

Data from the STS/ACC TVT (Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry was used to identify patients who underwent successful TAVR with preexisting or incident atrial fibrillation who were discharged on oral anticoagulation between January 2013 and May 2018. Patients with a mechanical valve, valve‐in‐valve procedure, or prior stroke within a year were excluded. The adjusted primary outcome was 1‐year stroke events. The adjusted secondary outcomes included bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and death. A total of 21 131 patients were included in the study (13 004 TAVR patients were discharged on a vitamin K antagonist and 8127 were discharged on DOACs.) The use of DOACs increased 5.5‐fold from 2013 to 2018. The 1‐year incidence of stroke was comparable between DOAC‐treated patients and vitamin K antagonist‐treated patients (2.51% versus 2.37%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81–1.23) whereas DOAC‐treated patients had lower 1‐year incidence of any bleeding (11.9% versus 15.0%; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89), intracranial hemorrhage (0.33% versus 0.59%; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33–0.87), and death (15.8% versus 18.2%; HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–1.00).

Conclusions

In patients with TAVR and atrial fibrillation, DOAC use, when compared with vitamin K antagonists, was associated with comparable stroke risk and significantly lower risks of bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and death at 1 year.

### Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement antithrombotic treatment in nonindicated patients: updated systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111NYJ1X]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a minimally invasive and efficient approach for treating symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who were considered high risk for traditional surgery. However, concerns regarding potential complications persist, ranging from thromboembolic events (eg, valve thrombosis) as well as bleeding caused by post-TAVR treatment to risks of mortality and cardiac death. This complexity makes post-TAVR antithrombotic therapy uniquely challenging, mainly as TAVR is currently used for patients with low surgical risk and those with no clear indication for anticoagulation. Recent evidence has shown that single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with aspirin offers more significant benefits than dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel by preventing ischemic complications and reducing the risk of bleeding in patients with no prior need for oral anticoagulants (OACs). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines recommend lifelong SAPT, preferably aspirin, as a class 2A strategy for post-TAVR patients without anticoagulation indications. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consistently suggests lifelong SAPT with aspirin or clopidogrel with a Class I recommendation for patients without a clear OAC indication. However, growing concerns about antiplatelet insufficiency in managing post-TAVR valve thrombosis have shifted attention to OACs, particularly vitamin K antagonists (VKA), which have proven more effective than DAPT in preventing valve thrombosis. Additionally, several studies have explored the benefits of direct OACs (DOAC) such as edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dual-agent therapy with rivaroxaban plus aspirin following TAVR, especially in reducing the risk of valve thrombosis. While DOACs effectively alleviated the risk of post-TAVR valve thrombosis, they did not show superiority over VKAs or antiplatelets in patients without clinical indications for OAC. Given the ongoing debates in this field, we aimed to utilize a comprehensive network meta-analysis to determine the safety and efficacy of different post-TAVR antithrombotic therapies in patients without a clear indication for anticoagulation.

Unlike previous studies, our results suggest a significantly lower bleeding risk (11.9% versus 15%; adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89; P < 0.001), intracranial hemorrhage (0.33% versus 0.59%; adjusted HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33–0.87; P = 0.011) and mortality risk (15.8% versus 18.2%; adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–1.00; P = 0.043) with DOACs. The findings mirror a favorable safety profile, with reductions in intracranial hemorrhage and mortality of DOAC when compared with VKA in the general population with AF. However, this finding should be applied to patients with TAVR and AF with caution. The benefits on bleeding in our study could be limited by the different baseline characteristics between the warfarin group and DOAC group as mentioned previously.

### Edoxaban versus standard of care and their effects on clinical outcomes in patients having undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation in atrial fibrillation-rationale and design of the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^115yWKH6]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation, also called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis and intermediate to high operative risk. A significant portion of TAVR patients have atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring chronic oral anticoagulation. In moderate- to high-risk AF patients, the direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban is noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less bleeding and cardiovascular deaths. ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (NCT02943785) is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation study comparing edoxaban to VKA-based therapy in approximately 1,400 patients with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation after successful transfemoral TAVR. The coprimary end points are to assess the differential effects of the 2 treatments (a) on net adverse clinical events (the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and major bleeding events) and (b) on major bleeding. Twelve hours to 5 days after successful TAVR, patients will be randomized to 60 mg daily oral edoxaban or any VKA (international normalized ratio: 2.0–3.0 or 1.6–2.6 [numbers inclusive] in Japan if age ≥ 70 years). Antiplatelet therapy may be administered per physician's discretion. Randomization will be stratified by edoxaban dose reduction (per local label). Treatment duration will be up to 36 months. The study is powered (80%) to detect noninferiority (margin for the hazard ratio: 1.38) for the composite primary end points, followed by superiority testing.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for pertinent studies published before September 28, 2021 using the following words: "DOAC OR NOAC OR anticoagulants OR edoxaban OR apixaban OR rivaroxaban OR dabigatran" AND "bioprosthesis OR transcatheter aortic valve OR TAVI OR TAVR". This review was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We retrieved data according to the PICOS framework: Population, patients with TAVR/TAVI; Intervention, NOAC (i.e. apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban); Comparison, VKA or warfarin; Outcome, all‐cause mortality or death, stroke, systemic embolism, major or life‐threatening bleeding; and Study type, RCTs or observational studies. There were no restrictions on publication year or language. Additionally, we searched for recent major cardiovascular meetings andfor further potential information.

2.2 Data extractions and risk of bias assessment

Two independent reviewers (L. L. and Y. F. C.) extracted relevant data. The following data were recorded from each trial: experimental design, basic information (sample size, mean age, proportion of males, proportion of AF, CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, HAS‐BLED score, STS score, duration of follow‐up, combination with antiplatelet therapy, and definition of outcomes), and original data (HRs of outcomes). The quality assessment of the studies was done independently by the two authors using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 toolfor RCTs and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus among all the authors.

2.3 Summary measures

The primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and stroke or systemic embolism. The safety of outcome was major and/or life‐threatening bleeding. Stroke or systemic embolism was defined as transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, arterial thromboembolism, and cerebrovascular events. We accepted the definition of major and/or life‐threatening bleeding from each study. The hazard ratios of each outcome were extracted for the meta‐analysis.

### The optimal management of anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement: certainties and uncertainties [^117ENEnm]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement encompasses a number of different situations. Long-term anticoagulation of mechanical prostheses uses vitamin K antagonists with a target international normalized ratio adapted to the characteristics of the prosthesis and the patient. The association of low-dose aspirin is systematic in the American guidelines and more restrictive in the European guidelines. Early heparin therapy is frequently used early after mechanical valve replacement, although there are no precise recommendations regarding timing, type, and dose of drug. Direct oral anticoagulants are presently contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthesis. The main advantage of bioprostheses is the absence of long-term anticoagulant therapy. Early anticoagulation is indicated after valve replacement for mitral bioprostheses, whereas aspirin is now favoured early after bioprosthetic valve replacement in the aortic position. Early dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, followed by single antiplatelet therapy. However, this relies on low levels of evidence and optimization of anti-thrombotic therapy is warranted in these high-risk patients. Although guidelines are consistent in most instances, discrepancies and the low-level of evidence of certain recommendations highlight the need for further controlled trials, in particular with regard to the combination of antiplatelet therapy with oral anticoagulant and the early post-operative anti-thrombotic therapy following the procedure.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^113hdVtZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-and low-risk patients [^114osG9T]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Young Patients Requiring a Mechanical Valve

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association focused guideline update on the management of patients with valvular heart disease lowered the age cutoff above which a bioprosthetic valve is reasonable to 50 years with a Class IIa recommendation. 27 In patients under the age of 50 years, the guideline still recommends a mechanical valve unless the patient has a clear contraindication to anticoagulation. There is nonetheless a trend toward increased use of bioprosthetic surgical valves even in patients under the age of 50 years, 28 often driven by patient preference and desire to avoid long‐term anticoagulation. Availability of newer mechanical valves that can safely be maintained with lower‐dose warfarin (target INR 1.5–2.0) and low‐dose aspirin 29 may convince more patients to select a mechanical prosthesis. Conversely, patients and physicians may feel more comfortable selecting a bioprosthesis because valve‐in‐valve TAVR is now an option if a surgical bioprosthesis fails in the future. 21 Irrespective of whether a mechanical valve or bioprosthesis is selected, aortic root enlargement surgery should be considered in patients with a small aortic annulus to prevent patient–prosthesis mismatch and facilitate TAVR valve‐in‐valve for the future.

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 1–5) state that disease stages in patients with valvular heart disease "should be classified (Stages A, B, C, and D) on the basis of symptoms, valve anatomy, the severity of valve dysfunction, and the response of the ventricle and pulmonary circulation". In evaluation, history and physical examination findings "should be correlated with the results of noninvasive testing (ie, ECG, chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram)", and if discordance exists, clinicians should "consider further noninvasive (computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, stress testing) or invasive (transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization) testing to determine optimal treatment strategy". For patients with valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (except those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis), the anticoagulation decision "with either a vitamin K antagonist or a non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, should be made in a shared decision-making process based on the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score", and those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis and atrial fibrillation "should receive oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist". Patients with severe valvular heart disease being considered for valve intervention "should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, with either referral to or consultation with a Primary or Comprehensive Valve Center". For severe aortic stenosis, treatment "with either a transcatheter or surgical valve prosthesis should be based primarily on symptoms or reduced ventricular systolic function", and "earlier intervention may be considered if indicated by results of exercise testing, biomarkers, rapid progression, or the presence of very severe stenosis".

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is effective in older patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, while the indication has recently broadened to younger patients at lower risk. Although thromboembolic and bleeding complications after TAVI have decreased over time, such adverse events are still common. The recommendations of the latest 2017 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease on antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing TAVI are mostly based on expert opinion. Based on recent studies and randomized controlled trials, this viewpoint document provides updated therapeutic insights in antithrombotic treatment during and after TAVI.

Valvular heart disease — bridging during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic valve patients — For bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF), it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against bleeding risk. For patients undergoing invasive procedures who have 1) a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis with risks of bleeding weighed against benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

DOAC indicates direct oral anticoagulation; and VKA, vitamin K antagonist.

The unadjusted cumulative incidence of outcomes from discharge date through 30 days and 1 year were examined using the log‐rank test and Kaplan‐Meier methods for death and using Fine and Gray's method to account for mortality as a competing risk for nonfatal outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models are reported to assess the impact of discharge medication on prespecified end points. The clinical variables proven in the literature to be related to the outcomes and P < 0.1 were considered in the adjusted model for primary and secondary outcomes and were listed in Table 2. Covariates, outcomes, and model structures for the adjusted analyses were prespecified and agreed upon a priori in the statistical analysis plan before generating any data. Significance was tested at a 2‐sided alpha level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed by the Duke Clinical Research Institute using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

### Results of mechanical versus tissue AVR: caution in young patients with tissue AVR [^112d6vPz]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

The first aortic valve prosthesis, implanted more than 50 years ago, was a mechanical prosthesis (ball-and-cage design). Over the ensuing decades, tissue prostheses and new mechanical designs were introduced to mitigate the need for anticoagulation with its associated side effects. Tissue and mechanical heart valve prostheses were compared in two head-to-head randomised control trials. Both of these confirmed that mechanical prostheses were durable but patients suffered anticoagulant-related bleeds. Patients who received a tissue prosthesis were more likely to suffer prosthetic dysfunction and require reoperation. This trend was stronger in younger patients. Since the publication of those two trials, several large retrospective studies using data from meta-analyses of published papers or registries have failed to show a survival advantage of either prostheses when implanted in the aortic position in younger patients. This equipoise has been reflected in the heart valve disease guidelines published by European and US societies. In recent years, the primacy of patient choice, the rapid increase in life expectancy of populations, the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation with requirement for anticoagulation, the advent of transcatheter techniques to treat degenerating tissue valves as well as advances in anticoagulant therapy and in new tissue and to a lesser extent mechanical prosthetic design continue to influence choice of aortic valve prosthesis in younger patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.

### Association between direct oral anticoagulant score and bleeding events in patients with atrial fibrillation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a retrospective multicenter cohort study [^115Xs7Dr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study demonstrates that the DOAC Score may serve as a reliable marker for predicting bleeding events in patients using VKAs and DOACs. A higher DOAC Score was associated with increased bleeding events, even among patients with AF using VKAs following TAVR. This finding holds clinical relevance, because the choice of OAC, that is, DOACs or VKAs, does not appear to influence bleeding events in patients with AF post‐TAVR. Recent randomized controlled trials have indicated that DOACs do not offer superior bleeding event reduction compared with VKAs in patients undergoing TAVR. Late bleeding events after TAVR in patients with AF are associated with poor prognosis. Identifying individuals at high risk of bleeding and adverse clinical outcomes is crucial for the management of AF after TAVR. Thus, our findings suggest that the DOAC Score is a valuable tool for clinicians managing patients with AF taking DOACs and VKAs. Furthermore, although the HAS‐BLED risk stratification was not effective in all 3 cohorts, we found that the DOAC Score was effective in the overall, DOAC, and VKA cohorts. This finding supports the use of the DOAC Score for bleeding risk stratification following TAVR in patients with AF, regardless of the type of OAC used. In a recent study, adjustment of DOAC dose was considered to contribute to the lower rates of bleeding in patients with small body size, mainly composed of an Asian cohort. The indications for DOAC dose reduction mainly include factors such as age, body size, and renal function. However, it may be reasonable to consider the very high‐risk group as one of the criteria for DOAC dose reduction. If patients are classified as having a very high bleeding risk, clinicians should avoid high‐dose prescription of DOACs, and the patients may be better managed with other options such as low‐dose DOACs or left atrial appendage closure without administering OAC therapy.

### Meta-analysis comparing direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^115YqMYX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common co-morbidity in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but whether direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) confer similar safety and efficacy compared with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) remains unclear in this population. The aim of our study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of DOACs compared with VKA in patients undergoing TAVI with concomitant indication of oral anticoagulation. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through October 2019 for studies comparing DOACs versus VKA in patients undergoing TAVI with indication of oral anticoagulation. The main efficacy outcomes were all-cause mortality and stroke whereas the main safety outcome was major and/or life-threatening bleeding. Our search identified 5 eligible studies including 2,569 patients. Majority of patients had atrial fibrillation as indication of anticoagulation. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality, major and/or life-threatening bleeding, and stroke in patients treated with DOACs versus VKA (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.73 to 1.57], p = 0.72, OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.64 to 1.12], p = 0.24, OR 1.52, 95% CI [0.93 to 2.48], p = 0.09, respectively). In conclusion, in patients undergoing TAVI with concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation, all-cause mortality, major and/or life-threatening bleeding, and stroke were similar between DOACs and VKA. Further large scale randomized controlled trials are needed to search the optimal oral anticoagulation regimen in this population.

### Rationale and design of the CREATE trial: a multicenter, randomized comparison of continuation or cessation of single antithrombotic therapy at 1 Year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112Aqkqh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend lifelong single antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement who have no indication for anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy. However, there is no direct evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting this practice. Furthermore, the optimal duration of antiplatelet therapy in this population has not been adequately investigated.

Methods and Results

CREATE (A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate Cessation of Antithrombotic Therapy at 1 Year in TAVR Patients–The CREATE Study) is a prospective, multicenter, open‐label, randomized controlled trial for patients who have undergone successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement and have no indication for long‐term oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Eligible patients are free from major bleeding and ischemic events for 1 year postprocedure before being randomized 1:1 to single antiplatelet therapy (control group) or no antiplatelet therapy (experimental group). The primary efficacy end point is the incidence of bleeding events, defined by the VARC‐3 (Valve Academic Research Consortium‐3) criteria, at 1‐year postrandomization. The primary safety end point is a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke at 1 year. The trial is powered for both superiority in efficiency and noninferiority in safety. Accordingly, a total of 3380 patients will be enrolled.

Conclusions

The CREATE trial aims to assess if stopping antiplatelet therapy at 1‐year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement reduces bleeding risk without increasing ischemic events in patients not requiring chronic antithrombotic therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^113y1CQm]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

3.4 Subgroup analysis

Due to moderate heterogeneity in the all‐cause death analysis, a subgroup analysis was performed. The 1‐ and 12‐month subgroup of patients with AF after TAVR showed no statistical difference in all‐cause mortality between patients using VKAs and DOACs. However, follow‐up over 12 months subgroup showed statistically significant differences between the VKAs and DOACs groups, with patients in the DOACs group having a significantly lower risk of all‐cause mortality (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.07–2.09, p = .001) (Figure 3B). There was significant heterogeneity in the result (I² = 60.72%, p = .05).

Conclusions

We found that the use of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines did not result in a reduction in the composite risk of stroke, SE, and death; yet, it was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. These results do not support the changes to anticoagulant therapy recommended by the 2014 guidelines; however, further research is needed to evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation in this cohort with low to moderate risk.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115DCmNA]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in valvular heart disease (VHD) — For patients with AF and native valve heart disease (except rheumatic mitral stenosis [MS]) or who received a bioprosthetic valve > 3 months ago, a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is an effective alternative to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation and should be administered on the basis of the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 A). For patients with AF and rheumatic MS, long-term VKA oral anticoagulation is recommended (1 C-EO). For patients with new-onset AF ≤ 3 months after surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, anticoagulation with a VKA is reasonable (2a B-NR). In patients with mechanical heart valves with or without AF who require long-term anticoagulation with VKA to prevent valve thrombosis, NOACs are not recommended (3: Harm B-R).

### Management of atrial fibrillation: updated guidance from the AHA… [^113NEQ5v]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Anticoagulation is recommended for AF at a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2 for men and 3 for women without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. The score has not been validated for mitral stenosis or mechanical valves.
- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. From the AFP Editors This guideline on atrial fibrillation management from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society is an update of the 2014 version and is based on new evidence from clinical trials and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.

Treatment recommendations apply to paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF as well as atrial flutter. In this update, the sections on anticoagulation, catheter ablation, and management of AF complicating acute coronary syndrome were modified, and new sections were added outlining weight loss and device detection of AF; however, this summary focuses on the new and revised recommendations for choosing an anticoagulant and new recommendations for preventing stroke via nonpharmacologic options and use of catheter ablation. Key Recommendations HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE Based on high-quality evidence, oral anticoagulants should be prescribed for women with AF and a CHA. Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve.

Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed. For patients taking warfarin, an international normalized ratio test is recommended at least every week at the start of treatment and monthly when stable within the recommended range. MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE A CHA₂DS₂-VASc score should be used to evaluate stroke risk in patients with AF who do not have moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score has not been validated in patients with mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves. Limited research supports using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to determine risk in patients with bioprosthetic valves. Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve.

Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve. Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Anticoagulant therapy is not necessary for men with AF and a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 0 or for women with AF and a score of 1, except in the presence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Warfarin or apixaban can be considered in men with AF, end-stage renal disease or on dialysis, and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of at least 2 and in women with AF, ESRD or on dialysis, and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of at least 3. Treatment with lower dosages of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor is an option for patients with AF, moderate or severe chronic kidney disease, and an increased CHA 2DS 2-VASc score.

### Direct oral anticoagulation for post-TAVI atrial fibrillation | NEJM resident 360… [^112Tibxz]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published October 27, 2021 Mr. Gannon is an 82-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the hospital and underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation. However, he developed postprocedural atrial fibrillation and was started on metoprolol for rate-control management. The decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin. However, interns on the team asked whether direct oral anticoagulants would be an appropriate substitute to reduce risk of thromboembolism. The prevalence of aortic stenosis in patients older than 75 years is about 12% and the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis is 3%. Complications of aortic stenosis include heart failure, angina, syncope, and atrial fibrillation.

For those with symptomatic aortic stenosis or asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement can reduce AVR can be achieved surgically or via transcatheter AVR, or more accurately referred to as transcatheter aortic valve implantation because the diseased native aortic value is not actually excised. The choice of TAVI versus SAVR is based on individual patient characteristics including comorbidities, age, expected length of survival, vascular access, and patient preferences. But for patients with high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI can reduce mortality, symptomatic aortic stenosis, and hospitalization. Postoperative complications associated with TAVI include stroke, paravalvular leak, stent migration, conduction abnormalities, and iliofemoral complications. Recommendations for antithrombotic prophylaxis after TAVI include aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin for at least 3 months.

The use of DOACs in patients with mechanical heart valves is contraindicated. However, the off-label use of DOACs in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves is increasingly common. Studies that compare the use of DOACs such as rivaroxaban to warfarin in patients with bioprosthetic mitral valve and atrial fibrillation report similar mortality, major cardiovascular events, or major bleeding events. Studies that compare rivaroxaban to antiplatelet therapy in adults without indication for oral anticoagulation after TAVI report increased mortality with rivaroxaban. In the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial, investigators randomized nearly 1400 individuals with severe aortic stenosis after TAVI and atrial fibrillation to receive edoxaban or warfarin. Nearly all patients had atrial fibrillation prior to TAVI or developed post-procedural atrial fibrillation. After a mean follow up of 1.

5 years, edoxaban was found to be noninferior to warfarin for the composite primary efficacy outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding. These results suggest that in patients such as the one described above with atrial fibrillation following TAVI with a bioprosthetic valve, edoxaban may be a reasonable alternative to warfarin. The following NEJM Journal Watch Summary provides further details of the study. Mark S. Link, MD, reviewing Van Mieghem NM et al. N Engl J Med 2021 Aug 28.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: guidelines from the American… [^112Phi9t]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces stroke risk and mortality with similar effectiveness as warfarin.
- Surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage during cardiac surgery reduces stroke risk with continued anticoagulation.
- Electrical cardioversion is more effective for acute rhythm control than medications.
- Catheter ablation reduces symptoms of AF, but it recurs in up to 40% of patients. From the AFP Editors Atrial fibrillation is expected to impact 12 million people by 2030 and increase mortality risk by at least 1. 5 times. It is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm caused by ectopic sources in the pulmonary veins of the left atrium or in response to reentrant cardiac conduction activity from interstitial fibrosis. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association released guidelines for managing patients with AF.

EVALUATION Clinical evaluation of newly diagnosed AF should include transthoracic echocardiography. Testing for cardiac ischemia and pulmonary embolism is recommended only if suggested by clinical presentation. SubscribeFrom $180

### Anticoagulation in frail patients with atrial fibrillation… [^117EucWo]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

With the increasing age and complexity of patients with atrial fibrillation, the role of frailty as a key driver of challenging management and poor prognosis has been increasingly acknowledged. Frailty is a clinical syndrome, defined by reduced physiological reserve and higher susceptibility to stressors, which bolsters the risk of adverse outcomes1; in clinical practice, frailty is entwined with aging and multimorbidity, thus entailing the so-called clinical complexity that often complicates management and prognosis in patients with AF. Current estimates suggest that up to 40% of patients with AF are frail, and previous studies have shown an overall suboptimal use of oral anticoagulant in these individuals. 1 Nonetheless, limited data are available on OACs in patients with AF who are frail, particularly regarding comparisons among.

different OACs: a 2022 Korean nationwide study showed an overall lower risk of adverse outcomes in patients treated with direct OAC compared with warfarin in patients with AF who are frail, 2 while an analysis of Medicare data found that apixaban was associated with lower rates of adverse events compared with warfarin among patients who are frail. 3 Notwithstanding this previous evidence, more data, particularly on comparisons among different DOACs, are still needed. This study by Lin and colleagues4 analyzed Medicare beneficiaries data to compare patients aged 65 years and older with AF who were treated with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin across frailty status.

After propensity score overlap weighting, Lin et al4 analyzed the association of OACs with different outcomes, including a composite clinical end point of death, thromboembolic events, and major bleeding; health care costs; and the risk of more than 14 days of home time lost, where home time was defined as the number of days in which patients were alive and not in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. During a 1-year follow-up, Lin et al4 found that apixaban was associated with a lower rate of the clinical composite end point and a lower risk of home time lost compared with rivaroxaban and warfarin; these reductions were greater in patients with AF who were frail compared with patients who were not frail. Apixaban was also associated with lower health care costs compared with rivaroxaban; conversely, lower total costs were observed with warfarin, although different results were observed when excluding the OAC cost.

These results expand previous observations and have important clinical implications. Indeed, different from previous studies, Lin et al4 focused not only on clinical end points but also on the impact of OAC choice on health care costs and, more importantly, on a patient-centered outcome that has clear relevance for both patients and their families. The results presented by Lin et al4 are relevant also considering the strong impact of frailty in determining the risk of rehospitalization and nonhome discharge. 5 Indeed, the findings of the study by Lin et al4 provide a head-to-head comparison among apixaban, rivaroxaban and warfarin in.

### Atrial fibrillation [^11795apX]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation frequently results from bursts of tachycardia that originate in muscle bundles extending from the atrium to the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation by transcatheter ablation can restore sinus rhythm. The ganglionated plexi can also be a source of atrial fibrillation, and are sometimes also ablated for that reason. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as weight loss in people with obesity, increased physical activity, and drinking less alcohol, can lower the risk for AF and reduce its burden if it occurs. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near-normal range or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm. Electrical cardioversion can convert AF to normal heart rhythm and is often necessary for emergency use if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people.

For those at low risk of stroke, AF does not necessarily require blood-thinning though some healthcare providers may prescribe an anti-clotting medication. Most people with AF are at higher risk of stroke. For those at more than low risk, experts generally recommend an anti-clotting medication. Anti-clotting medications include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. While these medications reduce stroke risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Using genome-wide association study, which screen the entire genome for single nucleotide polymorphism, three susceptibility loci have been found for AF. In these loci there are SNPs associated with a 30% increase in risk of recurrent atrial tachycardia after ablation.

A 2018 meta-analysis of GWAS studies identified 97 locis associated with AF, of which 70 were newly identified associations: they are associated with genes that encode transcription factors, such as TBX3 and TBX5, NKX2–5 or PITX2, involved in the regulation of cardiac conduction, modulation of ion channels and in cardiac development. Hypertension Hypertension is reportedly present in 49% to 90% of patients with atrial fibrillation. According to the CHARGE Consortium, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are predictors of the risk of AF. Systolic blood pressure values close to normal limit the increase in the risk associated with AF. Diastolic dysfunction is also associated with AF, which increases left atrial pressure, left atrial volume, size, and left ventricular hypertrophy, characteristic of chronic hypertension. All atrial remodeling is related to heterogeneous conduction and the formation of re-entrant electric conduction from the pulmonary veins.

Medications Several medications are associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Few studies have examined this phenomenon, and the exact incidence of medication-induced atrial fibrillation is unknown. Medications that are commonly associated with an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation include dobutamine and the chemotherapy agent cisplatin. Agents associated with a moderately increased risk include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates, and other chemotherapeutic agents such as melphalan, interleukin 2, and anthracyclines. Other medications that rarely increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation include adenosine, aminophylline, corticosteroids, ivabradine, ondansetron, and antipsychotics.
