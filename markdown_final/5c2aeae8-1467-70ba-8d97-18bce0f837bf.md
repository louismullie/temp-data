## Question

Macrocytic anemia from cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis, including its mechanisms, diagnostic approach, prognostic implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how macrocytosis and macrocytic anemia are defined and how often they occur in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the multifactorial pathophysiology, distinguishing megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic causes. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including pitfalls and when to pursue bone marrow evaluation. After that, I should appraise the prognostic data linking macrocytosis to disease severity. Finally, I will outline management principles, including when to transfuse, how to replete deficiencies, and how to address portal hypertensive bleeding and special scenarios like spur cell anemia, while double-checking guideline-backed recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and epidemiology so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Macrocytosis is typically defined as MCV greater than 100 fL, and macrocytic anemia implies anemia with that MCV threshold; in cirrhosis cohorts, macrocytosis is common, with reports around 30–32% and higher prevalence in more severe disease, and anemia overall affects roughly 75% of patients with advanced liver disease, underscoring the clinical relevance of this phenotype [^1713d8a2] [^664e379b] [^0282cc73].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check the multifactorial mechanisms. Non-megaloblastic processes predominate in cirrhosis: membrane cholesterol loading enlarges RBCs, hypersplenism shortens RBC lifespan with a compensatory reticulocytosis that raises MCV, and alcohol has direct marrow toxicity and nutritional effects; megaloblastic features from B12/folate deficiency can coexist, especially with alcohol use or malabsorption, but classic oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils are less universal in cirrhosis than in isolated vitamin deficiencies, so I should verify smear morphology carefully [^8f03b436] [^0282cc73] [^1713d8a2].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss reversible causes. I should confirm true macrocytosis with a reticulocyte count and a peripheral smear to distinguish megaloblastic from non-megaloblastic forms, then check B12, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and folate; in cirrhosis, ferritin and transferrin saturation are often confounded by inflammation, so I need to interpret iron studies cautiously and consider marrow iron when the diagnosis remains uncertain, particularly if I suspect iron deficiency or sideroblastic processes [^1713d8a2] [^fee66757] [^a9cf8c88].

> I should double-check the prognostic implications before overinterpreting a single MCV value. Multiple cross-sectional studies in HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis show macrocytic anemia correlates with higher MELD scores and worse short-term outcomes, and broader cirrhosis cohorts demonstrate that lower hemoglobin and higher MCV track with more severe liver disease by MELD and Child-Pugh; however, these are observational and cannot establish causality, so I need to communicate uncertainty while acknowledging the consistent signal [^253805c0] [^a3f78442] [^5419c965] [^5cee9529].

> Next, I should review management principles, and I need to ensure I'm aligned with guidelines. First, do not transfuse prophylactically for procedures solely to "correct" anemia; transfuse only for symptomatic anemia or when hemoglobin is around 8 g/dL or less, balancing bleeding risk and comorbidities, and remember that raising hematocrit toward 25% can improve platelet margination and hemostasis in active bleeding contexts [^0b7d06e1] [^13c2a7b7]. Second, correct reversible deficiencies: screen for and replete iron, folate, B12, and B6, especially if the patient is decompensated or facing invasive procedures, and consider empiric multivitamins in those with frailty or sarcopenia given high rates of micronutrient deficiency in cirrhosis [^dfe98036] [^f17d3af8] [^deb4f54d]. Third, address portal hypertensive sources of iron loss: treat portal hypertensive gastropathy with nonselective beta-blockers and escalate to TIPS if transfusion-dependent anemia persists despite medical therapy, while also managing varices per standard protocols [^96cac17d] [^044c32cb].

> But wait, what if the macrocytosis reflects hemolysis or a marrow process rather than nutrition or membrane changes. I should confirm with LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin, and if spur cell hemolysis is suspected in advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, I must recognize its poor prognosis and limited options beyond supportive care, liver transplantation, or case-report-level steroid trials; conversely, if cytopenias are unexplained or persistent, I should consider bone marrow evaluation to exclude myelodysplastic syndrome after correcting deficiencies, keeping in mind that MDS-related anemia is typically macrocytic and hypoproliferative with suboptimal EPO response [^bb40a289] [^322a30d1] [^d60b0a7f].

> I need to ensure I close the loop on special pitfalls. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be normal or high despite iron deficiency in cirrhosis, so low ferritin is specific but normal or high ferritin is not; transferrin saturation and, when needed, marrow iron or hepcidin can help adjudicate, and in complex cases, collaboration with hematology is prudent to avoid misclassification and to guide therapy, including when to consider parenteral iron or when to suspect iron-loading anemias that require chelation rather than iron repletion [^a9cf8c88] [^3a9c6eef] [^55f9b5b2].

> In summary, macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis is common and multifactorial, with non-megaloblastic mechanisms predominating but megaloblastic causes still important to exclude; it correlates with disease severity and worse outcomes, though causality remains unproven; management hinges on confirming true macrocytosis, correcting deficiencies, avoiding unnecessary transfusions, and treating portal hypertensive sources of blood loss, with a low threshold to evaluate for hemolysis or marrow disease when the story doesn't fit [^0282cc73] [^253805c0] [^dfe98036] [^0b7d06e1].

---

Macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis is **multifactorial**, driven by nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate), hemolysis/reticulocytosis, and altered RBC membrane lipids [^8f03b436] [^573be17a]. It correlates with **severity of liver disease** and higher MELD scores, indicating worse prognosis [^253805c0] [^5419c965]. Diagnosis relies on CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, and B12/folate levels; management focuses on correcting deficiencies, treating hemolysis, and avoiding unnecessary transfusions [^1713d8a2] [^dfe98036] [^0b7d06e1].

---

## Pathophysiology

Macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: B12 and folate deficiency from poor intake, malabsorption, and alcohol-related mucosal injury [^0282cc73] [^573be17a].

- **Hemolysis and reticulocytosis**: Shortened RBC lifespan and reticulocytosis increase MCV [^8f03b436] [^53f49cdd].

- **Altered RBC membrane lipids**: Cholesterol loading of RBC membranes in liver disease increases cell size [^8f03b436] [^9091917f].

- **Bone marrow dysfunction**: Direct toxic effects of alcohol and chronic inflammation impair erythropoiesis [^573be17a] [^4cd75a0c].

---

## Clinical significance

Macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis is **clinically significant** because it correlates with disease severity and prognosis. Higher MCV is associated with higher MELD scores and worse outcomes, including increased mortality [^253805c0] [^5419c965]. It also reflects the underlying pathophysiology of cirrhosis, including nutritional deficits, hemolysis, and marrow dysfunction [^0282cc73].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential to identify causes and guide therapy:

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear | Confirm macrocytosis; assess hemolysis, morphology [^1713d8a2] |
| 2 | Serum B12, folate, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine | Identify deficiency [^fee66757] |
| 3 | Liver function tests, MELD score | Assess liver disease severity [^5a30e4fe] |
| 4 | Consider bone marrow biopsy | If unexplained macrocytosis or cytopenias persist [^322a30d1] |

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **correcting underlying causes**:

- **Nutritional repletion**: Treat B12/folate deficiencies with supplementation [^dfe98036].

- **Address hemolysis**: Manage spur cell anemia and other hemolytic processes; consider steroids in select cases [^bb40a289].

- **Avoid unnecessary transfusions**: Transfuse only for symptomatic anemia or hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL, given risks of volume overload and iron overload [^notfound].

- **Monitor and reassess**: Track response to therapy and adjust as needed [^deb4f54d].

---

## Prognostic implications

Macrocytic anemia is a marker of **advanced liver disease** and worse prognosis. Higher MCV correlates with higher MELD scores and increased short-term mortality, making it a useful prognostic indicator in cirrhosis [^253805c0] [^5419c965].

---

Macrocytic anemia in cirrhosis is **common and multifactorial**, reflecting nutritional deficits, hemolysis, and marrow dysfunction. It signals more severe liver disease and worse outcomes, so a structured diagnostic and targeted management approach is essential to improve patient care.

Conclusions

Macrocytic anemia was found to be associated with the severity of liver impairment and might be a predictor for short-term mortality in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. However, a large-scale cohort study is recommended to confirm the present results and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed correlations between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^8f03b436]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The importance of macrocytic anemia or macrocytosis seems to be underestimated in the past. Only a few studies focused on its risk of adverse events or death. Among these studies, Yoon et al. documented that the elevated MCV level was associated with increased liver cancer mortality in men; this finding was consistent with the result of our study. A small-sample study also found a markedly higher MCV in patients with chronic liver failure than in healthy subjects. These observations, though not directly, provided evidence for our conclusion that patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis who have macrocytic anemia were more likely to present worse liver condition.

There are several potential pathological mechanisms that explain why macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment. First, patients with advanced liver damage are more likely to have vitamin B 12 or folate deficiencies, which directly result in macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B 12 and folate coenzymes are required for thymidylate and purine synthesis, thus, their deficiencies result in retarded DNA synthesis and eventually will develop into macrocytic anemia. Second, macrocytic anemia in liver disease may be due to an increased deposition of cholesterol on the membranes of circulating RBCs. This deposition effectively increases the surface area of the erythrocyte. Third, hemolytic anemias are common in advanced liver failure. In this case, excessive destruction of RBCs and increased reticulocyte count can be observed. The immature erythrocytes are approximately 20% larger compared to the mature erythrocytes, which result in macrocytic anemia. Moreover, erythrocyte morphology is affected by various factors in liver disease, such as causes, degree of liver damage, and drugs used. Complicated mechanisms, which allow the synchronized performance of their independent or collaborative functions, determine the shape of RBCs. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that there is a positive correlation between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

Discussion

In this retrospective study, we demonstrated that macrocytic anemia, defined as anemia in which the RBCs are larger than their normal volume (100 fL), is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. This finding remains substantial even after adjusting for demographics and laboratory parameters, such as age, gender, smoking, drinking and total cholesterol.

An MCV level greater than 100 fL, which is also known as macrocytosis, may not always be associated with anemia. Moreover, it presents independently from anemia in most cases. Nevertheless, we chose anemia as one of our inclusion criteria because 84.2% of the 1445 pre-screened patients have anemia. This result was consistent with the finding of another study, which reported that about 75% of patients with chronic liver disease have a diverse aetiology of anemia. Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis may have anemia due to a lack of haematopoietic factors, shortened erythrocyte survival, reduced bone marrow function, or gastrointestinal bleeding. All these conditions indicate impaired liver function and a high risk of mortality. Therefore, patients without anemia were excluded from the data analysis to avoid potential bias in our present study.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^5cee9529]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis and macrocytic anemia are associated with the severity of liver disease. In a study conducted by Yang et al, macrocytic anemia was associated with the severity of liver disease in patients with decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B. The MELD score was used to assess the severity of liver disease in this study. In another study conducted by Yoon et al, elevated MCV levels were associated with greater liver cancer mortality in men.

Of the 58 patients who had macrocytosis, only 29 had low serum B12 levels. Acute and chronic liver disease is associated with higher serum B12 levels, and this has been attributed to the release of vitamin B12 from the liver as a result of hepatocellular necrosis and increased binding of B12 with serum proteins. In addition, higher B12 levels are associated with severe liver disease and prognosis.

In conclusion, in our study we found a significant correlation between the MELD score and the degree of anemia. A higher MELD score was associated with more severe hematological complications. Whether the correction of anemia in such patients at an early stage will retard the progression of disease is debatable and requires further studies. However, lower Hb levels were definitely associated with more severe forms of liver cirrhosis, as was established by the correlations with MELD score and CTP class in this study. Larger studies will be needed to assess whether Hb should be used as a marker for the severity of liver disease. The reverse is also true: MELD score can be used effectively to predict hematological complications in such patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Anemia in liver cirrhosis is multifactorial and the most common complication encountered
Hemoglobin levels decrease with an increase in the severity of liver disease
Macrocytosis is also associated with greater severity of liver disease

What the new findings are:

In this study there was a significant negative correlation between model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and hemoglobin levels
Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) scores also showed that hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CTP class C patients
Macrocytosis was significantly higher in patients with MELD scores > 12

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^5a30e4fe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is an end-stage disease that invariably leads to death. It is the 14th most common cause of death in adults worldwide and results in 1.03 million deaths per year. Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of cirrhosis and 30% of deaths are attributable to HBV. China is a highly endemic area of HBV, where 78% of patients with cirrhosis are HBsAg positive. In patients with cirrhosis, the 5-year probability of decompensation is 15–20%, while the 5-year survival rate decreases from 84 to 14–35% once clinical decompensating events occur.

Anemia is a common comorbidity in cirrhosis that is associated with poor prognosis. Erythrocyte abnormalities were clinically important and frequent findings in patients with chronic disease. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), a measurement of the average volume of red blood cells (RBCs), has been documented to be associated with an increase in many clinical conditions. Typically, anemia can be classified into macrocytic anemia (> 100 fL), normocytic anemia (80–100 fL), and microcytic anemia (< 80 fL) based on the patient's MCV level. A recent study has reported that the elevated MCV level was associated with increased liver cancer mortality, especially in men who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that a common association might exist between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

We used the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for evaluating the severity of liver impairment of HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. The MELD score was developed to predict the short-term mortality of end-stage liver disease because of the shortage of donated livers. It had been validated subsequently as an accurate predictor of survival among different populations of patients with advanced liver disease and was adopted for organ allocation for liver transplantation instead of the older Child-Pugh score in the USA since 2002. Liver transplantation is generally recommended for patients with MELD score of > 15, if possible.

The goal of the present study is to investigate whether the MELD score is higher in the macrocytic anemia group in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^c8c30a3f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

All patients were classified into 4 groups according to their anemia typing (microcytic, macrocytic, normocytic and dimorphic anemia). Patients were further subclassified according to their MELD scores (Group A < 12 and Group B > 12) and CTP class (Child A, B and C). Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations of the MELD score and CTP score with Hb levels and macrocytosis. Variables with a P-value < 0.05 in univariate models were then included in the multivariate analyses. A 2-tailed test was used to calculate the P-value, and the results were considered statistically significant when the P-value was < 0.05.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^5419c965]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Anemia is more severe in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis and can be a predictor of the severity of liver disease.

Methods

In this cross-sectional observational study, we included 181 cirrhotic patients with anemia owing to liver cirrhosis and its complications. The population was divided into 2 groups based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the severity of anemia was assessed in the 2 groups. Similarly, hemoglobin levels were assessed in 3 groups based on the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification.

Results

There was a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and hemoglobin (P < 0.001), with the lowest hemoglobin levels in CTP C patients. The correlation coefficient between hemoglobin and MELD score was -0.671 and was statistically significant, establishing that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver cirrhosis. Of 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 patients (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This study shows that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver disease; thus, this measure can be used in the initial assessment of patients to give a picture of the severity of the disease. A larger prospective trial is needed to establish the use of hemoglobin levels for assessing severity and predicting mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Association between macrocytic anemia and MELD score

Patients in the macrocytic group had evidently higher MELD scores than patients in the other two groups (Fig. 2). In univariate regression analysis, we found that there was a significant association between macrocytic anemia and the MELD score (estimated coefficient = 2.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.59–4.01, P value [P] < 0.001), using the normocytic group as the reference. Furthermore, the association remained robust (β = 1.94, CI: 0.81–3.07, P < 0.001) after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, drinking and total cholesterol in multivariate analysis (Table 2).

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^4ac6721e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This was a cross-sectional observational study carried out at a tertiary care hospital in Western India. The primary objective was to establish an association between the severity of liver cirrhosis, defined by the MELD score and Hb levels; secondary objectives were to examine the prevalence of various patterns of anemia in liver cirrhosis and assess the relation between macrocytosis and the severity of liver cirrhosis. A total of 181 patients admitted with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis from January 2019 to April 2019 were enrolled in this study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee and all the participants gave written informed consent.

Inclusion criteria were: age > 18 years; liver cirrhosis, irrespective of etiology; and Hb < 13 g/dL in males and < 12 g/dL in females.

Exclusion criteria were: patients who received blood transfusion in the past 3 months; those already on therapy for anemia; presence of chronic kidney disease; and any other etiology of anemia not attributable directly or indirectly to liver cirrhosis.

Liver cirrhosis was defined on the basis of clinical and radiological evidence, such as elastography and ultrasound. Complications, such as ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and upper GI bleeding, were also documented. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization's criteria (Hb < 13 g/dL in males and < 12 g/dL in females). A total of 181 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.

All patients underwent thorough history taking and physical examination. Investigations included complete blood counts with platelets, mean corpuscle volume (MCV: < 80 fL = microcytic anemia, > 98 fL = macrocytic anemia), peripheral blood smear for anemia typing, serum iron studies, serum B12 levels, liver function tests, including prothrombin time (INR), abdominal ultrasound, ascitic fluid analysis and upper GI endoscopy. MELD score was calculated using the formula 9.57 × logₑ(creatinine mg/dL) + 3.78 × logₑ(bilirubin mg/dL) + 11.2 × logₑ(INR) + 6.43, where 6.43 is the constant for liver disease etiology. The Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score was also calculated for all the patients.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^a3f78442]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Macrocytic anemia is common in liver disease. However, its role in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related decompensated cirrhosis remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis according to the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.

Methods

A total of 463 participants who fulfilled our criteria were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Patients were classified into three groups according to anemia types, diagnosed based on their mean corpuscular volume level. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine the association between macrocytic anemia and the MELD score for patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

Results

Patients with macrocytic anemia had evidently higher MELD scores (10.8 ± 6.6) than those with normocytic anemia (8.0 ± 5.5) or microcytic anemia (6.3 ± 5.1). The association remained robust after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, drinking, and total cholesterol (β = 1.94, CI: 0.81–3.07, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Macrocytic anemia was found to be associated with the severity of liver impairment and might be a predictor for short-term mortality in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^4086c7ca]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition, we used the MELD score, which is a formula comprising creatinine, bilirubin, and INR values, to evaluate the severity of liver impairment and risk of death. In our study, patients with macrocytic anemia had higher levels of bilirubin and INR, but no significant difference was observed in creatinine levels and eGFR. Thus, macrocytic anemia might be unrelated to kidney damage in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

There were a few limitations in this study. First, we used the MELD score for evaluating the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. Although the MELD score could provide an accurate prediction of short-term mortality of patients with cirrhosis, a follow-up data might be better and more credible. Second, the analysis did not include data on serum vitamin B 12, folate, reticulocyte count, drugs, and measures of haemolysis, which could contribute to better understand the mechanisms of macrocytic anemia in patients with cirrhosis.

Results

Patient characteristics

Among the 181 patients enrolled 168 were males and 13 were females. The mean age was 49.7 years. Alcohol was the most common etiology (166 patients), followed by cryptogenic (12 patients), Budd–Chiari syndrome (2 patients) and hepatitis B (1 patient).

Distribution of anemia types

The mean Hb levels in males and females were 10.51 g/dL and 10.48 g/dL, respectively. Macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL) was seen in 58 (32%) patients. On anemia typing, a total of 93 (51.4%) patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 56 (30.9%) had macrocytic anemia, 29 (16.0%) had microcytic anemia and 3 (1.7%) had dimorphic anemia (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic profile

Of the patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS, only 1 had iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin < 16 µg/L in males and < 10 µg/L in females). Of the patients who had macrocytic anemia on PBS, 29 had low serum B12 levels (< 220 ng/mL).

Macrocytosis and MELD score

Of the 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^21c2c075]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.1.3). Continuous data were presented as mean ± SD, and categorical variables were presented as count and percentage. All participants were divided into three groups according to their anemia classification. We used one-way ANOVA to determine the differences among the three groups in terms of the continuous variables, because the variables were all normally distributed and homogeneous in variance. Simultaneously, the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the associations of the MELD score with macrocytic anemia. Variables with P value < 0.05 in univariate models were then included in the multivariate analyses. A two-tailed test was used to calculate the P value, and the results were considered statistically significant when the P value < 0.05.

Discussion

In our study, 51.4% of the patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 30.9% had macrocytic anemia, 16.0% had microcytic anemia and 1.7% had dimorphic anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, based on MCV and low serum ferritin levels, was seen only in 1 of 29 patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS. However, the interpretation of routine lab parameters such as serum ferritin is extremely difficult in liver cirrhosis, and bone-marrow staining for iron with Prussian blue is required for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

A total of 58 patients had macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL); of these, 56 had macrocytic anemia on PBS and 2 had dimorphic anemia. The remaining 51.4% of patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, the most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. We also found a significant correlation between MELD score and macrocytosis.

In our study there was a significant correlation between the MELD score and Hb levels. Lower Hb levels were associated with a higher MELD score. Similar findings were seen in a study conducted by Scheiner et al, where anemic patients showed a higher MELD (12 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 3; P < 0.001). In a study conducted by Jain et al, 88 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis were divided into 5 groups according to their MELD scores. It was found that hematological abnormalities, such as anemia and leucopenia, were more common in the higher MELD score group. Studies have shown that anemia is a poor prognostic factor in patients with liver cirrhosis, and the severity of anemia increases with the stage of liver disease.

We also found a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and Hb. Patients with Child C classification had lower Hb levels compared to those with Child A or B.

Methods

Study population

From May 2013 to July 2016, data of 1445 patients diagnosed as having HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis were extracted from the HIS Database at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. For patients to be diagnosed as having HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis, the following conditions must be present: HBsAg carrier for ≥ 6 months; pathological or clinical evidence of cirrhosis; and occurrence of complications, such as ascites, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or hepatic encephalopathy. Anemia was defined according to WHO's haemoglobin thresholds, which is haemoglobin level of < 130 g/L in male and < 120 g/L in female. After strictly screening according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, 463 patients were enrolled in this hospital-based cross-sectional study (Fig. 1). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. Since this is a retrospective study, a written consent is waived by the Ethics Committee and is deemed unnecessary. All methods were carried out in accordance with appropriate clinical practice guidelines and national legal requirements.

Flow diagram for the selection of patients

Data collection

Demographic characteristics were obtained from an interview during the patients' admission to our hospital. Venous blood samples were collected from the participants after an overnight fasting for laboratory assessments. Smoking was defined as having ≥ 1 cigarette per day and drinking was defined as alcohol intaking > 20 g per day for at least a year. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using a formula adapted from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Unfortunately, body mass index (BMI) and HBV DNA data were not included in the analysis due to excessive missing values.

MELD score

The MELD score was calculated using the following formula: 9.57 × logₑ(creatinine mg/dl) + 3.78 × logₑ(bilirubin mg/dl) + 11.2 × logₑ(INR) + 6.43, where INR is the international normalised ratio and 6.43 is the constant for liver disease aetiology.

Results

Characteristics of participants

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the participants, which were divided into three groups according to anemia types. Among the 463 eligible participants, 304 had normocytic anemia, 123 had macrocytic anemia and 36 had microcytic anemia. The average age of participants was 54.3 (SD = 7.3) years and 63.5% of them were male. Our data showed that patients with macrocytic anemia were older and had higher levels of bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) compared to patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. MELD score was also observed to be higher in the macrocytic group. Oppositely, the total cholesterol and albumin were relatively low. There were no significant differences observed in terms of gender, smoking, drinking, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, eGFR, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The haemoglobin level and prevalence of diabetes in the microcytic group were slightly different from that in the other two groups, but this difference was negligible.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^35dd4a97]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical examination

In addition to a standard assessment, at‐risk patients should be examined for stigmata of chronic liver disease. In particular, assessment for ascites or asterixis (as a sign of hepatic encephalopathy) should be undertaken as these represent decompensation of cirrhosis which may require specific management. Hypertension is common with alcohol excess, although patients with cirrhosis may have low blood pressure due to hyperdynamic circulation and reduced systemic vascular resistance. It should be noted that findings in liver disease may range from normal to overt decompensation depending on the severity of the disease. When considering regional techniques, it is prudent to document pre‐existing weakness or neurological abnormalities as this may be relevant in the assessment of post‐procedural complications such as nerve injury.

Investigations

A full blood count is useful since anaemia (defined in the peri‐operative setting as haemoglobin < 130 g.l ‐1) from a variety of causes is common in harmful drinking. Although this does not invariably represent a haematinic issue, macrocytic anaemia with a raised mean corpuscular volume may indicate folate/vitamin B12 deficiency or bone marrow toxicity. Iron deficiency may predominate, with reduced ferritin or transferrin/iron saturation levels; however, it should be remembered that ferritin is often artefactually elevated in patients with raised alcohol consumption. Reciprocally, the absence of microcytosis does not mean the patient will not be iron deficient as peripheral erythrocytes may exist in various stages of development. The red cell distribution width may be helpful in these cases as a diagnostic adjunct.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^573be17a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic liver disease (CLD) of any cause is frequently associated with hematological abnormalities. Among these, anemia is a frequent occurrence, seen in about 75% of patients with advanced liver disease. The etiology of anemia, especially in cirrhotic patients, is complex and multifactorial.

The liver performs a major role in iron homeostasis. It is the main organ for the production of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, expressed in iron excess conditions as well as in cases of inflammation, blocking the absorption of iron from the enterocytes. The role of hepcidin in liver diseases, with or without cirrhosis, is still under investigation, but is probably one of the contributing factors to the anemia of chronic disease present in a variety of liver conditions.

Hemolysis also represents a common cause of anemia in patients with liver disease, especially of alcoholic cause, and is usually attributed to spur-cell anemia. It is related to abnormal cholesterol loading of the red blood cell membrane, which results in spiculated erythrocytes with a short lifespan, called acanthocytes.

In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the standard of care until recently, namely treatment with pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, can also cause significant anemia. Interferon treatment has been associated with bone marrow toxicity, while ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia is a well-recognized, dose-dependent side effect of the drug.

Anemia in alcoholic liver disease is also associated with a direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow, causing reversible suppression of hematopoiesis and subsequently anemia with impaired platelet production and function. Moreover, the majority of the patients with chronic alcohol abuse also present with malnutrition, resulting in iron, folate, vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency.

One of the major, and potentially treatable, causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis is acute or chronic blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract, often resulting in iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The hemorrhage is usually secondary to complications of portal hypertension such as gastroesophageal variceal rupture, gastropathy, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) or peptic ulcers, more common in patients with cirrhosis. The fact that patients with liver disease have also had impaired coagulation is a contributing factor to the tendency of bleeding, as well as the thrombocytopenia due to spleen enlargement.

### Conjugated bilirubin triggers anemia by inducing erythrocyte death [^66e14e06]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver failure and fibrosis are commonly associated with anemia, a phenomenon which remains ill-defined due to the heterogeneous nature of anemia's pathogenesis. During liver disease, anemia can occur after blood loss, infection, cancer, or nutritional imbalances. Bleeding through esophageal varices can result in rapid blood loss and consequently anemia in patients with liver failure. Additionally, chronic viral infections can reduce the number of circulating erythrocytes by depletion of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Hepatitis B and C infections and their treatment regimens are similarly associated with reduced erythrocyte counts.–Furthermore, as folate and vitamin B 12 are critical for erythrocyte development, nutritional imbalances may result in reduced erythrocyte production and consequently anemia. Moreover, expression of ferroportin-1 in the liver can impact the development of anemia, as ferroportin-1 is critical for iron metabolism and hematopoiesis during an iron-deficient diet. Although many conditions are associated with anemia, the impact of liver damage on erythrocytes and the associated underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Iron homeostasis and liver disease

Since the liver plays a major role in iron balance, it is obvious that liver diseases of different etiology, and especially advanced CLD with portal hypertension, are directly related to abnormalities in iron homeostasis.

Full blood count

The approach begins with the full blood count (FBC). Hb determination is the most widespread screening method for IDA and the World Health Organization places the lower limit of normal for Hb concentration at 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, below 11 g/dL in pregnant women and 13 g/dL for men. However, FBC has many limitations when used alone, because of its low specificity and sensitivity. For that reason, in the diagnostic workup of anemia, erythrocyte parameters such as MCV, MCH and RDW are measured and evaluated in combination with Hb. For example hypochromia and microcytosis combined with low ferritin makes the diagnosis of IDA fairly easy, but in patients with cirrhosis MCV is increased because of vitamin deficits and membrane deposition of lipoproteins. In a cross-sectional study of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis Intragumtornchai et al found that 48% of patients with ID, proved by bone marrow aspiration, had an MCV greater than 100 fL.

Another parameter of erythrocytes that is often used together with the MCV results is the RDW, which depicts the variation of red blood cell width. Unfortunately, this tool is also not useful in cirrhotic patients, as was shown by a retrospective study of 241 patients with liver cirrhosis and anemia. In this study Milic et al did not manage to prove any clinical value of RDW in the differentiation of anemia, or any statistically significant increase of RDW in relation to the severity of the disease.

Likewise, the thrombocytosis that exists in both IDA and anemia of inflammatory conditions, due to the effect of erythropoietin and interleukin-6 on megakaryocytes, is not seen in patients with CLD and portal hypertension because of spleen sequestration.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^a9cf8c88]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial, mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular volume are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with oral or parenteral iron as well as portal pressure reducing drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia despite iron supplementation.

Concluding remarks

Iron homeostasis is the result of a complex mechanism and may be significantly disturbed in patients with CLD of different etiology and variable stages. ID is often documented, especially in advanced liver disease with portal hypertension, and is usually due to chronic blood loss. However, the concomitant presence of inflammation significantly influences the iron markers, making the diagnosis of ID difficult. The role of iron homeostasis proteins in the pathophysiology of CLD or as markers of prognosis is still controversial and has to be demonstrated in future research.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^7b1ac934]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Coagulation in cirrhosis — nonhepatic modifiers of bleeding and clotting include anemia severity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) changes, AICF, renal failure, and alcohol. When bleeding causes anemia, once the hematocrit drops below approximately 25%, the erythrocyte concentration is insufficient to push platelets toward vessel walls, which impairs coagulation. In cirrhosis, The vWF amount and length are increased and vWF levels may further increase as lipopolysaccharide blood concentration increases. During decompensation, patients may develop AICF; high factor VIII levels help distinguish AICF from disseminated intravascular coagulation, and AICF is best characterized as a form of hyperfibrinolysis with premature clot dissolution and clinically evident mucosal oozing and puncture wound bleeding. Patients with renal failure have unique impairments to platelet function with reduced serotonin in their α-granules, disrupted intracellular calcium flux, and dysregulated formation of thromboxane A2, leading to decreased adhesive and aggregative properties. Alcohol intoxication can affect coagulation with bidirectional effects, as alcohol can impair platelet production and initial clot formation but can also decrease fibrinolysis.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Haemochromatosis [^90011823]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Haemochromatosis is now known to be an iron-storage disease with genetic heterogeneity but with a final common metabolic pathway resulting in inappropriately low production of the hormone hepcidin. This leads to increase in intestinal absorption and deposition of excessive amounts of iron in parenchymal cells which in turn results in eventual tissue damage and organ failure. A clinical enigma has been the variable clinical expression with some patients presenting with hepatic cirrhosis at a young age and others almost asymptomatic for life. Research is unravelling this puzzle by identifying environmental factors-especially alcohol consumption-and associated modifying genes that modulate phenotypic expression. A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis but this can lead to presymptomatic therapy and a normal life expectancy. Venesection (phlebotomy) therapy remains the mainstay of therapy, but alternative therapies are the subject of current research.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^198ebc16]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

Case Report

A 39‐year‐old white man was referred for a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. His mother had anemia and cirrhosis and died of colon cancer at age 43, and his sister had an unclear blood dyscrasia and died at age 40. The patient had gray hair, but an otherwise unremarkable physical examination.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT; Fig. 1A, B) identified ascites, splenomegaly, and a small, nodular liver suspicious for cirrhosis. His liver volume (Fig. 1C) was 1,148 cm 3, which was 51% of expected (2,229 cm 3) based on height (1.88 m) and weight (109.3 kg). Hemodynamic analysis showed a hepatic venous pressure gradient of 13 mm Hg, consistent with portal hypertension. He had normal liver function tests and negative hepatitis serologies. Liver biopsy revealed LCC of 40%‐50% of hepatocytes (Fig. 2A, B). Ten percent of hepatocytes were binucleated, and occasional cells contained more than two nuclei (Fig. 2C). Only minimal‐to‐focal mild portal mononuclear inflammation was observed. Trichrome staining (Fig. 2D) revealed mild portal and periportal fibrosis without nodularity or cirrhosis.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^9091917f]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic disorders causing altered RBC hydration and hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA) with macrocytosis include PIEZO1 ‐ or KCNN4 ‐associated hereditary xerocytosis (HX), and RHAG ‐associated overhydrated stomatocytosis (OHSt). Increased reticulocyte count and characteristic osmotic gradient ektacytometry (OGE) curves point toward these diagnostic possibilities. OGE is a diagnostic assay measuring the deformability of RBCs as they are subjected to constant shear stress in a medium of increasing osmolality in a laser diffraction viscometer, allowing for differential diagnosis between the various RBC membrane disorders. Macrocytic stomatocytes and macrothrombocytopenia associated with increased phytosterol content in the membrane lipid bilayer are seen in the autosomal‐recessive disorder of sitosterolemia. Increased cholesterol and phospholipids in the RBC membrane contribute to the macrocytic anemia associated with chronic alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. Other causes of macrocytic anemia, not completely understood in their pathophysiology, include hypothyroidism and trisomy 21.

Folate-deficiency anaemia occurs in about 4 per 100 000 people, although severe cases causing moderate pancytopenia are rarer. We present the case of a significant folate deficiency in a 50-year-old alcoholic with a background of mild liver impairment and recurrent nasal and rectal bleeding. Her blood tests showed profound macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin 2.6 g/dl, leucopoenia with white cell count 3.2 × 10⁹/litre and thrombocytopenia with platelets 17 × 10⁹/litre. Serum folate was 0.8 ng/ml (normal 2.5–13.5 ng/ml) confirming severe deficiency. Despite these life-threatening results, the patient was stable, alert and was keen to avoid admission. Medical management of the anaemia included slow transfusion of red cells and one unit of platelets in view of haemorrhagic symptoms, two injections of vitamin B12 while awaiting assays and oral folic acid. A rapid improvement in the leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia resulted and no additional complications were encountered.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^195e6fb7]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

AMA Arch Intern Med. 1955; 95: 93–102. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1955.00250070109013 IT HAS been known for many years that anemia is frequently present in chronic liver disease, especially in cirrhosis of the liver. The etiology, however, has been obscure and has been the subject of considerable discussion. Since the anemia is often macrocytic in type, as first noted by Gram, in 1883, 1 and subsequently confirmed by others, * it was only natural that a deficiency in the anti-pernicious-anemia factor be suspected. This explanation, however, has been largely discredited because of the lack of response to liver extract † and because the bone marrow is rarely megaloblastic in character.

‡ In addition, it has been shown by Schiff and coworkers 15 that extracts made from cirrhotic livers are able to produce a hematological remission in patients with pernicious anemia.

### Mutations in thegene cause autosomal recessive congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III [^4ddeac39]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type III (CDA III) is one of the rarest types of CDA. The autosomal dominant form of CDA III, is due to mono-allelic mutations in the KIF23 gene (MIM:105600); two such mutations described so far in a total of three families. KIF23 encodes mitotic kinesin-like protein (MKLP1), which dimerizes and combines with a homodimer of the RACGAP1 protein (Rac GTPase-activating protein 1), to form the centralspindlin complex regulating Rho GTPase activity and required for cytokinesis. Sporadic cases with CDA III pathology have been reported, suggesting a different genetic alteration. All reported CDA III cases present with a core phenotype consisting of variable degree of macrocytic anemia, signs of intravascular hemolysis, and giant multinucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow. Additional symptoms such as multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy, angioid streaks, hemosiderinuria, hepatosplenomegaly, iron overload or cirrhosis were described in some CDA III patients. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) in combination with ex vivo erythroid differentiation we identified two pathogenic missense mutations in the RACGAP1 gene in three unrelated families affected with the recessive form of CDA III.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^044c32cb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) with iron deficiency anemia — diagnosis and management are summarized as follows: The diagnosis of PHG requires endoscopic visualization. Management of IDA in patients with PHG starts with addressing the underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, in particular with interventions to reduce portal pressure; nonselective β-blockers reduce portal pressure and several clinical studies have suggested that patients with nonbleeding and bleeding PHG treated with propranolol had better outcomes than placebo. The most effective approaches to reducing portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts and liver transplantation, and endoscopic therapy rarely is helpful because bleeding typically is from diffuse mucosal lesions. Beyond portal hypertension management, all patients with IDA and PHG should receive iron therapy, which may be oral or IV, with oral iron usually sufficient due to no known malabsorptive defect; there is no contraindication to IV iron and it may increase the speed with which iron stores are repleted depending on severity and tolerance.

Table 1
WHO classification of anaemia according to age and severity.

Table 2
Classification of anaemia.

Hypo‐regenerative anaemia can occur in aplastic anaemia, renal cell aplasia, renal failure or endocrine disorders. A disturbance in the maturation and proliferation of red blood cells (RBCs) may be caused by defective DNA synthesis, as in anaemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. In IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, there is impaired Hb synthesis. ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection, inflammation or malignancy. To understand the pathomechanism of anaemia, assessment of hepcidin levels may be very helpful. Hepcidin is an iron‐regulatory hormone that inhibits iron release from cells of the reticuloendothelial system and intestinal absorption leading to hypoferraemia. An increase in hepcidin and other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, reduces the availability of iron for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. It is usually a mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia and with low circulating iron and low transferrin saturation, but with a normal to elevated iron storage protein ferritin.

Background

A 56-year-old male with a history of excess alcohol consumption for over 10 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 14 years previously) presented to the accident and emergency department with severe anemia and a 1-day history of nausea and 'coffee ground' vomiting. He had been admitted to hospital on several occasions in the previous 18 months, primarily because of anemia, and had received 30 units of transfused blood during this period. Previous extensive investigations included six esophagogastroduodenoscopies and a colonoscopy, a barium follow-through study, and a radionucleotide Meckel's scan. The prior working diagnosis was anemia secondary to blood loss.

Investigations

Laboratory investigations (full blood count [including reticulocytes], microscopic blood film examination, hematinics, liver function tests with direct and indirect bilirubin measurement, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase level), transjugular liver biopsy and bone-marrow biopsy.

Diagnosis

Alcohol-related anemia caused by acute hemolysis, sideroblastic anemia and cirrhosis.

Management

Correction of anemia by blood transfusion (6 units), and prevention of recurrence by strict abstinence from alcohol.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^22e1aea6]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

Certainty of the evidence and clinical implications — The certainty of evidence was very low across all outcomes due to indirectness and few events. Data suggest baseline bleeding risk for common nonsurgical procedures is low in cirrhosis, and there are insufficient data to justify cutoffs of standard coagulation parameters. The technical review stratified procedure-related bleeding risk into low or high using a threshold of 1.5%. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing high-risk procedures, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include potential benefits and risks, the threshold for severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy could not be clearly defined and remains a matter of clinical judgment, and in many cases care should be managed in collaboration with an expert hematologist.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^c519434e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Serum ferritin levels according to different patient characteristics. Ferritin levels were higher in male (a) and older (b) compared to female or younger patients. According to patients' severity, Child–Pugh C stadium was associated with increased ferritin levels only compared to Child–Pugh A stadium (c). There was no difference between groups by the presence of ascites (d), hepatocellular carcinoma ([HCC] e) or alcoholic etiology (f). Patients with a history of variceal bleeding (VB) had significantly lower serum ferritin levels (G), while there was no difference detected between patients with or without anemia (h) determined by low hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels

Importantly, ferritin levels were significantly lower in patients who had a prior variceal bleeding episode compared to those who did not have such an event (median [IQR]: 43.1 [19.8–125.6] vs. 146.6 [52.7–358.3] μg/L, p < 0.001, Fig. 2 g). However, when we divided our patients according to the presence or absence of anemia as described in the Methods section, we did not find significant differences between the two groups (median [IQR]: 92.5 [31.2–301.4] vs. 132.4 [43.8–320.0] μg/L, respectively; p = 0.144, Fig. 2 h).

Next, we investigated the association between serum ferritin level and other laboratory parameters (i.e. continuous variables). While ferritin levels correlated with markers of hematopoiesis and iron homeostasis in both compensated and decompensated patients, the indicators of inflammation (CRP and white blood cell counts) showed correlation with ferritin levels only in patients with previous decompensation. Similarly, disease severity measures (Child–Pugh score and MELD) correlated with ferritin only in the decompensated group. Non-parametric correlations are summarized in Table 2.

### Anemia in children [^958fac0e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^30d47e7e]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^bd6698b0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large cohort of cirrhotic outpatients, we measured serum ferritin levels and evaluated its association with the development of disease-specific complications and mortality during a 2-year-long follow-up period. We found that ferritin's serum concentration was significantly higher in males and older patients, as it was previously reported. We also observed significantly lower levels in patients, who previously had variceal bleeding while anemia was not associated with such difference in these patients. However, when we investigated correlations of ferritin with other laboratory measures, we found that parameters associated with hematopoiesis and iron homeostasis (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume) correlated with ferritin in both compensated and decompensated groups, while inflammation markers and disease severity measures did only in the latter group. This result indicates that although in advanced stages of cirrhosis, inflammation and disease severity are important modulators of ferritin level, in earlier stages, ferritin concentration mainly corresponds to the iron homeostasis of the body, much like in the healthy population. Previous studies reported that cirrhosis induced immune-dysfunction predominantly manifests in decompensated stage resulting in systemic inflammatory and compensatory anti-inflammatory responses. This observation is in line with the lack of correlation between ferritin level and inflammatory measures in our compensated outpatients.

### Runner's anemia [^d098ef44]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Macrocytic anemia occurring in patients with fatigue suggests numerous diagnoses, ranging from nutritional deficiencies to a myelodysplastic syndrome. A careful history-taking is critically important for recognition of runner's anemia, which is due to plasma volume expansion, with hemolysis from the pounding of feet on pavement, and hemoglobinuria. Gastrointestinal blood loss may also contribute to anemia in long-distance runners. Early recognition of runner's anemia in patients with a complex presentation of anemia is important in circumventing many diagnostic tests. Runner's anemia should be considered when, amidst a constellation of signs and symptoms, mild anemia is well tolerated by an avid runner.

Liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite this, the natural history of liver disease is not well characterized and the evidence basis for specific therapeutic intervention is not robust. The spectrum of clinical liver disease encountered includes asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function; acute deteriorations in liver function, sometimes with a dramatic clinical phenotype; and decompensated chronic liver disease. In this paper, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of patients with acute and chronic liver disease will be outlined. Advice will be given regarding initial assessment and investigation. The evidence for specific medical and surgical interventions will be reviewed, and management recommendations made for each specific clinical presentation. The potential role for liver transplantation will be considered in detail.

### Utility and limitations of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with liver cirrhosis as compared with oral glucose tolerance test for diagnosis of diabetes [^a943c9fe]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of anemia was 90% in our study population. The presence of moderate to severe degree of anemia affected the performance of HbA1c in our study as described in " Results ". In a recent systematic review, English et al. found that HbA1c is likely to be affected by iron deficiency anemia (IDA), possibly resulting in a spurious increase in HbA1c values and that non-IDA may lead to decreased HbA1c values. Overall only two studies (both in non-CLD subjects) were identified in their systematic review which analyzed the prevalence of diabetes by OGTT-based criteria and HbA1c-based criteria taking anemia into account. The current study therefore adds significantly to the knowledge gap in this area. In a study was from India, Hardikar et al. investigated a population of young Indian subjects, among whom 30.8% had vitamin B12 deficiency, 15% had folate deficiency and 30% had multiple nutrient deficiencies. In the multivariate analysis, B12 and folate were not significantly related to HbA1c levels. The authors postulated that where mixed nutrient deficiencies are observed, the combination of pathologies will lead to variable and unpredictable effects on HbA1c levels depending on the relative degree of each nutrient deficiency.

The prevalence of diabetes was 35.4 and 34.3% in outpatients and inpatients, respectively, indicating that hospitalized patients with CLD can undergo OGTT when they are stable and ready for discharge. Stress hyperglycemia may not significantly alter the results in such patients.

The prevalence of moderate to severe anemia was 53.8% in the subjects from the OPD and 63.6% in the hospitalized patients. This may be one of the reasons underlying the better performance of HbA1c in OPD subjects, as discussed in the " Results ". We did not find any significant differences between different degrees of severity of liver disease.

Our study has its strengths and limitations. The major strength of the study is that it adds new information in multiple domains. The evaluation of HbA1c as compared to OGTT taking into account the degree of anemia has been evaluated for the first time. Since there are specific advantages to HbA1c testing, this study adds vital piece of information on its utility in patients with cirrhosis. One of the major limitations of our study is that is was a single-center study with a sample size of 100 patients. Due to this small sample size, the effect of different etiologies of cirrhosis and different etiologies of anemia could not be evaluated. The effect of gender and the effect of different complications also could not be evaluated. The results need to be substantiated in a larger study.

### Idiopathic portal hypertension [^714caf1d]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a rare disorder characterized by clinical portal hypertension in the absence of a recognizable cause such as cirrhosis. Laboratory tests often reveal a preserved liver function with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia due to splenomegaly. Imaging studies reveal signs of portal hypertension, whereas liver stiffness and portal pressure values are usually normal or slightly elevated. Liver biopsy is considered mandatory in order to rule out other causes of portal hypertension, mainly cirrhosis. Liver histology may only show subtle or mild changes, and the definite diagnosis of IPH often requires an expert pathologist and a high-quality specimen. The most frequent clinical presentation is variceal bleeding. Ascites is rarely observed initially, although it may occasionally appear during follow-up. Typical histological findings associated with IPH have been described in patients without portal hypertension, probably representing early stages of the disease. Although the pathophysiology of this entity remains largely unknown, it is frequently associated with underlying immunological disorders, bacterial infections, trace metal poisoning, medications, liver circulatory disturbances, and thrombotic events. The long-term prognosis of patients with IPH, where ascites and the underlying condition are important prognostic factors, is better than in patients with cirrhosis. Treatments that modify the natural history of the disease remain an unmet need, and management of IPH is frequently restricted to control of portal hypertension-related complications.

### Study details | Etiopathogenesis of anemia in chronic liver disease… [^da5c8923]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr virus. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multi factorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and increased intestinal permeability, and gut dysbiosis.

Patients with cirrhosis patients have a high incidence of sepsis which can trigger decompensation and may result in prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Many studies have estimated that about 30%-50% admissions of patients with cirrhosis have sepsis. Of those who don't have sepsis at presentation, about 15% patients admitted to hospital develop sepsis during the hospital stay. After infection develops, the patient may develop acute kidney injury, shock, encephalopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation further decreasing the chances of survival. Sepsis and the associated cytokines have a myelosuppressive effect and prevent the erythron from making blood cells. This results in an increase in ferritin as an inflammatory biomarker and alters iron metabolism by affecting the production of hepcidin in the liver.

In the study, after taking informed consent, participants will be evaluated for etiology of chronic liver disease with proper history, clinical examination and investigations which will include viral markers, serum ceruloplasmin, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease work up and radiological investigations for cirrhosis. The severity of cirrhosis will be determined by Child-Pugh's and MELD/MELD-Na score.

### Positive predictive value highlights four novel candidates for actionable genetic screening from analysis of 220, 000 clinicogenomic records [^42debf51]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

HBB and hemoglobinopathies

Rare variants in HBB cause the recessive hemoglobinopathy β-thalassemia major, which is quite severe and presents early in life. The statistically significant, dominant association between HBB rare variants and hemoglobinopathies and the high PPV (0.55, Table 3) found in our cohorts are driven by a mixture of some individuals who may have β-thalassemia intermedia, a less severe form of the disease that is sometimes inherited in a dominant fashion, and many individuals with β-thalassemia minor, who are generally asymptomatic but often have mild anemia.

Individuals with β-thalassemia minor are often misdiagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia. In our study, 30% of HBB LoF heterozygotes with a thalassemia diagnosis and 16% of heterozygotes without a thalassemia diagnosis had a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, driving a statistically significant association with this trait (Table S1; compared to only 6% of those without a HBB LoF variant). Furthermore, 12% of HBB LoF heterozygotes reported taking iron supplements, compared to 3% of those without HBB LoF variants. Medical records indicated hemochromatosis in 1.6% of HBB LoF heterozygotes vs. 0.4% of those without HBB LoF variants, 2.4% vs. 0.007% had hepatic fibrosis, and 2.2% vs. 0.3% had nonalcoholic cirrhosis, indicating that complications of iron overload can be a concern for HBB LoF heterozygotes. Additionally, the bloodwork available for members of these cohorts showed that 100% of the HBB LoF heterozygotes, regardless of thalassemia diagnosis status, had red blood cell (RBC) microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 μm; compared to 6% of those without LoF variants), indicating that many individuals with β-thalassemia minor may remain undiagnosed in these cohorts. For individuals with β-thalassemia intermedia, common complications include extensive iron overload in many tissues through increased intestinal absorption, as well as marked and progressive osteoporosis. Not only can the diagnosis of thalassemia be directly confirmed via blood tests, but many screenings and treatments also exist to avoid or mitigate the phenotypic complications, including bone density scans, blood tests to assess iron overload, blood transfusions, splenectomy, folic acid supplementation, and iron chelation therapies. Early detection of HBB LoF heterozygotes is useful for reproductive planning and for helping physicians tailor treatment when considering the cause of the patient's anemia. In our study, only 29% of cases with HBB LoF variants with age of diagnosis available had been diagnosed as children, indicating that genetic screening of adults for this condition may be warranted.

Postoperative risk in cirrhosis — pathophysiological contributors include portal hypertension with portosystemic collaterals that increases the risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding; ascites leading to infection, impaired wound healing, and leakage from surgical incisions; hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and disruptions in secondary hemostasis that can result in either bleeding or thrombosis; renal and metabolic derangements including electrolyte abnormalities and a predisposition to acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome; and immunological dysfunction that increases susceptibility to wound infections and sepsis.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^58cfbe93]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^07dec496]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90·4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

Micronutrients in cirrhosis — vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common and particularly prevalent in advanced disease, cholestasis, or acute illness; routine assessment and repletion are recommended, with guidance stating micronutrient deficiencies should be assessed at least annually, repleted if deficient, and reassessed after repletion; because status may not be regularly assessed and multivitamins are inexpensive and essentially free of side effects, the authors support a pragmatic empiric course of oral multivitamin supplementation in patients with evidence of frailty or sarcopenia.

Secondary iron overload in nontransfusion-dependent iron-loading anemias — because serum ferritin (SF) may underestimate hepatic iron concentration (HIC), an SF threshold of > 800 ng/mL should lead to initiation of treatment in these patients; both phlebotomy and chelation may have a therapeutic role, though chelation is the preferred treatment due to concerns regarding exacerbation of the underlying anemia.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^96cac17d]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — guidance statements 48–51 outline management: Patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and should therefore be considered for prophylactic nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) to prevent decompensation; this intervention may also prevent hemorrhagic complications or iron-deficiency anemia from severe PHG. In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^89912ded]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Macrocytic anemia in disease of the liver… [^83ae73e5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The cause of the so-called pernicious blood picture is still one of the most interesting fields of study in modern medicine. It is now generally recognized that this type of anemia is merely one variety of faulty formation of blood and not a pathognomonic sign. Whatever disease process is able to bring about this particular disturbance in hematopoiesis may produce this blood picture. The following introductory case first suggested to me that cirrhosis of the liver might be another such disease process. This case was presented at a medical clinic in the John Hopkins Hospital on March 8, 1931. 1 A man, aged 50, showed a clinical picture of advanced hepatic cirrhosis together with signs strongly suggestive of pernicious anemia. The liver was markedly enlarged and nodular. The skin was moderately jaundiced. There were in addition glossitis, combined sclerosis and a macrocytic type of anemia. The hemoglobin. VAN DUYN J.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) related anemia — evaluation and initial workup: Standard assessments should be performed to look for other causes of anemia, including GI bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and corrected if depleted, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproliferative macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels. Bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^2aa98deb]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ring sideroblasts were not identified in PIII‐A, who had bone marrow studies at 18 years old, though it may have been too early; in contrast, RS have been noted in older patients with ALAS2 ‐CDA and more significant iron overload. Genetic causes for macrocytic anemia caused by CDA or inherited BMFS are less common than acquired nutritional deficiencies or those secondary to medications. Moreover, acquired MDS with clonal hematopoiesis is more likely in middle‐age or older adults like P‐II and P‐I, who would have been in risk of misdiagnosis with MDS with or without ringed sideroblasts if they had been evaluated before P‐IIIA. Iron overload is a common comorbidity in macrocytic anemias with stress and especially ineffective, erythropoiesis such as CDAs and MDS, even without concurrent transfusions, since increased erythroferrone suppresses hepcidin. Therefore, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin, and iron saturation monitoring are necessary, preferably with further evaluation of tissue iron with appropriate imaging (MRI T2✱), if ferritin is persistently > 400 ng/mL, in order to proceed to appropriate treatment.

After nutritional deficiencies and HHAs with reticulocytosis have been ruled out in macrocytic anemias, it is reasonable to proceed to bone marrow studies, since BMFS may underlie macrocytosis. Yet even marrow studies may not be adequate, either because CDA‐associated dyserythropoiesis may be subtle or because it may be falsely interpreted as acquired MDS. This case of CDA highlights the value of genetic evaluation alongside marrow studies in similar macrocytic anemias and reflects the evolving landscape of understanding ALAS2 pathophysiology that had previously been primarily attributed to XLSA.
