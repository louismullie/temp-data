## Question

Vyvanse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the FDA-approved indications and key limitations. Next, I will review efficacy data for ADHD across ages, followed by efficacy for binge-eating disorder and maintenance of effect. After that, I need to examine safety, boxed warnings, and contraindications. I will then consider special populations, dosing, and administration. Finally, I should appraise off-label evidence and synthesize a practical, risk–benefit conclusion with monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism. Vyvanse is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine, requiring enzymatic conversion to active d-amphetamine, which then increases synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine via reuptake inhibition and release, with low inter- and intra-subject variability and no accumulation at steady state, supporting predictable once-daily pharmacokinetics [^f8e0e05b] [^25d242aa].

> I need to verify the labeled indications and limitations. The FDA approves Vyvanse for ADHD in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older, and for moderate-to-severe binge-eating disorder in adults. It is not approved for weight loss or obesity, and use in children under 6 years is not recommended due to greater long-term weight loss and higher exposure to dextroamphetamine at the same dose, so I should be explicit about avoiding off-label weight-loss use and pediatric use under 6 years [^a18fda74] [^71506313] [^d2966c93].

> Next, I should review ADHD efficacy in children. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 290 children aged 6–12 years, 30, 50, and 70 mg Vyvanse were all superior to placebo on the ADHD Rating Scale, with onset within 1 week and durable effects through the day per parent ratings; a separate pediatric study confirmed efficacy and tolerability with similar onset and duration, reinforcing once-daily utility in school-aged children [^05536a6a] [^07ad4c8c].

> Hold on, I should verify adolescent data. In a 4-week RCT of 314 adolescents aged 13–17 years, Vyvanse 30, 50, and 70 mg all significantly improved ADHD-RS versus placebo, with CGI-I response rates around 69% on active treatment versus 39.5% on placebo, indicating clinically meaningful benefit in this age group as well [^e1e9f6d2] [^fbed8873].

> I will now examine adult ADHD efficacy. In a 4-week RCT of 420 adults, Vyvanse 30, 50, and 70 mg produced significant ADHD-RS improvements versus placebo, with effects evident by Week 1; a crossover workplace-simulation study showed sustained attention benefits across 14 hours, supporting all-day coverage in occupational settings [^96a4f544] [^3c73ead2].

> Let me consider maintenance of ADHD benefit. A randomized-withdrawal study in adults showed that only 8.9% on Vyvanse relapsed versus 75.0% on placebo over 6 weeks, with most relapses within 1–2 weeks of withdrawal; a pediatric randomized-withdrawal study similarly demonstrated maintenance of efficacy with rapid symptom return on placebo, underscoring the need for ongoing treatment in responders [^33247fbf] [^b950d054].

> Now, I should review binge-eating disorder efficacy. Two 12-week, dose-optimized, Phase 3 trials showed Vyvanse 50–70 mg reduced binge-eating days per week versus placebo, with early separation by Week 1 and clinically meaningful improvements in global functioning and weight; a randomized-withdrawal maintenance study demonstrated markedly lower relapse on Vyvanse (3.7%) versus placebo (32.1%) over 26 weeks, establishing durability of effect in adults with BED [^b4ed842a] [^03c29133] [^5c57078a].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response nuance. A Phase 2 fixed-dose study found 50 and 70 mg were superior to placebo, but 30 mg was not, which aligns with the labeled target dose range of 50–70 mg for BED; this helps explain why titration from 30 mg to 50–70 mg is standard practice in BED [^b4ed842a] [^a91c8cc6].

> I need to ensure I cover safety comprehensively. Vyvanse carries a boxed warning for abuse, misuse, and addiction; assess risk before prescribing, educate patients, store securely, and monitor throughout treatment. Common adverse effects include decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, headache, irritability, weight loss, and dose-related increases in blood pressure and heart rate; monitor vitals at baseline and periodically, and avoid use in patients with serious cardiac disease or structural cardiac abnormalities [^63ec6f84] [^98998027] [^215c51de] [^8b5d30d2].

> Hold on, I should verify growth effects in pediatrics. In children with ADHD, Vyvanse is associated with dose-related weight loss and slowing of growth rate; over 12 months, consistently medicated children showed an average decrease of about 13.4 percentile points in weight and approximately 2 cm less height growth over 3 years, so monitor growth and consider drug holidays or dose reduction if growth falters [^cc31eb38] [^4ef07f29].

> I should confirm psychiatric risks. Stimulants can exacerbate psychosis, induce mania, and worsen tics or Tourette's; screen for personal and family history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, and tics before initiation, and discontinue if new psychotic or manic symptoms emerge. Serotonin syndrome is a theoretical risk with serotonergic combinations, though rare, so use caution with SSRIs/SNRIs and counsel promptly on emergent symptoms [^2540305d] [^9e1145b0].

> Let me think about peripheral vasculopathy. Postmarketing reports link stimulants, including Vyvanse, to Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischemia; observe for digital changes, especially in cold exposure, and reduce dose or stop if significant vasoconstriction occurs [^0ef7eeb0].

> Next, I should review contraindications and key drug interactions. Vyvanse is contraindicated with MAOIs or within 14 days of MAOI use due to hypertensive crisis risk, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to amphetamine products; it is also contraindicated in those with serious cardiac disease, cardiomyopathy, serious arrhythmias, or coronary artery disease, so screen carefully and avoid in these conditions [^51c0168c] [^fe37cd2e].

> I will now examine special populations. In pregnancy, avoid Vyvanse when possible due to risks of vasoconstriction, reduced placental perfusion, preterm delivery, and low birth weight; enroll patients in the National Pregnancy Registry if exposure occurs. In lactation, amphetamine is present in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment. In renal impairment, reduce maximum dose to 50 mg if eGFR 15–30 mL/min and to 30 mg if eGFR < 15 mL/min; no adjustment is needed for hepatic impairment [^6171343b] [^d2966c93] [^1f717c61] [^7cfea6aa] [^17572d52].

> Let me verify dosing and administration. For ADHD, start 30 mg once daily in the morning and titrate by 10–20 mg weekly to a maximum of 70 mg; for BED, start 30 mg and titrate by 20 mg weekly to 50–70 mg, discontinuing if binge eating does not improve. Capsules can be swallowed whole or opened and mixed with yogurt, water, or orange juice; chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly. Avoid afternoon dosing to limit insomnia [^8c14ddac] [^a91c8cc6] [^c45e8789].

> But wait, what about off-label uses. Large, well-controlled Phase 3 trials of Vyvanse augmentation for major depressive disorder failed to show benefit versus placebo, so it should not be used for MDD augmentation outside of research settings. Small studies suggest possible improvements in executive dysfunction in ADHD and chronic fatigue, and a Phase II MS study showed improved processing speed and memory, but these remain preliminary and are not indications; similarly, trials in methamphetamine use disorder show only modest, transient reductions in use and are not practice-changing at this time [^2c7aaa26] [^3e317bd0] [^a5ca9ed9] [^e772f212] [^0bb92b0f] [^ac66566a].

> I should double-check abuse liability. Human abuse-liability studies show lower "drug liking" with oral Vyvanse compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine at equivalent amphetamine exposure, and intravenous Vyvanse produces less abuse-related subjective effects than IV d-amphetamine; nonetheless, as a Schedule II stimulant, it retains meaningful abuse potential, so risk assessment and monitoring are essential [^cb98cc6c] [^26249fb7] [^9fa86df4].

> Let me synthesize the clinical positioning. Vyvanse is a first-line pharmacotherapy for ADHD in patients aged 6 years and older, with robust, rapid, and durable efficacy across pediatric, adolescent, and adult populations, and it is the only FDA-approved medication for moderate-to-severe BED in adults, with strong short- and long-term efficacy signals. Benefits must be balanced against risks of abuse, cardiovascular effects, growth suppression in children, and psychiatric adverse effects, with careful screening, dosing, and monitoring to optimize outcomes [^a18fda74] [^71506313].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical monitoring is explicit. Before starting, obtain cardiac history and exam, family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmias, baseline blood pressure and heart rate, height and weight in children, and a pregnancy test when relevant; during treatment, reassess abuse risk, monitor vitals periodically, track growth in pediatrics, and watch for emergent psychiatric symptoms or digital vasculopathy; counsel on safe storage and disposal, and consider periodic drug holidays in children with growth concerns or dose minimization strategies to mitigate long-term adverse effects [^8c14ddac] [^98998027] [^2540305d] [^0ef7eeb0] [^cc31eb38].

Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is a **once-daily, long-acting stimulant** approved for ADHD in patients ≥ 6 years and for moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder in adults [^a18fda74]. It is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine with **lower abuse potential** than immediate-release amphetamines, but still carries a boxed warning for abuse and dependence [^63ec6f84] [^cb98cc6c]. Common adverse effects include decreased appetite, insomnia, and dry mouth; serious risks include cardiovascular events, psychiatric effects, and growth suppression in children, so monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and growth during treatment [^215c51de] [^2540305d] [^cc31eb38]. Start at 30 mg once daily and titrate to 50–70 mg for BED or up to 70 mg for ADHD as tolerated; avoid use with MAOIs or in patients with significant cardiovascular disease [^8c14ddac] [^fe37cd2e].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Prodrug of dextroamphetamine; increases synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine via reuptake inhibition and release, enhancing attention and impulse control [^f8e0e05b] [^25d242aa].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Oral absorption with peak dextroamphetamine levels at ~3.5 hours; half-life ~12 hours, supporting once-daily dosing; food delays peak by ~1 hour but does not affect overall exposure [^186d8170] [^25d242aa].

- **Abuse potential**: Lower than immediate-release amphetamines due to prodrug design and slower onset, but still Schedule II with boxed warning [^63ec6f84] [^cb98cc6c].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

| **Indication** | **Age group** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|
| ADHD | ≥ 6 years | - Robust efficacy in randomized trials <br/> - Rapid onset within 1 week <br/> - Dose-dependent improvements in attention and impulse control [^05536a6a] [^96a4f544] [^3c73ead2] |
| Binge eating disorder | Adults ≥ 18 years | - Reduces binge-eating days and episodes <br/> - Weight loss of ~3–5 kg over 12 weeks <br/> - Maintenance of efficacy shown in withdrawal studies [^b4ed842a] [^ce7c387c] [^5c57078a] |

---

## Dosage and administration

- **ADHD**: Start 30 mg once daily in the morning; titrate by 10–20 mg weekly to a maximum of 70 mg [^8c14ddac].

- **BED**: Start 30 mg once daily; titrate by 20 mg weekly to 50–70 mg; discontinue if no improvement [^8c14ddac] [^a91c8cc6].

- **Administration**: Capsules can be swallowed whole or opened and mixed with yogurt, water, or juice; chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly [^8c14ddac] [^c45e8789].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, headache, irritability, weight loss, anxiety, nausea, and gastrointestinal upset [^215c51de] [^d7568779].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Cardiovascular events (hypertension, tachycardia, sudden death in patients with structural heart disease), psychiatric effects (psychosis, mania, aggression), growth suppression in children, and peripheral vasculopathy (Raynaud's phenomenon) [^98998027] [^2540305d] [^0ef7eeb0].

- **Dependence and withdrawal**: Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (dysphoria, fatigue, vivid dreams, increased appetite) can occur with prolonged use or abrupt discontinuation [^cb98cc6c].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to amphetamines, **MAOI use** (or within 14 days), significant cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or a history of drug abuse [^51c0168c] [^fe37cd2e]. Use caution in patients with psychiatric disorders, tics, or Tourette's; monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and growth in children during treatment [^8c14ddac] [^2540305d].

---

## Comparison with other ADHD medications

Compared with immediate-release stimulants, Vyvanse has a **smoother, longer duration of effect** and lower abuse potential, though it is still Schedule II [^cb98cc6c]. Versus methylphenidate, efficacy is broadly similar, but individual response varies; Vyvanse may cause less appetite suppression and insomnia in some patients.

---

## Patient counseling and monitoring

- **Counseling**: Educate on adherence, storage, and risks of misuse; reinforce that Vyvanse is not for weight loss [^a18fda74].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess cardiovascular status, growth, psychiatric symptoms, and signs of misuse or dependence [^8c14ddac] [^98998027].

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Use only if benefits outweigh risks; dextroamphetamine crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk [^6171343b] [^d2966c93].

---

Vyvanse is effective for ADHD and BED with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, but requires careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring due to abuse potential and cardiovascular and psychiatric risks [^a18fda74] [^63ec6f84].

Pediatric Patients Ages 13 to 17 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 4) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years (N = 314) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a daily morning dose of VYVANSE (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day or 70 mg/day) or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 4 in Table 6).

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 17 Years: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled parallel-group, dose-optimization study (Study 5) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (n = 336) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this eight-week study, patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of VYVANSE (30, 50 or 70 mg/day), an active control, or placebo (1:1:1). The study consisted of a Screening and Washout Period (up to 42 days), a 7-week Double-blind Evaluation Period (consisting of a 4-week Dose-Optimization Period followed by a 3-week Dose-Maintenance Period), and a 1-week Washout and Follow-up Period. During the Dose Optimization Period, subjects were titrated until an optimal dose, based on tolerability and investigator's judgment, was reached. VYVANSE showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean reduction from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score was 18.6. Subjects on VYVANSE also showed greater improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) rating scale compared to subjects on placebo (Study 5 in Table 6).

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 12 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N = 290) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type). Patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of VYVANSE or placebo once daily in the morning for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), an 18-item questionnaire with a score range of 0–54 points that measures the core symptoms of ADHD which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome. Mean effects at all doses were similar; however, the highest dose (70 mg/day) was numerically superior to both lower doses (Study 1 in Table 6). The effects were maintained throughout the day based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale) in the morning (approximately 10 am), afternoon (approximately 2 pm), and early evening (approximately 6 pm).

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) [^3b33a39b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Both 12-week studies consisted of a 4-week dose-optimization period and an 8-week dose-maintenance period. During dose-optimization, subjects assigned to VYVANSE began treatment at the titration dose of 30 mg/day and, after 1 week of treatment, were subsequently titrated to 50 mg/day. Additional increases to 70 mg/day were made as tolerated and clinically indicated. Following the dose-optimization period, subjects continued on their optimized dose for the duration of the dose-maintenance period.

The primary efficacy outcome for the two studies was defined as the change from baseline at Week 12 in the number of binge days per week. Baseline is defined as the weekly average of the number of binge days per week for the 14 days prior to the baseline visit. Subjects from both studies on VYVANSE had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline in mean number of binge days per week at Week 12. In addition, subjects on VYVANSE showed greater improvement as compared to placebo across key secondary outcomes with higher proportion of subjects rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale, higher proportion of subjects with 4-week binge cessation, and greater reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) [^5c57078a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized withdrawal design study (Study 13) was conducted to evaluate maintenance of efficacy based on time to relapse between VYVANSE and placebo in adults aged 18 to 55 (N = 267) with moderate to severe BED. In this longer-term study patients who had responded to VYVANSE in the preceding 12-week open-label treatment phase were randomized to continuation of VYVANSE or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response in the open-label phase was defined as 1 or fewer binge days each week for four consecutive weeks prior to the last visit at the end of the 12-week open-label phase and a CGI-S score of 2 or less at the same visit. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as having 2 or more binge days each week for two consecutive weeks (14 days) prior to any visit and having an increase in CGI-S score of 2 or more points compared to the randomized-withdrawal baseline. Maintenance of efficacy for patients who had an initial response during the open-label period and then continued on VYVANSE during the 26-week double-blind randomized-withdrawal phase was demonstrated with VYVANSE being superior over placebo as measured by time to relapse.

Examination of population subgroups based on age (there were no patients over 65), gender, and race did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness in the treatment of BED.

4 DISCUSSION

The key findings of this report are that the treatment effects of LDX versus placebo were observed as early as the first week of treatment across multiple endpoints (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, 1‐week binge eating response, dichotomized improvement on the CGI‐I, and percentage change in body weight from baseline) and at Week 4 on Y‐BOCS‐BE total and domain scores (the first time point assessed). Furthermore, improvements were maintained for the duration of the 12‐week studies. These results support the relatively rapid efficacy of LDX in reducing both binge eating behavior and binge eating‐related psychopathology in two studies (McElroy et al. 2015a) in which 12 weeks of dose‐optimized LDX was shown to produce significantly greater improvement than placebo at the end of the study on several of these same measures. Consistent with the results of the Phase 2 study (McElroy et al. 2015b), this post hoc analysis revealed a possible treatment effect at Week 1, when 30 mg LDX was being taken by study participants. This finding is difficult to explain because 30 mg LDX was not statistically superior to placebo in reducing log‐transformed binge eating days/week at the Week 11 (the primary endpoint) in the Phase 2 study (McElroy et al. 2015b). Although 30 mg LDX is a recommended starting titration dose for the treatment of BED (Vyvanse ®, 2015), it was not studied as a target treatment dose based largely on the Phase 3 pivotal studies in which 30 mg LDX was used only as an initial titration dose and not studied as a target dose (McElroy et al. 2015a). Additional research with a study design focused on this research question would be needed to draw firmer conclusions.

Adults: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 7) was conducted in adults ages 18 to 55 (N = 420) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of VYVANSE or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 7 in Table 6).

The second study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, modified analog classroom study (Study 8) of VYVANSE to simulate a workplace environment in 142 adults ages 18 to 55 who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD. There was a 4-week open-label, dose optimization phase with VYVANSE (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 70 mg/day in the morning). Patients were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: 1) VYVANSE (optimized dose) followed by placebo, each for one week, or 2) placebo followed by VYVANSE, each for one week. Efficacy assessments occurred at the end of each week, using the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD. PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. VYVANSE treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in attention across all post-dose time points, as measured by average PERMP total scores over the course of one assessment day, as well as at each time point measured. The PERMP assessments were administered at pre-dose (-0.5 hours) and at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14 hours post-dose (Study 8 in Table 6, Figure 6).

14.2 Binge Eating Disorder (BED)

A phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of VYVANSE 30, 50 and 70 mg/day compared to placebo in reducing the number of binge days/week in adults with at least moderate to severe BED. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose titration study (Study 10) consisted of an 11-week double-blind treatment period (3 weeks of forced-dose titration followed by 8 weeks of dose maintenance). VYVANSE 30 mg/day was not statistically different from placebo on the primary endpoint. The 50 and 70 mg/day doses were statistically superior to placebo on the primary endpoint.

The efficacy of VYVANSE in the treatment of BED was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization studies (Study 11 and Study 12) in adults aged 18–55 years (Study 11: N = 374, Study 12: N = 350) with moderate to severe BED. A diagnosis of BED was confirmed using DSM-IV criteria for BED. Severity of BED was determined based on having at least 3 binge days per week for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and on having a Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 4 at the baseline visit. For both studies, a binge day was defined as a day with at least 1 binge episode, as determined from the subject's daily binge diary.

### Lisdexamfetamine for treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^9cc92231]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and describe its potential place in therapy.

Data Sources

Primary literature published between January 1, 1990, and August 1, 2008, was selected from PubMed using the search key words lisdexamfetamine, Vyvanse, and NRP104. References of selected publications were also reviewed. Posters and abstracts of research presented at national meetings were reviewed when available. The product labeling for Vyvanse was also used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Preference was given to published, randomized, and controlled research describing the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of lisdexamfetamine. Noncontrolled studies, postmarketing reports, and poster presentations were considered secondly. All published studies were included.

Data Synthesis

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine covalently bound to l-lysine, which is activated during first-pass metabolism. The unique pharmacokinetic profile owing to lisdexamfetamine's prodrug design and rate-limited enzymatic biotransformation allows for once-daily dosing with a duration of activity of approximately 12 hours. Lisdexamfetamine has been proven to reduce the symptoms of ADHD both in children aged 6–12 years and adults aged 18–55 years, decreasing ADHD rating scale scores by approximately 27 and 19 points, respectively. Adverse effects with an incidence greater than 10% during preclinical trials included appetite suppression, insomnia, and headache. Lisdexamfetamine's unique pharmacokinetic properties may provide additional safety with regard to reducing abuse potential. As with other central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, concerns regarding sudden cardiac death and adverse effects on growth also apply to lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine provides another amphetamine-based CNS stimulant option for treatment of children and adults with ADHD. However, its use may be limited by a lack of significant differentiation when compared with currently used stimulants and a lack of evidence to support its use in adolescents.

### The effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on eating behaviour and homeostatic, reward and cognitive processes in women with binge-eating symptoms: an experimental medicine study [^c52fd00a]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most common specific eating disorder, and the estimated lifetime global prevalence is between 0.9–2.2.%. In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) (Vyvanse ®, Takeda) as the first and, to date, only drug for the treatment of BED. This approval was based on the results of two phase-III, 12-week randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation studies in adults with BED. In both studies, 50 and 70 mg LDX reduced binge-eating episodes and weight as compared to placebo. Since then, evidence has accumulated to suggest that LDX is an effective treatment for BED. There is also evidence that LDX reduces food intake in preclinical models of binge eating in rodents.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of both clinical and preclinical studies on the effects of LDX on binge eating found a poverty of studies examining the neural and cognitive processes that underpin LDX's effects in ameliorating BED symptoms. Schneider et al. proposed that LDX may reduce binge eating by a combination of effects on appetite/satiety, reward, and cognitive processes that are mediated by actions of LDX on catecholaminergic and serotoninergic transmission. There is considerable potential to use the power of experimental medicine to explore the mechanism of action of LDX in treating BED. Only a single pilot fMRI study with LDX in BED has been conducted to date, and this study did not include a placebo control group. LDX is a stimulant drug and classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). An improved understanding of the neuropsychological processes impacted by LDX could aid in the development of novel medications to treat BED, with improved efficacy and fewer side effects that are not schedule controlled by the DEA.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^24abced0]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved for use in adults with moderate to severe binge‐eating disorder (BED) in the United States (Vyvanse ®, 2015). In two large, identically designed, 12‐week, dose‐optimized, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, Phase 3 studies in adults with protocol‐defined moderate to severe BED, dose‐optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg/day) produced statistically superior and clinically meaningful reductions in binge eating days/week at weeks 11–12 (primary efficacy endpoint) versus placebo (McElroy et al. 2015a). In these Phase 3 trials, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements on secondary efficacy endpoints were also observed for LDX versus placebo at Week 12/early termination (ET) for including Clinical Global Impressions — Improvement (CGI‐I) and 4‐week binge eating cessation and at Week 12 for Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y‐BOCS‐BE) and percentage change in body weight (McElroy et al. 2015a). In a Phase 2, fixed‐dose, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, LDX (50 and 70 mg but not 30 mg) was also superior to placebo in decreasing binge eating days/week in adults with BED at Week 11 (McElroy et al. 2015b). In these short‐term studies (McElroy et al. 2015a, 2015b), the safety and tolerability of LDX were generally similar to its established profile for LDX treatment of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Vyvanse ®, 2015).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and BED is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate have been conducted in healthy adult (capsule and chewable tablet formulations) and pediatric (6 to 12 years) patients with ADHD (capsule formulation). After single dose administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, pharmacokinetics of dextroamphetamine was found to be linear between 30 mg and 70 mg in a pediatric study (6 to 12 years), and between 50 mg and 250 mg in an adult study. Dextroamphetamine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults exhibited low inter-subject (< 25%) and intra-subject (< 8%) variability. There is no accumulation of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine at steady state in healthy adults.

Weight Loss and Slowing Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients with ADHD

In a controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), mean weight loss from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 1 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years who received VYVANSE over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a slowing in growth rate, measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.9 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight loss from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 2.0 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

VYVANSE has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of VYVANSE exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. VYVANSE can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing VYVANSE, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store VYVANSE in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give VYVANSE to anyone else. Throughout VYVANSE treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid VYVANSE use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases.

Monitor all VYVANSE-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for adults with major depressive disorder and inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy: results from 2 phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^2c7aaa26]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) from two phase 3 studies are reported.

Methods

Across study 1 (placebo, n = 201; LDX, n = 201) and study 2 (placebo, n = 213; LDX, n = 211), most participants (placebo and LDX) in the safety analysis set were female (study 1: 66.2% and 64.2%; study 2: 67.1% and 66.8%); mean ± SD ages were 41.8 ± 12.04 with placebo and 42.2 ± 12.32 with LDX in study 1 and 42.6 ± 11.41 with placebo and 42.0 ± 11.63 with LDX in study 2. Participants (18–65 y) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores ≥ 24. Eight-week antidepressant lead-in phases prospectively assessed antidepressant response. Then, 8 weeks of randomized (1:1), double-blind treatment with dose-optimized LDX (20-70mg) or placebo in participants exhibiting inadequate antidepressant monotherapy responses (augmentation baseline MADRS total scores ≥ 18 and < 50% MADRS total score reductions from lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline) was initiated. The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Results

Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P = 0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P = 0.583). The only TEAE reported by > 5% of LDX participants at twice the placebo rate in both studies was dry mouth.

Limitations

Limitations include the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities/active medical disorders, the inability to assess specific MDD symptom domains (eg, anhedonia, cognition) or subtypes, the use of telephone-based depression assessments, and the potential influence of placebo response.

Conclusion

Contrary to expectations, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^3e1fbdde]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although medications other than LDX have been investigated for potential use as BED pharmacotherapy in double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials, LDX is the only medication currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe BED (Vyvanse ®, 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first publication describing time course analyses of treatment effects by week for the efficacy of a pharmacotherapy in individuals with BED. Based on available data from short‐term studies for other potential BED therapies, numerically greater reductions in binge eating frequency and body weight for active treatment versus placebo are generally observed within 1–4 weeks of starting treatment (Appolinario et al. 2003; Guerdjikova et al. 2012; Hudson et al. 1998; McElroy et al. 2003, 2000, 2007; Wilfley et al. 2008). In one study that reported statistical analysis of treatment effects prior to the end of the study, significantly greater reductions in binge eating days/week and weight for sibutramine versus placebo were reported at treatment Weeks 2 and 4, respectively (Appolinario et al. 2003).

2.4 Data presentation and statistical analyses

Statistically significant findings for the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in binge eating days/week at Weeks 11–12) and key secondary endpoints (improvement on the dichotomized CGI‐I at Week 12/ET, 4‐week binge cessation at Week 12/ET, percentage body weight change from baseline at Week 12, and Y‐BOCS‐BE total score change from baseline at Week 12) have previously been reported (McElroy et al. 2015a). Time course assessments of efficacy‐related endpoints are described in this report.

Statistical assessments were conducted in the full analysis set (participants taking ≥ 1 study drug dose and having ≥ 1 postbaseline primary efficacy assessment). The time course analyses presented in the current report are analyzed with the same procedures previously described for the prespecified endpoints (McElroy et al. 2015a). Mixed‐effects models for repeated measures analysis over all postbaseline visits, using an unstructured covariance matrix with treatment, visit, and the treatment × visit interaction included as factors and baseline score as a covariate and its interaction with visit also included in the model, were used to determine least squares (LS) mean treatment differences (LDX — placebo) in the change from baseline for binge eating days/week, binge‐eating episodes/week, percentage body weight change, and Y‐BOCS‐BE total and domain scores; effects size (ES) size was determined based on the estimated standard deviation from the unstructured covariance matrix. Degrees of freedom were calculated using the Kenward‐Roger approximation method. Treatment comparisons between LDX and placebo in the percentage of participants categorized as improved on the dichotomized CGI‐I were analyzed using χ² tests; odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as LDX/placebo. For 1‐week binge eating response (percentage reductions in binge eating episodes/week), differences in the distribution of responses between LDX and placebo were compared using a covariate‐adjusted Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method, with baseline binge eating episodes/week included as the covariate. Cramer's V was calculated using a 2 × 4 contingency table at each visit to assess the association between the treatment group and binge eating response; values range from 0 (no association) to 1 (complete association).

Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients ages 7 to 13 years (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and -2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Weight Loss in Adults with ADHD

In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), mean weight loss after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with VYVANSE, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating VYVANSE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

2.2 General Administration Information

Take VYVANSE orally in the morning with or without food; avoid afternoon doses because of the potential for insomnia. VYVANSE may be administered in one of the following ways:

Information for VYVANSE capsules:

Swallow VYVANSE capsules whole, or
Open capsules, empty and mix the entire contents with yogurt, water, or orange juice. If the contents of the capsule include any compacted powder, a spoon may be used to break apart the powder. The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. Consume the entire mixture immediately. It should not be stored. The active ingredient dissolves completely once dispersed; however, a film containing the inactive ingredients may remain in the glass or container once the mixture is consumed.

Information for VYVANSE chewable tablets:

VYVANSE chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.

VYVANSE capsules can be substituted with VYVANSE chewable tablets on a unit per unit/mg per mg basis (for example, 30 mg capsules for 30 mg chewable tablet) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not take anything less than one capsule or chewable tablet per day. A single dose should not be divided.

2.3 Dosage for Treatment of ADHD

The recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older is 30 mg once daily in the morning. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 10 mg or 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals up to maximum recommended dosage of 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.4 Dosage for Treatment of Moderate to Severe BED in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults is 30 mg once daily to be titrated in increments of 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended target dose of 50 mg to 70 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Discontinue VYVANSE if binge eating does not improve.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and researchprograms/pregnancyregistry/adhd-medications/.

Risk Summary

The limited available data from published literature and postmarketing reports on use of VYVANSE in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature delivery and low birth weight, have been seen in infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (a prodrug of d-amphetamine) had no effects on embryo-fetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis. Pre- and postnatal studies were not conducted with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. However, amphetamine (d- to l- ratio of 3:1) administration to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine. In addition, adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine. Long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Amphetamines, such as VYVANSE, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to amphetamine-dependent mothers have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.

Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.

5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis

CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder

CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode. Prior to initiating VYVANSE treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).

New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms

CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing VYVANSE.

5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.

In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the VYVANSE groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in VYVANSE-treated pediatric patients. Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. VYVANSE is not approved for use in pediatric patients below 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^61bc7ead]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although the main findings for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints from the Phase 3 studies of LDX have been published (McElroy et al. 2015a), these analyses only examined change from baseline to end of study (Week 12 or Week 12/ET). Statistical assessment of the time course of effects of LDX on efficacy‐related endpoints from these studies has not yet been reported. Such data are important because they provide an indication of how soon treatment effects may be anticipated after the therapy is initiated. The current report describes the time course of effects of LDX on efficacy‐related endpoints (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, percentage of participants exhibiting improvement on the dichotomized CGI‐I, percentage of participants exhibiting 1‐week binge eating response, percentage change in body weight, and Y‐BOCS‐BE total and subscale score changes) in the two previously described 12‐week treatment Phase 3 clinical studies (McElroy et al. 2015a).

9.1 Controlled Substance

VYVANSE contains lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

VYVANSE has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. VYVANSE can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^ce7c387c]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Binge-eating disorder (BED), a public health problem associated with psychopathological symptoms and obesity and possibly with metabolic syndrome, lacks approved pharmacotherapies.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a dextroamphetamine prodrug, to treat moderate to severe BED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We performed a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, forced dose titration, placebo-controlled clinical trial at 30 sites from May 10, 2011, through January 30, 2012. Safety and intention-to-treat analyses included 259 and 255 adults with BED, respectively.

Interventions

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate at dosages of 30, 50, or 70 mg/d or placebo were provided to study participants (1:1:1:1). Dosages were titrated across 3 weeks and maintained for 8 weeks. We followed up participants for a mean (SD) of 7 (2) days after the last dose.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We assessed the change in binge-eating (BE) behaviors measured as days per week (baseline to week 11) with a mixed-effects model using transformed log (BE days per week)+1. Secondary measures included BE cessation for 4 weeks. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and change in weight.

Results

At week 11, log-transformed BE days per week decreased with the 50-mg/d (least squares [LS] mean [SE] change, -1.49 [0.066]; P = 0.008) and 70-mg/d (LS mean [SE] change, -1.57 [0.067]; P < .001) treatment groups but not the 30-mg/d treatment group (LS mean [SE] change, -1.24 [0.067]; P = 0.88) compared with the placebo group. Nontransformed mean (SD) days per week decreased for placebo and the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups by -3.3 (2.04), -3.5 (1.95), -4.1 (1.52), and -4.1 (1.57), respectively. The percentage of participants achieving 4-week BE cessation was lower with the placebo group (21.3%) compared with the 50-mg/d (42.2% [P = 0.01]) and 70-mg/d (50.0% [P < .001]) treatment groups. The incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse events was 58.7% for the placebo group and 84.7% for the combined treatment group. In the treatment groups, 1.5% of participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse effects. Events with a frequency of at least 5% and changes in heart rate were generally consistent with the known safety profile. The mean (SD) change in body weight was -0.1 (3.09), -3.1 (3.64), -4.9 (4.43), -4.9 (3.93), and -4.3 (4.09) kg for the placebo group, the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups, and the combined treatment groups, respectively (P < .001 for each dose vs placebo group comparison in post hoc analysis).

Conclusions and Relevance

The 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups demonstrated efficacy compared with the placebo group in decreased BE days, BE cessation, and global improvement. The safety profile was generally consistent with previous findings in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Further investigation of lisdexamfetamine in BED is ongoing.

European and US patients (6–17 years; N = 276) with ADHD were entered into a 26-week open-label trial of LDX treatment. Those who completed the open-label period (n = 157) were randomized 1:1 to their optimized dose of LDX (30, 50, or 70 mg per day) or placebo for a 6-week randomized-withdrawal period (RWP). The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients meeting treatment failure criteria (≥ 50% increase in ADHD Rating Scale IV total score and ≥ 2-point increase in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness [CGI-S] score, compared with RWP start point). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

During the RWP (LDX, n = 78; placebo, n = 79), significantly fewer patients receiving LDX met treatment failure criteria (15.8%) compared with those receiving placebo (67.5%; difference = -51.7%; 95% confidence interval = -65.0, -38.5; p < .001). Most treatment failures occurred at or before the week 2 visit after randomization. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 39.7% and 25.3% of patients receiving LDX and placebo, respectively, during the RWP.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate the maintenance of efficacy of LDX during long-term treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. The rapid return of symptoms on LDX withdrawal demonstrates the need for continuing treatment. The safety profile of LDX was consistent with that of other stimulants.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine. Based on limited case reports in published literature, amphetamine (d-or d, l-) is present in human milk, at relative infant doses of 2% to 13.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.9 and 7.5. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from amphetamine exposure are unknown. It is possible that large dosages of dextroamphetamine might interfere with milk production, especially in women whose lactation is not well established. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, including serious cardiovascular reactions, blood pressure and heart rate increase, suppression of growth, and peripheral vasculopathy, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with VYVANSE.

ADHD

Safety and effectiveness of VYVANSE have been established in pediatric patients with ADHD ages 6 to 17 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Safety and effectiveness of VYVANSE have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years.

Safety and efficacy of VYVANSE were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in pediatric patients ages 4 to 5 years with ADHD, followed by a 1-year open-label extension study. In these studies, patients experienced elevated rates of adverse reactions, including weight loss, decreased BMI, decreased appetite, insomnia, infections (upper respiratory and nasopharyngitis), irritability, and affect lability.

With the same VYVANSE dose, mean steady state exposure of dextroamphetamine was approximately 44% higher in pediatric patients ages 4 to 5 years compared to the pediatric patients ages 6 to 11 years.

BED

Safety and effectiveness of VYVANSE have not been established in pediatric patients with BED less than 18 years of age.

Growth Suppression

Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including VYVANSE, and pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for withdrawal symptoms and sedation. The active metabolite of lisdexamfetamine crosses the placenta. Amphetamines induce vasoconstriction, potentially reducing blood flow to the placenta. Furthermore, they may stimulate uterine contractions, increasing the risk of preterm labor and low birth weight. The drug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

2 METHOD

2.1 Study design and treatment

Detailed descriptions of study designs and participants have been reported (McElroy et al. 2015a). In brief, two randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicenter studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01718483 [referred to hereafter as Study 1] andidentifier: NCT01718509 [referred to hereafter as Study 2]) were conducted. Study protocols were approved by ethics committees, and both studies were conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent before entering the studies.

Each study included a 2‐week screening phase, a 12‐week double‐blind phase (4 weeks of dose optimization followed by 8 weeks of dose maintenance), and a follow‐up visit. After screening, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 12 weeks of dose‐optimized LDX or matching placebo. For blinding, both treatments were identical in appearance. Treatment was initiated with 30 mg LDX during Week 1 and titrated to 50 mg LDX at the start of Week 2. During Week 3, dose increases to 70 mg LDX could be made based on tolerability and clinical need. After the LDX dose was increased to 70 mg, a single down‐titration to 50 mg was allowed during Week 3 if tolerability to 70 mg LDX was poor. If a dose reduction occurred, no further changes were allowed. During Weeks 4 to 12, the optimized LDX dosage (50 or 70 mg) was maintained. Because no dose changes were permitted beyond Week 3, participants requiring a dose reduction during the maintenance phase were discontinued. A follow‐up visit occurred 1 week after the final treatment visit (Week 12 or ET) to assess any ongoing or new safety and tolerability issues.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^3e317bd0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Background:

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

Methods:

Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.

Results:

For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were −1.4 (−3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (−2.5, 2.7), −0.7 (−3.4, 2.0), and −0.9 (−3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant dose-responses for all candidate dose-response curves (all p < 0.10), with increases observed as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit. Mean ± standard deviation changes from augmentation baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse at week 16/early termination were −0.7 ± 9.90 and −0.3 ± 7.24 mm Hg and 0.2 ± 10.57 bpm with placebo and were 1.9 ± 9.47 and 0.8 ± 7.40 mm Hg and 3.6 ± 9.74 bpm with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (all doses combined). The safety and tolerability profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with previous studies.

Conclusions:

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation did not provide benefit over placebo in adults with inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy based on the assessed efficacy measures.

Study design and treatment

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, forced-dose titration, dose-finding study (identifier: NCT01435759) was conducted at 76 sites across five countries (USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the UK) between 31 May 2011–17 January 2014. The study included a screening and washout phase (1–4 weeks), an eight-week single-blind antidepressant lead-in phase, an eight-week double-blind treatment phase (three weeks of forced-dose titration followed by five weeks of dose maintenance), and a one-week follow-up phase (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Study timeline and dose adjustment schedule for (a) randomized and (b) nonrandomized participants.

LDX: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate; V: visit; Wk: week.

During the lead-in antidepressant phase, which was designed to prospectively identify inadequate responders, investigators assigned unblinded antidepressant therapy (ESC or venlafaxine extended-release (VXR)) along with single-blind LDX-matching placebo to participants. Antidepressant treatment, which was based on investigator assessment of clinical factors (including prior antidepressant use, response, and tolerability), was initiated at the lowest dose allowed on the morning following the lead-in baseline visit if the participant was not already receiving the assigned antidepressant. If the participant was already taking one of the two background antidepressants (ESC or VXR) at study entry, the treatment regimen was maintained. Treatment assignment was monitored to ensure an adequate representation of each type of antidepressant in the overall study population. Participants already taking the assigned antidepressant started this phase at their current dose. Doses were subsequently titrated to the maximum tolerated dose over four weeks, after which time dose adjustments were not permitted. If a participant required a dose decrease or needed to be discontinued from treatment, the dose was tapered according to labeled guidelines. Assessments of vital signs, adverse events (AEs), and C-SSRS responses were made in conjunction with dose decreases.

Materials and methods

Participants

Eligible participants were men or nonpregnant/nonnursing women (18–65 years) with a primary diagnosis of nonpsychotic MDD, as defined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders–Clinical Trial version (SCID-CT), that had lasted for at least eight weeks before screening and who had a lead-in baseline MADRS total score ⩾24. All eligible participants also had to be able to provide written informed consent before completing any study-related procedures and be willing and able to fully comply with study procedures.

Key exclusion criteria included nonresponse (⩾6 weeks of treatment at the maximum tolerated adult dose approved for MDD) to the current MDD episode with two or more antidepressant monotherapies or to an approved augmentation treatment; and a lifetime history of treatment-resistant depression, defined as having not responded to adequate treatment (⩾8 weeks of treatment at the maximum tolerated dose within the dose range approved for adults with MDD) with two or more treatment regimens, including distinct classes of approved antidepressant monotherapies and augmentation treatments. Participants were excluded if they had a history of treatment-resistant depression because the objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of LDX as augmentation therapy in participants with a minimal history of previous failed antidepressant treatments, and not to assess LDX as a possible therapy for treatment-resistant depression. As such, the inclusion of individuals with treatment-resistant depression was considered to have an unfavorable risk-benefit balance.

Background

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

Methods

Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.

Results

For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were -1.4 (-3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (-2.5, 2.7), -0.7 (-3.4, 2.0), and -0.9 (-3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant dose-responses for all candidate dose-response curves (all p < 0.10), with increases observed as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment response to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate versus placebo in adults with binge eating disorder: analysis by gender and age [^e03beac4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe clinical characteristics and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) treatment effects, based on gender and age, in adults diagnosed with moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED).

Methods

Adults diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision-defined BED of moderate to severe severity were randomized to 12 weeks of dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg) or placebo in 2 studies (conducted from November 26, 2012, to September 25, 2013 [study 1] and from November 26, 2012, to September 20, 2013 [study 2]). These post hoc analyses pooled data by gender (men vs women) and age (< 40 vs ≥ 40 years) across studies; reported P values are nominal (descriptive and unadjusted).

Results

The pooled safety analysis and full analysis sets included 745 and 724 participants, respectively (men, n = 105 and n = 97; women, n = 640 and n = 627; < 40 years, n = 398 and n = 386; ≥ 40 years, n = 347 and n = 338). Across subgroups, most participants had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (63.0%-75.5%). The mean baseline number of binge eating days/wk was comparable across gender (4.6–4.7) and age (4.6–4.9), as was Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score (gender, 20.42–21.70; age, 21.40–21.63). Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences nominally favored LDX in all subgroups (all P < .001) for changes from baseline in binge eating days/wk at weeks 11–12 and in Y-BOCS-BE total score at week 12; no interactions by gender or age were reported. Consistent with the overall profile of LDX, across all subgroups LDX was associated with higher frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events than placebo and with increases in blood pressure and pulse.

Conclusions

Across gender and age, participants exhibited comparable clinical characteristics and responses to dose-optimized LDX compared with placebo.

Stimulants have long been considered possible treatment options for MDD, in part because of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression and its associated symptoms, such as anhedonia and lethargy. Methylphenidate was first investigated for the treatment of MDD as early as the 1950s. In addition, meta-analyses identified multiple trials from 2003 onward that investigated stimulants or modafinil as adjuncts for antidepressants.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a d-amphetamine pro-drug, is approved in the USA and in other countries for use in individuals aged six years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder in the USA and Canada (Vyvanse ® Product Monograph; Vyvanse ® Product Monograph). The effects of LDX augmentation therapy on depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD have been examined in two small phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept studies and in two large phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In the first phase 2 study, LDX augmentation of escitalopram oxalate (ESC) monotherapy met predefined signal-detection criteria (prespecified critical α = 0.10) for significant reductions in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score versus placebo in patients whose depression had not remitted with escitalopram monotherapy. The second phase 2 study focused on executive dysfunction in participants with partially to fully remitted MDD (MADRS total score ≤ 18) and found that LDX augmentation of SSRI monotherapy produced significant MADRS total score reductions versus placebo. In contrast, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy in either of the phase 3 studies.

5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon

CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosages of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant.

Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during VYVANSE treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for VYVANSE-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy.

Drug exposure

Final ESC or VXR doses at the end of the lead-in antidepressant phase in each treatment group are summarized in Table 1. All participants randomized to 10 and 30 mg LDX received those doses as the maximum dose during double-blind treatment. Four participants randomized to 50 mg LDX were down-titrated to 30 mg LDX; among participants randomized to 70 mg LDX, five were down-titrated to 50 mg LDX, and four were down-titrated to 30 mg LDX. The mean ± SD daily LDX dose was 9.7 ± 1.37 for 10 mg LDX, 29.4 ± 2.72 for 30 mg LDX, 42.9 ± 8.58 for 50 mg LDX, and 57.3 ± 12.19 for 70 mg LDX. The mean ± SD duration of exposure (in days) was 53.5 ± 10.30 for placebo, 53.8 ± 10.04 for 10 mg LDX, 52.2 ± 11.86 for 30 mg LDX, 53.9 ± 10.47 for 50 mg LDX, and 52.5 ± 11.14 for 70 mg LDX.

Efficacy endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint

No significant dose-response relationships were detected for the MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline for any of the candidate dose-response curves (Table 2).

Studies of VYVANSE in Drug Abusers

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-control, cross-over, abuse liability study in 38 patients with a history of drug abuse was conducted with single-doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg of VYVANSE, 40 mg of immediate-release d-amphetamine sulphate (a controlled II substance), and 200 mg of diethylpropion hydrochloride (a controlled IV substance). VYVANSE 100 mg produced significantly less "Drug Liking Effects" as measured by the Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject score, compared to d-amphetamine 40 mg; and 150 mg of VYVANSE demonstrated similar "Drug-Liking Effects" compared to 40 mg of d-amphetamine and 200 mg of diethylpropion.

Intravenous administration of 50 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to individuals with a history of drug abuse produced positive subjective responses on scales measuring "Drug Liking", "Euphoria", "Amphetamine Effects", and "Benzedrine Effects" that were greater than placebo but less than those produced by an equivalent dose (20 mg) of intravenous d-amphetamine.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

VYVANSE may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including VYVANSE include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

VYVANSE may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### Use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in treatment of executive functioning deficits and chronic fatigue syndrome: a double blind, placebo-controlled study [^e772f212]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) for the treatment of executive functioning deficits in adults (ages 18–60) with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The study's primary outcome measure was the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). Secondary outcome measures were standardized assessments of fatigue, pain and global functioning. Twenty-six adults who met criteria for CFS and had clinically significant executive functioning deficits were randomly assigned to a flexible morning dose (30, 50, 70 mg/day) of either placebo or LDX for a 6-week trial. The data were analyzed with standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures. Participants in the LDX group showed significantly more positive change in BRIEF-A scores (Mchange = 21.38, SD = 15.85) than those in the placebo group (Mchange = 3.36, SD = 7.26). Participants in the active group also reported significantly less fatigue and generalized pain relative to the placebo group. Although future studies with LDX should examine whether these benefits generalize to larger, more diverse samples of patients, these results suggest that LDX could be a safe and efficacious treatment for the executive functioning deficits often associated with CFS. The possibility that dopaminergic medications could play an important role addressing the symptoms of CFS is also discussed.

### Human pharmacology of intravenous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate: abuse liability in adult stimulant abusers [^26249fb7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and abuse liability of single intravenous (i.v.) doses of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and immediate-release d-amphetamine sulphate in adult stimulant abusers compared with placebo. Adult substance abusers were enrolled in this phase I, randomized, single-centre, double-blind study. An initial cohort of three subjects was enrolled to assess safety followed by a primary cohort that consisted of nine subjects. Single i.v. doses of LDX (25 or 50 mg), immediate-release d-amphetamine sulphate (10 or 20 mg) or placebo were administered at a minimum of 48-h intervals in a single-dose, three-way crossover design. 20 mg of d-amphetamine showed significantly increased abuse-related liking scores compared with placebo (P < 0.05), whereas the liking effects of 50 mg LDX did not significantly differ from placebo. The mean C(max) of d-amphetamine was 38.9 ± 8.1 and 105 ± 91.4 ng/ml after the administration of 50 mg LDX and 20 mg d-amphetamine respectively. The mean T(max) of d-amphetamine was 2.51 h after the administration of 50 mg LDX and 0.82 h after the administration of 20 mg d-amphetamine. LDX was well tolerated in this population. In contrast to d-amphetamine, LDX administered intravenously did not produce significant subjective abuse-related liking scores at assessed doses.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Participant disposition and demographics

Participant disposition has previously been reported (McElroy et al. 2015a). In brief, most randomized participants completed each study. A total of 68 participants did not complete Study 1 and 96 participants did not complete Study 2. Relatively few participants discontinued because of adverse events or lack of efficacy. The full analysis set included 374 participants in Study 1 and 350 participants in Study 2.

In Study 1 and Study 2, respectively, most participants in the full analysis set were white (77.8% [291/374] and 74.0% [259/350]), were women (86.9% [325/374] and 86.3% [302/350]), and met criteria for obesity (BMI ≥ 30.0 but < 35 kg/m²: 25.4% [95/374] and 27.7% [97/350]; BMI ≥ 35.0 but < 40 kg/m²: 24.1% [90/374] and 22.3% [78/350]; BMI ≥ 40.0 kg/m²: 17.6% [66/374] and 19.7% [69/350]). Mean ± SD age and BMI, respectively, were 38.0 ± 10.32 years and 33.43 ± 6.245 kg/m² in Study 1 and 38.0 ± 10.04 years and 33.61 ± 6.272 kg/m² in Study 2.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^7a96cb70]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

One‐hundred and eighteen participants were enrolled pre‐pandemic [97 (63%) reached the primary endpoint prior to pandemic measures and 21 (14%) were on study at the onset], and 37 (24%) participants were enrolled after post‐pandemic restrictions were eased. Compared to those randomised prior to pandemic onset, the post‐pandemic cohort showed an increase in the proportion of university educated (14–35%; P = 0.002) and gay men (13–23%; P = 0.04), with one inner‐city site (site 4) representing a larger proportion of overall recruitment during this time (18–32%; P = 0.02).

At the primary end‐point (Week 13), the primary outcome measure was collected for 50 (60%) in the placebo group and 50 (63%) in the lisdexamfetamine group. Eighty‐nine participants (57%) were retained in treatment at Week 13, with no difference between groups: 55% (95% CI = 45–67%) in the placebo group compared to 60% (95% CI = 50–72%) in the lisdexamfetamine group (P = 0.64) (Figure 2). There were no significant differences in treatment retention between those enrolled pre‐ and post‐pandemic onset.

FIGURE 2
Retention rate.

Primary outcome

An OR of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.29–1.82; P = 0.49) was estimated for the difference between the lisdexamfetamine and placebo groups in the expected daily probability of methamphetamine use in the 28 days prior to the week 13 visit (Figure 3), the primary outcome, corresponding to an estimated difference of 2.2 fewer days use in the lisdexamfetamine group (95% CI = –0.5 to 5.0, Table 2), was a weak finding. These results, which employ a MAR assumption, are consistent with sensitivity analyses under a 'return‐to‐baseline' MNAR assumption, where the estimated OR was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.36–1.27; P = 0.23) and difference in days of use was 2.2 (95% CI = –0.1 to‐‐ 4.4).

Statistical methods and sample size

Dose-response relationships for the primary efficacy endpoint (change in MADRS total score from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET) and for vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse) were assessed using the multiple comparisons procedure with modeling (MCP-Mod) approach. Briefly, the MCP-Mod technique starts with a set of pre-specified candidate dose-response curves and uses a multiple-comparisons technique to test whether any of these curves fit the data significantly better than does a flat line (indicative of no dose response). If at least one of the pre-specified candidate models is significant, then this is indicative of a dose response. Any significant curves are then used to develop inferences on adequate treatment doses and for estimating the minimum effective dose. This method has been adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency as an efficient statistical methodology for the analysis of phase 2 dose-finding studies under dose-response uncertainty. The pre-specified dose-response curves tested for MADRS total score change (Emax, logistic, linear, and betaMod) are depicted in Figure 2; dose-response curves tested for vital signs were Emax, exponential, linear, logistic 1, logistic 2. Placebo was considered 0 mg LDX.

Figure 2.
Prespecified candidate dose-response curves used for multiple comparisons procedure with modeling (MCP-Mod) assessment of Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

The MADRS dose-response was assessed in the dose-response evaluable set (DRES), which included all randomized participants having ⩾1 primary efficacy assessment during the dose-maintenance portion of double-blind treatment (i.e. after the three-week forced-titration phase). The most recent MADRS score was carried forward for missing scores during the dose-maintenance phase. As such, a last observation carried forward analysis was effectively performed for the primary analysis. The results of the primary analysis, which used the dose-response evaluable set, were verified in the full analysis set using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) as a sensitivity analysis. Vital sign dose-responses were assessed based on the average of the three repeated vital sign measurements per visit in the vital signs evaluable set, which included all randomized participants having ⩾1 vital sign measurement during the dose-maintenance portion of double-blind treatment.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^3c73ead2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30, 50, and 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine dimesylate compared with placebo in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Following a 7- to 28-day washout, 420 adults aged 18 to 55 years with moderate to severe ADHD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were treated with 30, 50, or 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine or placebo, respectively, for 4 weeks (N = 119, 117, 122, and 62, respectively). The 50- and 70- mg/day groups underwent forced-dose titration. The primary efficacy measure was the clinician-determined ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) total score. The study was conducted from May 2006 to November 2006.

Results

Treatment groups were well matched at baseline, including in ADHD-RS scores. At endpoint, changes in ADHD-RS scores were significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo (placebo = -8.2, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -16.2, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -17.4, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -18.6; all p < .0001 vs. placebo), with no differences between doses. Significant differences relative to placebo were observed in each lisdexamfetamine group, beginning at week 1 and for each week throughout. The percentage of subjects who improved (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale rating ≤ 2) was significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo at each week and at endpoint (placebo = 29%, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 57%, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 62%, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 61%; all p < .01). Adverse events were generally mild and included dry mouth, decreased appetite, and insomnia.

Conclusion

All 3 lisdexamfetamine doses were significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD, with improvements noted within 1 week. Lisdexamfetamine was generally well tolerated by these patients.

### The efficacy and safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a prodrug of D-amphetamine, for the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adults [^3b84ba44]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a once-daily medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (aged 6–12 years) and adults.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of LDX.

Methods

Studies, abstracts, reviews, and consensus statements published in English were identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977-August 2008) using search headings lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, NRP 104, NRP104-201, NRP104-301, NRP104-302, NRP104-303, and stimulant. Selected information provided by the manufacturer of LDX was included, as were all pertinent clinical trials. The reference lists of identified articles were also searched for pertinent information. Relevant abstracts presented at annual professional meetings were included as well.

Results

Several studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of LDX in pediatric patients (6–12 years of age) and healthy adults with ADHD. LDX, a prodrug that is therapeutically inactive until metabolized in the body to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine), follows linear pharmacokinetics at therapeutic doses (30–70 mg). The efficacy of LDX in the treatment of ADHD was established on the basis of 1 long-term and 2 short-term controlled clinical trials in children who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for ADHD (either the combined or the hyperactive-impulsive subtype) and in 1 clinical trial with adults with ADHD. The efficacy trials in children found significant improvements in scores on the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham deportment sub-scales, the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (Attempted and Correct), and the ADHD Rating Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) compared with placebo (all, P < 0.001). In the clinical studies designed to measure duration of effect, LDX, compared with placebo, provided efficacy for a full treatment day, up through and including 6 PM, based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form) in the morning, afternoon, and early evening (all, P < 0.001). Data from a long-term, open-label extension study that assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LDX for up to 12 months found LDX treatment resulted in significant improvement (> 60%) from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV at end point (P < 0.001), with good tolerability. The trial in adults found significant improvements in ADHD-RS scores at end point in patients receiving LDX (30,50, and 70 mg) (P < 0.001 for all active doses); significant improvements in ADHD-RS (using adult prompts) scores were observed at each postbaseline weekly assessment, with improvements noted within the first week in all active treatment arms. Results from human abuse liability studies noted that LDX had lower abuse-related drug-liking scores compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine at equivalent doses. The most common adverse events reported with LDX were typical of amphetamine products and included decreased appetite, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, headache, irritability, weight loss, and nausea.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of LDX as a treatment option for the management of children (aged 6–12 years) and adults with ADHD. As such, LDX may be an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that can include other measures such as psychological, educational, and social interventions.

### Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^03c29133]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The ability of pharmacotherapies to prevent relapse and maintain efficacy with long-term treatment in psychiatric conditions is important.

Objective

To assess lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multinational, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study including 418 participants was conducted at 49 clinical research study sites from January 27, 2014, to April 8, 2015. Eligible adults met DSM-IV-R binge-eating disorder criteria and had moderate to severe binge eating disorder (≥ 3 binge-eating days per week for 14 days before open-label baseline; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scores ≥ 4 [moderate severity] at screening and open-label baseline). Following a 12-week, open-label phase (dose optimization, 4 weeks [lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 50 or 70 mg]; dose maintenance, 8 weeks), lisdexamfetamine responders (≤ 1 binge eating day per week for 4 consecutive weeks and CGI-S scores ≤ 2 at week 12) were randomized to placebo or continued lisdexamfetamine during a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase.

Interventions

Lisdexamfetamine administration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome variable, time to relapse (≥ 2 binge-eating days per week for 2 consecutive weeks and ≥ 2-point CGI-S score increases from randomized withdrawal baseline), was analyzed using a log-rank test (primary analysis); the analysis was stratified for dichotomized 4-week cessation status. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

Of the 418 participants enrolled in the open-label phase of the study, 411 (358 [87.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 38.3 [10.4] years) were included in the safety analysis set. Of 275 randomized lisdexamfetamine responders (placebo, n = 138; lisdexamfetamine, n = 137), the observed proportions of participants meeting relapse criteria were 3.7% (5 of 136) for lisdexamfetamine and 32.1% (42 of 131) for placebo. Lisdexamfetamine demonstrated superiority over placebo on the log-rank test (χ²₁, 40.37; P < .001) for time to relapse; the hazard ratio, based on a Cox proportional hazards model for lisdexamfetamine vs placebo, was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.04–0.23). The treatment-emergent adverse events observed were generally consistent with the known profile of lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions and Relevance

Risk of binge-eating relapse over 6 months was lower in participants continuing lisdexamfetamine than in those randomized to placebo. The hazard for relapse was lower with lisdexamfetamine than placebo.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder who report clinically significant impairment in executive function: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^a5ca9ed9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Behavioral rating scales that assess impairments in executive function commonly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may offer advantages over neuropsychological testing. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for executive function deficits in adults with ADHD and clinically significant executive function impairment using self-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A) assessments.

Method

This randomized double-blind study, conducted between May 2010 and November 2010, screened at least 1 participant at 35 of 39 registered US clinical research sites. Adults (aged 18–55 years) with a primary ADHD diagnosis (meeting full DSM-IV-TR criteria) and executive function deficits (assessed by baseline BRIEF-A Global Executive Composite [GEC] T-scores of at least 65) were randomized to treatment with optimized lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30 mg/d, 50 mg/d, or 70 mg/d; n = 80) or placebo (n = 81) during a 10-week double-blind treatment period. Outcome measures included the BRIEF-A scales (GEC, index, and clinical subscales).

Results

At week 10 or at early termination, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was associated with significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean BRIEF-A GEC T-scores than placebo (effect size, 0.74; P < .0001) and significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean T-scores for both BRIEF-A index scales (Behavioral Regulation Index and Metacognition Index) and all 9 clinical subscales (P ≤ .0056 for all). At week 10 or at early termination, mean T-scores for BRIEF-A indexes and clinical subscales were below levels of clinically significant executive function deficits (ie, < 65) with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment. The mean (SD) GEC T-score was 57.2 (14.11) for the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate group and 68.3 (17.12) for the placebo group. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with other long-acting psychostimulants.

Conclusion

Among adults with ADHD and clinically significant executive function deficits, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was associated with significant improvements in self-reported executive function ratings.

### Maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: randomized withdrawal design [^33247fbf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Adults (aged 18–55 years) who had ADHD meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria, baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts total scores of < 22, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) ratings of 1, 2, or 3 were enrolled. After previously receiving commercially available lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) for ≥ 6 months with acceptable tolerability and maintaining response during a 3-week open-label phase at a stable lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose, the participants entered a 6-week double-blind randomized withdrawal phase on treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (same dose) or placebo. Data were collected from April 2009 to July 2010. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having symptom relapse (≥ 50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV score and ≥ 2 rating-point increase in CGI-S score).

Results

A total of 116 participants were randomized (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate n = 56; placebo n = 60). At the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV scores for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo were 10.6 (4.96) and 10.6 (4.82), respectively. At endpoint, 8.9% (5/56) of adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 75.0% (45/60) taking placebo (P < .0001) showed symptom relapse; most showed relapse after 1 and 2 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (4 and 0 adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 26 and 10 taking placebo, respectively). During the randomized withdrawal phase, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48.2% and 30.0% of participants in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events with incidence ≥ 5% in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups were headache (14.3% and 5.0%), insomnia (5.4% and 5.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (8.9% and 0%).

Conclusions

In adults with ADHD on medium- to long-term treatment, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate demonstrated maintenance of efficacy vs placebo upon randomized withdrawal. A majority of patients given placebo showed symptom relapse by 2 weeks. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was generally consistent with previous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate studies.

### Efficacy and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (NRP-104) in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study [^07ad4c8c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lisdexamfetamme dimesylate (LDX) is a therapeutically inactive amphetamine prodrug. It was developed with the goal of providing an extended duration of effect that is consistent throughout the day, with a reduced potential for abuse, overdose toxicity, and drug tampering. Following ingestion, the pharmacologically active d-amphetamine molecule is gradually released by rate-limited hydrolysis.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy and tolerability of LDX in school-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treated in the community, and to characterize the duration of action of LDX compared with placebo.

Methods

This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study was conducted at 40 centers across the United States. Male and female children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD were randomly assigned to receive LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg with forced-dose titration, or placebo, PO QD for 4 weeks. Efficacy was assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV), the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPR'), and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study.

Results

Of the 290 randomized patients (201 boys, 89 girls; mean [SD] age, 9 [1.8] years), 230 completed the trial (LDX 30 mg, n = 56; LDX 50 mg, n = 60; LDX 70 mg, n = 60; and placebo, n = 54). The most common reasons for study discontinuation (n = 60) were lack of efficacy (LDX 30 mg, 1%; LDX 50 mg, 0%; LDX 70 mg, 1%; and placebo, 17%) and adverse events (AEs) (LDX 30 mg, 9%; LDX 50 mg, 5%; LDX 70 mg, 14%; and placebo, 1%). Significant improvements in ADHD-RS-IV scores were seen with all doses of LDX compared with placebo (all, P < 0.001), and in CPRS scores with all LDX doses versus placebo throughout the day (all, P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Efficacy was observed by the first week of treatment, and improvements were observed throughout the day up to approximately 6 PM. The most frequently reported AEs among patients receiving LDX were typical of amphetamine products: decreased appetite (39% with active treatment vs 4% with placebo), insomnia (19% vs 3%), upper abdominal pain (12% vs 6%), headache (12% vs 10%), irritability (10% vs 0%), vomiting (9% vs 4%), weight decrease (9% vs 1%), and nausea (6% vs 3%); most were mild to moderate and occurred in the first week.

Conclusion

In this population of children with ADHD, treatment once daily with the prodrug LDX at doses of 30 to 70 mg appeared to be effective and had a tolerability profile similar to those of currently marketed extended-release stimulants.

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^fbed8873]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) efficacy and safety versus placebo in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Adolescents (13 through 17) with at least moderately symptomatic ADHD (ADHD Rating Scale IV: Clinician Version [ADHD-RS-IV] score ≥ 28) were randomized to placebo or LDX (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) in a 4-week, forced-dose titration, double-blind study. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the ADHD-RS-IV, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), and Youth QOL-Research Version (YQOL-R). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory findings, physical examinations, and ECG.

Results

Overall, 314 participants were randomized; 309 were in efficacy analyses and 49 withdrew (11 due to TEAEs). Least squares mean (SE) change from baseline at endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were -18.3 (1.25), -21.1 (1.28), -20.7 (1.25) for 30, 50, and 70 mg/d LDX, respectively; -12.8 (1.25) for placebo (p ≤ .0056 versus placebo for each). Differences in ADHD-RS-IV total scores favored all LDX doses versus placebo at all weeks (p ≤ .0076). On the CGI-I, 69.1% of participants were rated very much/much improved at endpoint with LDX all doses versus placebo (39.5%) (p < .0001). YQOL-R changes at endpoint scores for LDX groups versus placebo were not significant. Commonly reported LDX (all doses combined) TEAEs (≥ 5%) were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, decreased weight, and irritability. Small mean increases in pulse and blood pressure and no clinically meaningful trends in ECG changes were noted with LDX.

Conclusions

LDX at all doses was effective versus placebo in treating adolescent ADHD and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous LDX studies.

### Abuse liability and safety of oral lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in individuals with a history of stimulant abuse [^3054327c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is the first prodrug stimulant and is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated the abuse potential of single oral doses of 50, 100 (equivalent to 40 mg d-amphetamine), and 150 mg LDX, 40 mg d-amphetamine and 200 mg diethylpropion in 36 individuals with a history of stimulant abuse. On the primary abuse liability measure, maximum change of the Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject Liking Scale compared with placebo, d-amphetamine and diethylpropion showed significant differences of 4.5 and 4.0 units, respectively (P < 0.001 for both vs placebo). LDX, administered at 50, 100 and 150 mg, showed nonsignificant differences of 2.0 and 2.1 units, respectively, at the two lower doses but a significant (P < 0.001 vs placebo) difference of 6.1 units at the highest dose. Subjects significantly favoured d-amphetamine 40 mg versus LDX 100 mg (2.4 units difference; P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in liking scores between d-amphetamine 40 mg and LDX 150 mg. Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject Feel-Drug-Effect score was significantly lower for 100 mg LDX than for 40 mg d-amphetamine. There were no statistically significant differences between LDX and diethylpropion hydrochloride, a Schedule IV amphetamine-like stimulant, on abuse-related liking scores. Cardiovascular responses of LDX and d-amphetamine were similar at equivalent doses. In conclusion, at an equivalent amount of amphetamine base taken orally, LDX 100 mg had attenuated responses on measures of abuse liability compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine 40 mg. Abuse-related liking scores of LDX at a dose corresponding to a 50% higher amphetamine base (LDX 150 mg) were similar to d-amphetamine 40 mg.

### A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate as augmentation therapy in adults with residual symptoms of major depressive disorder after treatment with escitalopram [^d604e780]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder (MDD) in escitalopram nonremitters.

Method

In this proof-of-concept study (conducted from July 2009-August 2010) with a prespecified critical α = .10, adults with nonpsychotic MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) and residual depressive symptoms (17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 4) after 8 weeks of open-label escitalopram were randomized to 6 weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (20–50 mg/d) or placebo augmentation. The primary endpoint, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score change in escitalopram nonremitters (MADRS total score > 10) from week 8 (augmentation baseline) to week 14/end of study, was assessed using analysis of covariance, with last observation carried forward.

Results

For nonremitters (placebo, n = 64; lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, n = 65), the least squares (LS) mean (90% CI) treatment difference for MADRS total score reduction at week 14/end of study (-2.3 [-4.5 to -0.1]; P = 0.0902) met the prespecified criterion for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate superiority (adjusted effect size, -0.3); the number needed to treat for MADRS remission (MADRS total score ≤ 10) was 6.7. The LS mean treatment difference in remitters was not statistically significant (1.2 [-1.6 to 4.0]; P = 0.4726). Among randomized participants, 49.4% (42/85) receiving placebo and 60.2% (53/88) receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate had ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event, the most frequent with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate being dry mouth and headache (both 11.4%). Mean (SD) vital sign and electrocardiogram changes (placebo vs lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) were 0.5 (8.98) versus 2.3 (9.04) mm Hg (systolic blood pressure), -1.0 (7.19) versus 0.9 (6.61) mm Hg (diastolic blood pressure), -0.4 (7.39) versus 4.8 (8.64) beats per minute (heart rate), and -1.6 (11.23) versus -4.9 (11.84) milliseconds (Fridericia-adjusted QTc).

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation reduced depressive symptoms in participants with inadequate escitalopram response.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^06e706da]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Efficacy

The primary efficacy endpoint was change in MADRS total score from augmentation baseline at week 16 or early termination (ET), with assessments determined by central raters who were experienced clinicians and who were blinded to study visit and entry criteria. The central raters were trained on administration of the MADRS and were continuously calibrated to maintain the fidelity of ratings.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a validated measure of functional impairments in work, family, and social life, and the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), a validated measure of general health and quality of life. On the SDS (assessed at lead-in and augmentation baseline and weeks 10, 12, 14, and 16/ET in randomized participants), participants rated the impact of their illness on work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities using an 11-point scale (0 (no impairment) to 10 (most severe)); total scores range from 0–30. On EQ-5D-5L (assessed at lead-in and augmentation baseline and week 16/ET in randomized participants), participants designated their overall health status on a visual analog scale from 0 ("worst imaginable health status") to 100 ("best imaginable health status").

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^ac66566a]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study tested the efficacy and safety of a 12-week course of lisdexamfetamine in reducing methamphetamine use, an outcome which is associated with improvements in health and wellbeing, in people dependent on methamphetamine.

Design, Setting and Participants

This study was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in six specialist outpatient clinics in Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney, Australia (2018–2021). Participants were164 adults with methamphetamine dependence, reporting at least 14 use days out of the previous 28days (62% male, 38% female, < 1% other; mean age 39years).

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to a 15-week regimen of lisdexamfetamine (1-week induction to 250mg, 12-week maintenance regimen, 2-week reduction; n = 80) or matched placebo (n = 84), followed-up to Week 19.

Measurements

The primary efficacy measure was past 28-day methamphetamine use at Week 13. Safety was assessed by adverse event rates. Secondary measures included methamphetamine use during the 12-week treatment period and treatment satisfaction.

Findings

Nine randomized participants did not start treatment (five were allocated to lisdexamfetamine and four allocated to placebo) and were excluded from the analyses. Fifty-seven per cent of participants were retained on study medication to primary end-point. There was only weak evidence of a lisdexamfetamine benefit at 13weeks [adjusted difference in days of methamphetamine use = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.5 to 5.0; P = 0.49]. However, throughout the whole 12-week treatment maintenance phase, the lisdexamfetamine group had fewer days of methamphetamine use in total (difference = 8.8, 95% CI = 2.7–15.0; P = 0.005). The lisdexamfetamine group reported greater self-reported treatment effectiveness [odds ratio (OR) = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.67–5.02; P < 0.001] and treatment satisfaction (OR = 3.80, 95% CI = 1.93–7.47; P < 0.001). Adverse events with lisdexamfetamine included nausea. Serious adverse events occurred in four (5%) of participants who received lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine appears to reduce methamphetamine use over a 12-week treatment period, although there is only weak evidence that reduced use is maintained during the last 4weeks.

Absorption

Capsule formulation

Following single-dose oral administration of VYVANSE capsule (30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg) in patients ages 6 to 12 years with ADHD under fasted conditions, Tmaxof lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 3.5 hours post dose, respectively. Weight/Dose normalized AUC and Cmaxvalues were the same in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years as the adults following single doses of 30 mg to 70 mg VYVANSE capsule.

Effect of food on capsule formulation

Neither food (a high fat meal or yogurt) nor orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmaxof dextroamphetamine in healthy adults after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of VYVANSE capsules. Food prolongs Tmaxby approximately 1 hour (from 3.8 hours at fasted state to 4.7 hours after a high fat meal or to 4.2 hours with yogurt). After an 8-hour fast, the AUC for dextroamphetamine following oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in solution and as intact capsules were equivalent.

Chewable Tablet formulation

After a single dose administration of 60 mg VYVANSE chewable tablet in healthy subjects under fasted conditions, Tmaxof lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 4.4 hours post dose, respectively. Compared to 60 mg VYVANSE capsule, exposure (Cmaxand AUC) to lisdexamfetamine was about 15% lower. The exposure (Cmaxand AUCinf) of dextroamphetamine is similar between VYVANSE chewable tablet and VYVANSE capsule.

Effect of food on tablet formulation

Administration of 60 mg VYVANSE chewable tablet with food (a high-fat meal) decreases the exposure (Cmaxand AUCinf) of dextroamphetamine by about 5% to 7%, and prolongs mean Tmaxby approximately 1 hour (from 3.9 hours at fasted state to 4.9 hours).

Prior and concomitant medication use

Before the study, 52.7% (164/311) of the safety analysis set reported any use of antidepressant medications (placebo, 52.6% (41/78); 10 mg LDX, 53.2% (41/77); 30 mg LDX, 53.9% (41/76); 50 mg LDX, 50.0% (39/78); 70 mg LDX, 53.8% (43/80)). Antidepressant medications taken by ⩾5% of participants randomized to placebo or any LDX dose (placebo; LDX) were fluoxetine (15.4% (12/78); 15.8% (49/311)), sertraline (17.9% (14/78); 15.4% (48/311)), escitalopram (9.0% (7/78); 13.8% (43/311)), citalopram (11.5% (9/78); 11.9% (37/311)), venlafaxine (5.1% (4/78); 9.6% (30/311)), bupropion (9.0% (7/78); 8.0% (25/311)), paroxetine (3.8% (3/78); 7.4% (23/311)), or duloxetine (5.1% (4/78); 1.9% (6/311)).

During the study, most participants randomized to placebo or LDX reported concomitant medication use (placebo, 59.0% (46/78); 10 mg LDX, 64.9% (50/77); 30 mg LDX, 56.6% (43/76); 50 mg LDX, 47.4% (37/78); 70 mg LDX, 63.8% (51/80)).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^1bbb2791]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although medications indicated for major depressive disorder (MDD), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), effectively reduce the depressive symptoms of MDD, more than 60% of individuals with MDD do not experience full remission with monotherapy or second-step augmentation, which highlights the need for novel treatment approaches. For instance, in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, remission rates with citalopram monotherapy were only 27.5% (as measured by total scores ≤ 7 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and 32.9% (as measured by total scores ≤ 5 on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report). In addition, only 29.7–39.0% of those receiving second-step augmentation with sustained-release bupropion or with buspirone achieved remission.

### Eosinophilic hepatitis in an adolescent during lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment for ADHD [^0b7979bd]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

We describe here the case of an adolescent who developed eosinophilic hepatitis during treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse [Shire US Inc, Wayne, PA]). A 14-year-old boy presented to his primary care provider with abdominal pain and worsening jaundice. A diagnosis of hepatitis was made with biochemical markers, but evaluation failed to provide an etiology. Worsening hepatitis prompted hospitalization and initiation of steroids for presumed autoimmune hepatitis. A subsequent liver biopsy showed evidence of eosinophilic hepatitis. Known causes of eosinophilic hepatitis were ruled out, and a presumptive diagnosis of reaction to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was made. Discontinuation of the medication led to resolution of the hepatitis and normalization of the liver biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hepatic injury attributed to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.

As the published LDX studies of augmentation therapy for MDD used flexible-dose designs, analyses of dose-response relationships for efficacy, safety, or tolerability were not performed. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy dose-response relationship of LDX when used as augmentation therapy for MDD in individuals who exhibited inadequate MADRS total score responses to an eight-week course of antidepressant monotherapy. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of LDX dose-response relationships on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse, and the assessment of the safety and tolerability of LDX based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), responses to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.

3.2.1.1.1 1‐Week binge eating response (percentage reductions in binge‐eating episodes/week)

The 1‐week binge eating response distributions differed between LDX and placebo in both studies from Week 1 through Week 12 (all χ² statistics ≥ 16.66 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests; degrees of freedom = 1; all nominal p values < .001; all Cramer's Vs ≥ .28) and at Week 12/ET (both χ² statistics ≥ 43.82 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests; degrees of freedom = 1; both nominal p values < .001; both Cramer's Vs ≥ .40). The percentages of participants exhibiting binge eating episode reductions of 100% and 99% to 75% in the last 7 days were numerically greater with LDX than placebo from Week 1 to Week 12 in both studies (Figure 3 A, B).

3.2.2 Body weight

Mean ± SD body weight decreased with LDX but not placebo over the course of both studies (Figure 4 A, B), resulting in larger mean ± SD percentage decreases in body weight from baseline with LDX than placebo (Figure 4 C, D). In both studies, the LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences for the percentage body weight change from baseline favored LDX over placebo from Week 1 through Week 10 (all nominal p values < .001; all ES ≥ .56) and at Week 12 (both p values < .001; both ES ≥ 1.22) (Supporting Information Table 2).

### Prediction of placebo response in 2 clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of ADHD [^8b20b396]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To search for predictors of placebo response in clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of DSM-IV-TR-defined attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.

Method

We used data from 2 clinical trials: (1) a 4-week, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study of children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD (n = 290) and (2) a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forced-dose titration study in adult subjects, aged 18–55 years with ADHD (n = 420). Response and remission were defined using the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.

Results

Symptom remission was inversely correlated with baseline severity in both children and adults (P < .001), with less robust effects seen for response. The time to response and remission was delayed in adult subjects prescribed placebo versus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, while response time in children was also significantly slower with placebo versus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (P < .01). We found little evidence that demographic factors, prior pharmacotherapy, the emergence of adverse events during the trial, or changes in ADHD symptoms from the screening to baseline assessments predicted placebo response. Certain comorbid medical symptoms reduced the response and remission rates to placebo in children (P < .001) and adults (P < .001).

Conclusions

In both children and adults, baseline symptom severity was the most consistent predictor of remission with placebo while the temporal profile of response reliably differentiated placebo from medication responders. Placebo effects are most likely to be minimized in shorter trials enrolling more severely impaired subjects. The impact of medical and psychiatric comorbidities on placebo response merits further investigation.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate improves processing speed and memory in cognitively impaired MS patients: a phase II study [^0bb92b0f]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes cognitive impairment including slowed processing speed and problems with learning and memory. Stimulants are attractive candidates for improving mental speed but carry risk of addiction and other adverse behavioral effects. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a D-amphetamine prodrug currently approved for attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder with the potential to be better tolerated due to its prolonged clinical effect. This phase II placebo-controlled, double-blind study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of LDX in cognitively impaired MS patients. Subjects were patients with clinically definite MS, aged 18–56 years, and impaired on either of two primary outcomes: the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) or the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). Both SDMT and PASAT are measures of cognitive processing speed. Of 174 MS patients screened, 63 were randomized to 30 mg of LDX or placebo in a 2:1 fashion; the dose was increased as tolerated to 70 mg over 4 weeks and then maintained for another 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMTR), the California Verbal Learning Test 2nd edition (CVLT2), both measures of episodic memory, and the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for adults (BRIEF-A), a self-report measure of executive function. Fatigue and depression were also evaluated. There was significant improvement in the SDMT score (+4.6 vs. +1.3) and CVLT2 score (+4.7 vs. -0.9) in the LDX group compared with the placebo group among the 49 completers. There was no change on the other outcomes. A high proportion of both LDX-treated and placebo-treated subjects reported adverse events (73.5% vs. 68.4%). However, there were no serious adverse events noted in the study. These preliminary data indicate that LDX has the potential to be an efficacious treatment for MS patients with cognitive impairment.

### Bilateral acute angle closure in a pediatric patient taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (vyvanse) [^1928defb]. Journal of Glaucoma (2021). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is commonly treated with amphetamines as first line therapy. Rare case reports have shown amphetamines are associated with open angle glaucoma. We report a rare case of a 14-year-old male who presented with bilateral acute angle closure presumed to be related to his use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse). The patient's medication was discontinued which resulted in complete resolution of angle closure.

What are lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules?

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant prescription medicine used for the treatment of:

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules may help increase attention and decrease impulsiveness and hyperactivity in people with ADHD.
Moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules may help reduce the number of binge eating days in people with BED.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and BED is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate have been conducted in healthy adult (capsule and chewable tablet formulations) and pediatric (6 to 12 years) patients with ADHD (capsule formulation). After single dose administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, pharmacokinetics of dextroamphetamine was found to be linear between 30 mg and 70 mg in a pediatric study (6 to 12 years), and between 50 mg and 250 mg in an adult study. Dextroamphetamine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults exhibited low inter-subject (< 25%) and intra-subject (< 8%) variability. There is no accumulation of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine at steady state in healthy adults.

Absorption

Capsule formulation

Following single-dose oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsule (30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg) in patients ages 6 to 12 years with ADHD under fasted conditions, Tmax of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 3.5 hours post dose, respectively. Weight/Dose normalized AUC and Cmaxvalues were the same in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years as the adults following single doses of 30 mg to 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsule.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^a468b6a1]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

There were five serious adverse events in the lisdexamfetamine group. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; nausea was more frequent in the lisdexamfetamine group. Post‐hoc analysis detected transient mild (< 4 mmHg) increases in diastolic blood pressure at two time‐points. Future investigation of lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily requires continued cautious cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric monitoring, given the risks of adverse outcomes associated with methamphetamine use and the known adverse event profile of prescribed psychostimulants.

The proportion of urinalyses positive for methamphetamine is the most commonly reported outcome measure in RCTs of psychostimulants for amphetamine type stimulant use disorder. We selected a primary outcome of difference in days of use. Self‐report is a sufficiently valid measure, and the combination of urine toxicology and self‐report enhances the validity of self‐reported substance use. The study design precluded verification of self‐reported use days by weekly urinalysis results due to differences in the periodicity in the two data sources. Reduced frequency of use is a valid outcome measure associated with improved drug use, health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on clinically meaningful reduction in use. There is, however, growing recognition of participant‐reported outcome measures as alternative end‐points. We found positive findings regarding self‐reported treatment effectiveness and drug effect. This aspect of the treatment might be important for treatment uptake and underscores an imperative for stronger efficacy data.

Lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily, relative to placebo, is associated with reduction of use over a 12‐week treatment period but not the last 4 weeks of treatment among people with methamphetamine dependence using on at least 14 of the previous 28 days. Lisdexamfetamine was associated with participant‐reported treatment effectiveness and overall satisfaction. The place of lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence remains inconclusive.
