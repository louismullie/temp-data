## Question

Does a wound with 100 eschar require nursing care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a wound described as "100% eschar" requires nursing care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "100% eschar" actually means in clinical terms. Then, I should verify when eschar mandates debridement versus when it should be left intact. Next, I will review the scope and responsibilities of nursing care in eschar management. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, such as heel pressure injuries and burns, and synthesize a clear conclusion with practical recommendations [^111VrCtV].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology before jumping to recommendations. "Eschar" refers to devitalized, usually dry, leathery necrotic tissue that can overlie wounds of multiple etiologies, including pressure injuries, ischemic/diabetic foot ulcers, traumatic wounds, and burns; saying "100% eschar" implies the entire wound bed is covered by necrotic eschar, which is clinically significant because it impedes epithelialization, can harbor bacteria, and masks underlying tissue status [^116Yd9r4] [^112dJvcZ] [^114eJZY4].

> I should confirm whether such a presentation requires nursing care per se. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the mere presence of eschar does not dictate a single intervention pathway, but it absolutely necessitates skilled assessment, ongoing monitoring, documentation, dressing selection, and escalation plans because eschar signals nonviable tissue and risks of infection or progression, and optimal outcomes depend on organized, multidisciplinary wound services in which nursing is central [^112dJvcZ] [^112g1Fh3] [^115sLdSF].

> My first instinct is to say "all eschar must be debrided", but wait, I need to check guideline exceptions and indications. Debridement is indicated when necrotic tissue is present, with urgent sharp debridement for advancing cellulitis or sepsis; however, the WHS guideline explicitly recommends avoiding debridement of stable, dry heel pressure injuries with eschar in the absence of edema, erythema, or drainage, so I must not overgeneralize debridement to every eschar-covered wound [^112dJvcZ] [^116jbSSp] [^1112dnsB].

> Next, I should review what nursing care entails here. Let me think about core tasks: nurses document wound size, location, eschar characteristics, exudate, odor, undermining, and infection signs; they cleanse appropriately, select dressings to maintain a balanced moist environment while protecting periwound skin and managing exudate, and they monitor closely for deterioration requiring escalation; this aligns with WHS dressing guidance and longstanding wound assessment standards and reflects the defined specialty role of wound-care nursing [^112dJvcZ] [^115kUNn3] [^114jiZMM].

> I need to ensure I cover debridement modalities and what falls within nursing-managed care. Maintenance debridement can be achieved by autolytic and enzymatic methods when appropriate, with enzymatic agents such as collagenase used per labeling and local protocols; selection of method depends on wound characteristics, presence of infection, perfusion, pain, and provider scope, and evidence syntheses highlight that while debridement is standard, comparative effectiveness among methods varies and must be individualized with serial reassessment [^116jbSSp] [^113AcHuz] [^113yHBTv].

> But wait, what if the "100% eschar" is from a thermal burn rather than a pressure or ischemic wound? I should double-check burn-specific principles. For deeper burns, early eschar removal is generally pursued to reduce complications, and enzymatic debridement options like bromelain-based agents are FDA-indicated for eschar removal in deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns under defined conditions; however, indications and limitations must be respected, and nursing remains pivotal for dressing technique, infection prevention, and perioperative support in burn care pathways [^117PC9Jw] [^116CM1h7] [^112XFwWY].

> Let me reconsider the important exception, because this is where errors often occur. Even when I should not debride a stable, dry heel eschar, I still need active nursing care: daily inspection for conversion to wet or infected eschar, protective dressings to keep the eschar dry and the periwound intact, strict off-loading and pressure redistribution, and nutritional assessment and optimization to support healing and prevent deterioration, with prompt escalation if any signs of inflammation, drainage, or instability emerge [^1112dnsB] [^112dJvcZ] [^115kUNn3].

> I should also verify systems-level considerations that justify nursing involvement. Complex wounds carry substantial morbidity and cost, and outcomes are sensitive to how care is organized; structured nursing assessment, consistent follow-up, and multidisciplinary coordination improve safety and reduce preventable complications, reinforcing that eschar-laden wounds are never "no-care" situations even when the immediate plan is conservative [^115hHUk2] [^112g1Fh3] [^115sLdSF].

> In conclusion, I need to be precise. Yes, a wound with 100% eschar requires nursing care, but the care plan depends on the wound's etiology and stability: if the eschar is unstable, wet, painful, malodorous, or associated with infection or systemic signs, nursing should coordinate timely debridement, infection control, appropriate dressings, off-loading, and escalation; if the eschar is a stable, dry heel cap without inflammation, nursing should avoid debridement, maintain protection, monitor closely for change, and manage pressure and nutrition, with ongoing reassessment guiding any shift in strategy [^116jbSSp] [^1112dnsB] [^112dJvcZ].

Yes, **nursing care is required** for wounds with 100% eschar. Eschar is nonviable tissue that impedes healing [^113yHBTv] and increases infection risk [^112dJvcZ]; therefore, nurses must provide **regular assessment and monitoring** to detect infection or deterioration early [^117BMhFV] [^116Yd9r4]. Nursing care includes **infection prevention and control**, pain management, and patient education [^114jiZMM]; nurses also coordinate debridement [^116jbSSp] and advanced therapies as indicated [^117GVaNA] [^112dJvcZ] [^114eJZY4]. Even when debridement is deferred (e.g. stable heel eschar), ongoing nursing care is essential to monitor for complications and maintain wound stability [^1112dnsB].

---

## Clinical significance of 100% eschar

Eschar is a firm, leathery, black or brown crust of necrotic tissue that forms after full-thickness injury [^114eJZY4]; it is avascular and insensate, acts as a barrier to healing, and may harbor bacteria, increasing infection risk [^115zdMby] [^112dJvcZ]. Eschar can cause **delayed healing** [^113yHBTv] and complications such as infection, sepsis, and tissue loss [^112dJvcZ].

---

## Nursing care requirements for 100% eschar wounds

Nursing care is **essential** for 100% eschar wounds to prevent complications, promote healing, and support patient comfort and education. Key nursing interventions are outlined below.

---

### Assessment and monitoring

Regular assessment includes **monitoring wound size, depth, exudate, odor, and signs of infection** such as erythema, warmth, swelling, and purulent discharge [^112dJvcZ]. Systemic monitoring involves tracking **temperature, heart rate, and other vital signs** to detect systemic infection or sepsis early [^112QhB3e]. Documentation should capture **wound characteristics, interventions, and patient responses** to guide care and detect changes [^114AvrnC].

---

### Infection prevention and control

Infection prevention and control emphasizes strict **aseptic technique** during dressing changes and wound care, along with rigorous **hand hygiene** [^112g1Fh3] [^115fDUKK]. Antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver-containing) are applied to reduce **bacterial load and prevent infection** [^115kUNn3] [^115zdMby].

---

### Pain management

Pain assessment should be performed regularly, with **appropriate analgesia before dressing changes** and procedures, and non-pharmacologic measures such as relaxation, distraction, and positioning should be used to reduce pain and anxiety [^114wxQhR] [^114AvrnC].

---

### Debridement and wound bed preparation

Debridement coordination includes arranging **surgical, enzymatic, or autolytic debridement** to remove necrotic tissue and prepare the wound bed [^112dJvcZ] [^116jbSSp] [^113AcHuz], along with meticulous **post-debridement care** to prevent infection and promote healing [^113yHBTv] [^111sgJCL].

---

### Moisture balance and dressing selection

Moisture management aims to **maintain a moist wound environment** to promote autolytic debridement and healing, while **appropriate dressings** are selected to manage exudate, protect periwound skin, and minimize friction and shear [^114AvrnC] [^115kUNn3] [^114Unwp5].

---

### Patient and family education

Education should cover **wound care and signs of infection**, with psychosocial support to address anxiety, depression, and body image concerns [^114jiZMM] [^111iRCdC].

---

## Risks and complications of inadequate nursing care

Inadequate nursing care for **100% eschar wounds** can lead to significant complications, including:

- **Infection**: Increased risk of local and systemic infection, including sepsis [^115zdMby].

- **Delayed healing**: Prolonged healing due to persistent necrotic tissue and bacterial colonization [^113yHBTv].

- **Tissue loss**: Increased risk of tissue necrosis and loss, potentially requiring surgical intervention or amputation [^115ZPoUQ].

- **Pain and discomfort**: Inadequate pain management leading to patient distress and reduced quality of life [^114wxQhR].

- **Psychosocial impact**: Increased anxiety, depression, and reduced patient satisfaction [^115hHUk2].

---

## Evidence-based guidelines and best practices

Several **evidence-based guidelines** emphasize the importance of nursing care in managing eschar wounds:

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend initial and maintenance debridement to remove necrotic tissue and reduce bacterial burden [^116jbSSp].

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend selecting dressings that maintain a moist environment, manage exudate, and protect periwound skin [^115kUNn3].

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend not debriding stable heel ulcers with dry eschar unless signs of infection or inflammation are present [^1112dnsB].

---

## Multidisciplinary collaboration

Effective management of 100% eschar wounds **requires collaboration** among healthcare professionals, including [^117BMhFV]:

- **Physicians**: Provide medical oversight, prescribe antibiotics, and perform surgical interventions.

- **Wound care specialists**: Offer specialized expertise in wound assessment, debridement, and advanced therapies [^115sLdSF].

- **Physical therapists**: Assist with mobility, positioning, and rehabilitation.

- **Dietitians**: Provide nutritional support to promote wound healing [^115ZPoUQ].

---

## Conclusion

Nursing care is **essential** for wounds with 100% eschar, providing assessment, infection prevention, pain management, debridement coordination, moisture management, and education [^116jbSSp]. Inadequate nursing care increases the risk of infection, delayed healing, tissue loss, and psychosocial distress. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines and multidisciplinary collaboration are critical for optimal outcomes [^112g1Fh3].

### Pressure ulcers: Prevention, evaluation, and management [^112dJvcZ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, resulting from unrelieved pressure. Predisposing factors are classified as intrinsic (e.g. limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g. pressure, friction, shear, moisture). Prevention includes identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures, such as following a patient repositioning schedule; keeping the head of the bed at the lowest safe elevation to prevent shear; using pressure-reducing surfaces; and assessing nutrition and providing supplementation, if needed.

When an ulcer occurs, documentation of each ulcer (i.e. size, location, eschar and granulation tissue, exudate, odor, sinus tracts, undermining, and infection) and appropriate staging (I through IV) are essential to the wound assessment. Treatment involves management of local and distant infections, removal of necrotic tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery.

Debridement is indicated when necrotic tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing cellulitis or sepsis occurs. Mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic debridement methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline and appropriate dressings, is a mainstay of treatment for clean ulcers and after debridement. Bacterial load can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with infections.

### The rash that leads to eschar formation [^114eJZY4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes. This contribution is intended to help dermatologists identify and manage these various dermatologic conditions, as well as provide an algorithm that can be utilized when approaching a patient presenting with an eschar.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^116Yd9r4]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Nonviable necrotic eschar impedes wound healing and can ultimately lead to the failure of soft tissue coverage of a lower extremity amputation stump. When present, this eschar can create a mechanical blockade to wound epithelialization, prolong the inflammatory component of the wound-healing mechanism, and serve as a nidus for soft tissue infection. For these reasons, surgeons classically opt for sharp debridement of eschar and revision of a wound closure to include skin grafts or vascularized flaps. Efforts to identify less invasive strategies for managing this complication have yielded a number of alternative debridement techniques. In this report, we present a case study wherein honey was utilized in combination with burdock leaves to promote successful healing of a traumatic transfemoral amputation surgical wound complicated by tissue necrosis, without the need for further surgical revision in a patient opposed to additional surgery.

### Guidelines for the management of partial-thickness burns in a general hospital or community setting — recommendations of a European working party [^1157tKA4]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Most partial-thickness burns in Europe and the United States are managed by non-burns specialists who do not treat burns on a regular basis. To achieve better patient outcomes, partial-thickness burns should be properly managed in non-specialist centers and referred to burn units when appropriate. Although some guidelines have been published to assist non-specialists, few have attempted to provide comprehensive step-by-step guidance emphasizing wound-healing principles.

A working party of European burn specialists devised a new treatment algorithm to provide clear guidance on the management of partial-thickness burns in the general hospital and community setting. Four areas were identified for improvement: diagnosis and referral, wound preparation, wound covering, and post-wound care. The guidelines take into account the role of wound dressings, infection, and general patient well-being, bearing in mind the different working environments that occur across Europe. They are aimed at improving the overall outcome for community-treated patients within the expanding European Union and reducing the number of preventable late referrals to specialists.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^1175166m]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

This patient-selected conservative honey and burdock treatment strategy was highly effective for this individual, both clinically and for his goal to avoid further surgical management if possible. By postoperative week 7, the eschar had nearly completely lysed away and was sharply excised through several intact fibrous adhesions to the underlying granulating bed as a single piece of tissue. The honey and burdock treatment was continued by the patient after eschar debridement for a total of 14 weeks.

Of note, during this period the patient developed a transient folliculitis, suspected to be due to moisture accumulation and sweat. The patient was advised to minimize the cotton gauze wrapping to allow greater permeability, and the rash spontaneously resolved without antibiotics within 3–4 days. By week 10, the underlying wound bed was re-epithelialized with primarily healthy tissue, except for mild posteromedial erythema and the presence of a benign exudative process with minimal serous fluid, along with several superficial erosions indicative of the final stages of healing. These lesions were treated by superficial debridement in the clinic by the treating surgeon. At no point during follow-up was there concern for infection.

By week 14, his stump had matured and was in acceptable form to bear weight through an above-the-knee prosthetic device, as evidenced by viable and healed anterior/distal flaps and posterior soft tissue flaps.

### Wound care nursing: Professional issues and opportunities [^114jiZMM]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

As the field of wound care advances and seeks validity as a distinctive healthcare specialty, it becomes imperative to define practice competencies for all related professionals in the arena. The myriad of nurses practicing wound care in settings across the continuum should be recognized for their unique contributions to the wound care team. Furthermore, the hierarchy of wound care nursing, with varying levels of licensure, certification, and scope of practice, can be clarified to delineate leadership and reimbursement issues to meet healthcare challenges. A review of the role of nursing in wound care from a historical and evolutionary perspective helps to characterize the trend toward advanced practice nursing in the wound care specialty.

### "Gearing to a time table"; the evolution of earlier surgical eschar excision in massive burns by British burns surgeons at the battles of Cassino, 1944: an example of real-time audit [^1126xZjt]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of burns care delivery is difficult to measure within a realistic workload and resource framework. In addition, workers must develop new tools for this purpose. We describe a historical example from World War II, detailing the evolution of burns excision in the context of thorough outcome assessment during the allied advance from North Africa up the Italian Peninsular, including the battles of Cassino from 1942 to 1945. Patrick Clarkson and Rex Lawrie, working as plastic surgeons in a small forward Maxillofacial Unit, were able to fully assess the management and outcomes of 800 burnt servicemen. Of these, 192 burns were full thickness and required grafting.

Prospective data revealed that burns surgically excised and grafted between 12 and 18 days healed more quickly than those managed by conservative dressings until the eschar sloughed off, followed by grafting. Burns managed by excision and grafting in less than 5 weeks post-injury (n = 86) healed 8.6 days faster than those grafted later (n = 106). This difference was even more pronounced in massive burns covering over 1000 cm², with those grafted within 5 weeks (n = 17) healing 13 days faster than the delayed group (n = 27). Their transparent and simple method of prospective audit is described.

### Nexobrid [^112XFwWY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Nexobrid for the eschar removal of deep partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness (FT) thermal burns has been investigated in two trials.

- **Adults**: Nexobrid was investigated in the DETECT randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, three-arm trial, comparing Nexobrid, standard of care (SOC), and gel vehicle treatment in subjects with DPT and/or FT thermal burns of 3–30% BSA (Study 1, NCT02148705). SOC included both surgical and non-surgical methods for eschar removal per the investigators' discretion. Subjects on the Nexobrid and gel vehicle arms who had eschar remaining following the topical treatment period were treated with SOC. Nexobrid was compared to gel vehicle for the incidence of ≥ 95% eschar removal at the end of the topical treatment period. Nexobrid was also compared with SOC for the incidence of surgical eschar removal (tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet and/or dermabrasion excision) and time to eschar removal.

A total of 175 subjects were randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio (Nexobrid: SOC: gel vehicle) and 169 subjects were treated. The mean age was 41 years, 70% of subjects were male and 30% were female. The racial demographics were: 81% White, 14% Black or African American, 5% other races, and 1% Asian. Additionally, 17% of subjects were Hispanic or Latino. Subjects had one or more target wounds (TWs) to be treated for eschar removal. The mean percentage BSA of all TWs per subject was 6.1%, and the majority of subjects (82%) had one to two TWs.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^112nU8nM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Approximately 71% (42 out of 59) of the cost-effectiveness analyses had a score of 8 or higher out of a total possible score of 10. Using the Drummond 10-item tool, the key methodological shortcoming across the cost-effectiveness analyses was that only 51% (30 out of 59) had established the 'effectiveness' of the intervention using data from efficacy studies (i.e. systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, or observational studies) that had sufficiently large sample sizes according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for establishing efficacy.

Consistent methodological strengths across the cost-effectiveness analyses included a clear research question, costs and consequences measured in appropriate physical units, credibly valued costs and consequences, and discounted costs when applicable.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^115hHUk2]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). High credibility.

Complex wounds that fail to progress through expected healing phases in a timely manner are classified as hard-to-heal or chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life, and considerable economic and societal burden, both within the United States and globally. Recent US estimates suggest that Medicare spending alone on all wound types ranges between USD 28–97 billion annually. Data from other countries further support the considerable costs of chronic wounds. Canadian expenditure on diabetic foot ulcers alone is estimated at $509 million annually, while chronic wound expenditure in the United Kingdom is estimated to be €4.5–5.3 billion.

A 2017 systematic review of 36 international cost-of-illness studies, covering payer, hospital, patient, and societal perspectives, estimated mean 1-year costs to the public payer ranging from $11,000 (USD) per chronic venous leg ulcer up to $44,200 for every diabetic foot ulcer. Projections suggest that these costs will continue to increase in the future.

Despite chronic wounds representing a major public health challenge, cost estimates likely underestimate the true burden of disease due to underreporting and a lack of quality prevalence studies, particularly at the global level. Critically, the timely identification, intervention, and personalized management of complex chronic wounds are further limited by a lack of reliable, validated risk prediction and prognostic tools. This limitation is, in part, due to the complexity and range of comorbidities involved.

### WHS guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers-2023 update [^116jbSSp]. Wound Repair and Regeneration (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pressure ulcers, specifically in relation to debridement, the WHS 2024 guidelines recommend performing initial debridement using one or more methods such as sharp, mechanical, enzymatic, ultrasonic, or autolytic techniques to remove obvious necrotic or devitalized tissue, excessive bacterial burden, and the cellular burden of dead and senescent cells. It is advised to perform maintenance debridement to preserve the appearance and readiness of the wound bed for healing.

### Reducing risk in emergency department wound management [^111iRCdC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Although substantial dollar amounts are not involved, wound-care litigation constitutes a significant number of lawsuits against emergency medicine physicians. This results in an increased drain on the physician's time and exposes the physician to all the psychosocial effects involved in the medicolegal process. The procedures outlined in this article — including paying attention to wound-care principles, involving patients in the medical decision-making process, and ensuring appropriate medical follow-up — can, it is hoped, reduce the incidence of medical claims.

### A practical guide to wound healing [^114AvrnC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

After reading this article, the participant should be able to:

- **Understand the basic stages of wound healing**: Grasp the fundamental processes involved in each stage of wound healing.
- **Apply techniques to achieve wound closure**: Implement various methods to effectively close wounds.
- **Manage patients with simple and complex wounds effectively**: Develop strategies to handle both simple and complex wound cases.

While wound healing can still be divided into stages, numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors must be considered as well if clinical success is to be reliably achieved. While a routine wound may require nothing more than a simple dressing, more complex and challenging wounds may benefit from advanced therapies such as growth factor applications, specialized dressings, or adjunctive therapy. This article provides a concise summary of the advances in the basic and clinical science of wound healing.

### Comparative efficacy of tranexamic acid versus placebo on hemostatic outcomes after the surgical debridement of burn patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial [^116EhPbC]. Burns (2025). High credibility.

Burns are traumatic events that can affect multiple systems beyond the skin. The rapid removal of the burn eschar is a key step in the effective treatment of severe burns, and surgical debridement is currently the standard of care for eschar removal in burn patients. However, surgical debridement is highly hemorrhagic. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic lysine analog, may reduce bleeding.

- **Methods**: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of preoperative tranexamic acid administration in the early surgical debridement of severe burns. The study was conducted from January to December 2022.

- **Results**: The general characteristics of patients and mechanism of injury were similar between the treated and control groups. The burned body surface area was 26.46% ± 5.45% in the study group and 27.10% ± 4.45% in the control group (p = 0.83). Intraoperative hemorrhage volume was larger in the control group (299.3 ± 88.9 ml) than in the study group (117 ± 51.7 ml) (p = 0.0001). The decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were larger in the control group (2.1 ± 1.4 g/dl and 5.7% ± 4.6%) than in the study group (0.85 ± 0.4 g/dl and 2.1% ± 0.5%) (p = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). Six patients in the control group but no patients in the study group required blood transfusion (p = 0.002). No thromboembolic events were observed.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that tranexamic acid was effective at reducing intraoperative hemorrhage volume and the need for transfusion in burn surgery patients. It was shown to be safe for use in these patients.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^113jBZdN]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, specifically with respect to prehospital care, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend identifying the agent. If a chemical agent is present, specific protocols should be followed, and all contaminated clothing and materials should be removed and disposed of appropriately. The guidelines also advise copious lavage with water for up to 45 minutes as first aid for chemical injuries.

### Enzymatic debridement in scalds is not as effective as in flame burns regarding additional eschar excision: A retrospective matched-control study [^115msKCB]. Burns (2022). Low credibility.

Enzymatic debridement of burn eschar has become an accepted and widely used technique for burn wound treatment over the last few years. However, this practice is not exempt from failure, and recent experimental studies indicate that it may not be as efficient in scalds as in flame burns.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit between June 2017 and February 2021, who received enzymatic debridement within the first 72 hours after scald and flame burns, were included. Patients with scald burns were matched regarding age, sex, and percent total body surface area (%TBSA) burned in a 1:2 ratio with patients presenting with flame burns.

- **Results**: Eighteen patients with scald burns were matched with 36 with flame burns. After matching, both groups were similar in age (flame burns 44.5 ± 21.1 years vs. scald 41.8 ± 22.6 years, p = 0.666) and %TBSA burned (11.0 ± 8.2% vs. 10.6 ± 9.6%, p = 0.851). Patients with scald burns significantly more often underwent further surgical eschar excision compared to controls (scald 16 (88.9%) vs. flame 19 (52.8%), p = 0.016). The length of stay per %TBSA was significantly longer in scald burns (scald 7.8 ± 9.2 days vs. flame 3.7 ± 3.8, p = 0.013).

- **Conclusion**: This study indicates that enzymatic debridement may not be as effective in scalds as in flame burns. Patients with scalds who underwent enzymatic debridement more frequently required additional surgical intervention, and the size of the transplanted area was larger compared to controls. Moreover, those patients had a longer length of stay.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^112G19g1]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Objective: Nonviable necrotic eschar presents a barrier to wound healing and may ultimately result in failure of soft tissue coverage in traumatic or high-risk wounds. Topical therapeutic agents offer a less invasive management alternative to surgical debridement of eschar.

Approach: This report discusses the case of a 40-year-old male with a traumatic right lower extremity amputation complicated by surgical incision ischemic eschar formation. A honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings was employed to noninvasively manage the eschar that extended over the incision site. Images were collected over a 5-month follow-up period.

Results: The 5-month follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of the eschar and re-epithelialization of the skin in the affected area.

Innovation: The use of honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings appears promising for enhancing healing outcomes in traumatic wounds that develop nonviable eschar. Surgical debridement of an amputation stump with a large ischemic eschar was avoided through this noninvasive treatment.

### Current state of science in negative pressure wound therapy [^117GVaNA]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). High credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was introduced in clinical practice in the early 1990s and has become widely used to manage wounds in both inpatient and outpatient care.

- **Recent advances**: Evolutions of the initial technology include the development of new dressing interfaces and tubing configurations, the addition of instillation to improve cleansing, and various design changes to enhance portability. Research has been conducted to understand mechanisms of action and to demonstrate clinical utility. NPWT has been suggested as a valuable approach for various complex and/or non-healing wounds, and recommendations for its use have emerged in several guidelines.

- **Future directions**: The evidence, composed of a combination of randomized controlled trials, case series, cohort studies, real-world evidence, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinion, is heterogeneous and still building. This special mini forum issue presents the state of the science for NPWT and new studies, providing insights into some innovative ways clinicians use this technology to help improve outcomes in a variety of wound types.

### Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers [^112g1Fh3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Pressure ulcers, which are a localized injury to the skin, or underlying tissue, or both, occur when people are unable to reposition themselves to relieve pressure on bony prominences. Pressure ulcers are often difficult to heal, painful, expensive to manage, and have a negative impact on quality of life. While individual patient safety and quality care stem largely from direct healthcare practitioner-patient interactions, each practitioner-patient wound-care contact may be constrained or enhanced by healthcare organization of services. Research is needed to demonstrate clearly the effect of different provider-oriented approaches to pressure ulcer prevention and treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different provider-oriented interventions targeted at the organization of health services on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.

- **Search methods**: In April 2018, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series.

### Investigation of a prolonged group A Streptococcal outbreak among residents of a skilled nursing facility, Georgia, 2009–2012 [^115fDUKK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an important bacterial cause of life-threatening illness among the elderly. Public health officials investigated a protracted GAS outbreak in a skilled nursing facility in Georgia, housing patients requiring 24-hour nursing or rehabilitation, to prevent additional cases.

- **Methods**: We defined a case as illness in a skilled nursing facility resident with onset after January 2009 with GAS isolated from a usually sterile (invasive) or nonsterile (noninvasive) site. Cases were considered "recurrent" if more than one month elapsed between episodes. We evaluated infection control practices, performed a GAS carriage study, emm-typed available GAS isolates, and conducted a case-control study of risk factors for infection.

- **Results**: Three investigations, spanning 36 months, identified 19 residents with a total of 24 GAS infections: 15 invasive (3 recurrent) and 9 noninvasive (2 recurrent) episodes. All invasive cases required hospitalization; 4 patients died. Seven residents were GAS carriers. All invasive cases and resident carrier isolates were type emm 11.0. We observed hand hygiene lapses, inadequate infection documentation, and more frequent wound care staff turnover on Wing A versus Wing B. Risk factors associated with infection in multivariable analysis included living on Wing A (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.9–16.4) and having an indwelling line (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.2–36.4). Cases ceased following facility-wide chemoprophylaxis in July 2012.

- **Conclusions**: Staff turnover, compromised skin integrity in residents, a suboptimal infection…

### Approach to the atypical wound [^114bnXEt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of atypical wounds can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges; however, as the prevalence of atypical wounds grows worldwide, prompt and accurate management is increasingly an essential skill for dermatologists. Addressing the underlying cause of an atypical wound is critical for successful outcomes. An integrated approach with a focus on pain management and patient engagement is recommended to facilitate enduring wound closure. Advances in treatment, in addition to further research and clinical training, are necessary to address the expanding burden of atypical wounds.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^111wqU6L]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Extremity trauma presents a challenging clinical problem for surgeons, often predisposing trauma survivors to substantial morbidity and loss of function. In the acute setting, patients may experience active hemorrhage through severely mangled extremities, and orthopedic injuries that are too severe for successful limb salvage. When hemorrhage cannot be controlled through conservative measures, amputation may be necessary, with an emphasis on preserving as much of the native limb as possible. In such cases, amputation allows for hemostasis, enabling the focus to shift to resuscitating the patient and addressing other associated, yet less severe, injuries.

Once amputation is performed, various challenges must be addressed. Open fractures and contamination from the initial injury increase the risk of infection. Moreover, the full extent of soft tissue injury is often difficult to ascertain immediately after surgery. In the days and weeks following amputation, barriers to successful healing, such as inadequate soft tissue flap perfusion, poor host nutrition, and soft tissue infection, frequently become apparent.

When wound healing complications arise, the surgeon's options for improving clinical outcomes can be constrained by patient preferences or the wound's intrinsic characteristics. Surgical debridement, alongside wound bed preparation and potential split thickness skin grafting, may offer solutions, though they are contingent on the specific clinical scenario and patient condition.

### Principles of wound care in patients with epidermolysis bullosa [^114Unwp5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Epidermolysis bullosa comprises a series of hereditary skin fragility disorders characterized by blister formation in response to minor friction or trauma. Acute and chronic wounds are part of the daily life of many epidermolysis bullosa patients. To offer proper care, health care providers need to understand the wound healing process, recognize the different types of wounds these patients may present, and be able to select among a wide variety of wound care products to optimize healing.

### Wound healing — a practical algorithm [^115ZPoUQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The decision-making process involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds is complex but hinges on certain simple principles. The first is to agree on the actual aim of management with the patient or their representative, as healing of an open wound may only be a part of this. The agreed plan should be discussed and reviewed if the wound is unresponsive to intervention. Management otherwise depends on regular debridement and cleansing, treatment of any infection, consideration of revascularization, and protection of the wound by dressings and off-loading.

The evidence to justify the use of advanced wound care therapies is not strong, and outcomes depend more on the organization of the wound care process than on the choice of a particular wound care product. The introduction of an expert multidisciplinary team has been shown to lead to a very significant reduction in the incidence of major amputation. It is likely that the availability or otherwise of prompt expert advice is the principal explanation for the major variations known to exist in the incidence of amputation, even within single countries.

### Debridement for surgical wounds [^113yHBTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that the removal of necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. Numerous methods of debridement are available, but there is no consensus on which method is most effective for surgical wounds.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds.

- **Search methods**: In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound that required debridement and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies with 265 participants, aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990, and one was published in 2014. The studies were conducted in hospital settings in China, Denmark, and Belgium.

### Using computer vision and artificial intelligence to track the healing of severe burns [^116Tw3b8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn care management includes accurately assessing the severity of burns, particularly in distinguishing superficial partial-thickness burns from deep partial-thickness burns, to provide definitive, downstream treatment. Moreover, the healing of wounds in the subacute care setting requires continuous tracking to avoid complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) offer a unique opportunity to build low-cost and accessible tools for classifying burn severity and tracking changes in wound parameters, both in the clinic by physicians and nurses and asynchronously in the remote setting by the patients themselves.

Wound assessments can be achieved by AI-CV through the principles of image-guided therapy using high-quality 2D color images. Wound parameters may include spatial dimensions and the characterization of wound color changes, which demonstrate physiological changes such as the presentation of eschar/necrotic tissue, pustulence, granulation tissue, and scabbing. We present the development of an AI-CV-based Skin Abnormality Tracking Algorithm pipeline. Additionally, we provide the results on a single localized burn tracked over a 6-week period in the clinic and an additional 2-week period of home monitoring.

### Nurse staffing, the clinical work environment, and burn patient mortality [^117BMhFV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

The complexity of modern burn care requires an integrated team of specialty providers working together to achieve the best possible outcome for each burn survivor. Nurses are central to many aspects of a burn survivor's care, including physiologic monitoring, fluid resuscitation, pain management, infection prevention, complex wound care, and rehabilitation. Research suggests that, in general, hospital nursing resources — defined as nurse staffing and the quality of the work environment — relate to patient mortality. Still, the relationship between those resources and burn mortality has not been previously examined.

This study used a multivariable risk-adjusted regression model and a linked, cross-sectional claims database of more than 14,000 adult (≥ 18 years) thermal burn patients admitted to 653 hospitals to evaluate these relationships. Hospital nursing resources were independently reported by more than 29,000 bedside nurses working in the study hospitals. In high burn patient-volume hospitals (≥ 100/year) that care for the most severe burn injuries, each additional patient added to a nurse's workload is associated with 30% higher odds of mortality (P < .05, 95% CI: 1.02–1.94), and improving the work environment is associated with 28% lower odds of death (P < .05, 95% CI: 0.07–0.99). Nursing resources are vital in the care of burn patients and are a critical, yet previously omitted, variable in the evaluation of burn outcomes. Attention to nurse staffing and improvement to the nurse work environment is warranted to promote optimal recovery for burn survivors.

### Burns: Pathophysiology of systemic complications and current management [^115zdMby]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Treating burns requires early removal of the toxic eschar, usually within the first 24 to 72 hours. Removal of necrotic tissue reduces mortality and complications in patients with serious burns. This is typically achieved through surgical eschar excision and split-thickness autografts from healthy skin. Thus, burn treatment strategies often are limited by the available amounts of healthy skin still present.

Topical antimicrobial agents should be administered after initial decontamination to prevent bacterial colonization of the burn wound. Systemic agents are less successful in treating local infections because they do not reach the burn wounds in large concentrations due to the microthrombosis of vessels and wound edema. The area is then covered with a nonadherent dressing.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^111mCvHP]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Nonviable necrotic eschar impedes wound healing and can ultimately lead to the failure of soft tissue coverage in traumatic or high-risk wounds. Topical therapeutic agents can offer a less invasive alternative to surgical debridement of eschar. In this case study, a 40-year-old male with a traumatic right lower extremity amputation complicated by surgical incision ischemic eschar formation was reported. Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings was used to manage eschar noninvasively, extending over the incision site. Images were obtained during the five months of follow-up.

A five-month follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of the eschar and re-epithelialization of the skin in the affected region. The innovation of using honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings shows promise for enhancing healing outcomes in traumatic wounds that develop nonviable eschar. Surgical debridement of an amputation stump with a large ischemic eschar was avoided with the use of these dressings.

### Nexobrid [^116CM1h7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Nexobrid is indicated for eschar removal in adults and pediatric patients with deep partial thickness (DPT) and/or full thickness (FT) thermal burns.

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of Nexobrid have not been established for the treatment of chemical or electrical burns; burns on the face, perineum, or genitalia; burns on the feet of patients with diabetes mellitus or on the feet of patients with occlusive vascular disease; circumferential burns; or burns in patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease, including inhalation injury.

Nexobrid is not recommended for wounds contaminated with radioactive and other hazardous substances to avoid unforeseeable reactions with the product and an increased risk of spreading the noxious substance. It is also not recommended for the treatment of burn wounds where medical devices (e.g. implants, pacemakers, shunts) or vital structures (e.g. large vessels) could become exposed during eschar removal.

Nexobrid contains proteolytic enzymes and is indicated for eschar removal in adults and pediatric patients with deep partial thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns.

### Larval therapy for leg ulcers (VenUS II): Randomised controlled trial [^113Zikqj]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

The primary outcome of the study was the time to complete healing of the reference ulcer. Ulcer healing was defined as complete epithelial cover in the absence of a scab (eschar). This was assessed by a nurse and independently corroborated by another nurse one week later. In cases of disagreement, treatment continued until consensus on healing status was achieved. Nurses took digital photographs weekly for six months and then monthly. These were centrally assessed to determine healing status by two independent assessors, who were blinded to the treatment group.

Secondary outcomes included the time to debridement of the ulcer, health-related quality of life, microbiology (bacterial load and MRSA), adverse events, and ulcer-related pain. Debridement was defined as a cosmetically clean wound. Nurses recorded the date of wound debridement, which was also evaluated by masked independent assessors using digital photographs. The SF-12, previously identified as sensitive to changes in venous ulcer healing status, was utilized to measure participants' perceptions of health-related quality of life at baseline, and at three, six, nine, and twelve months.

Microbiological swabs were collected at baseline and after the removal of each trial debridement treatment during the first month (if the ulcer debrided within one month, then weekly until one month), and then monthly until healing or trial completion. Blind laboratory analysis measured total bacterial load (10^x copies/ml) and the presence or absence of MRSA.

Adverse events were categorized as serious or non-serious.

### The current state of evidence-based protocols in wound care [^115HBeQM]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines have blossomed in the last 10 years in medicine as well as wound care. Physicians practicing wound care and attempting to use published clinical practice guidelines may, however, have difficulty judging the quality of these guidelines given legitimate concerns that many aspects of clinical practice guidelines are not being properly addressed.

- **Methods**: Guidelines were located using the National Guideline Clearinghouse website, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database for reviews on diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, and pressure ulcers. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation instrument was used to evaluate guidelines.

- **Results**: Search engines returned many irrelevant guidelines. Many guidelines would be difficult to evaluate by clinicians not versed in guideline evaluation and were cumbersome in format or were presented more as reference works. Too little attention is focused on such issues as clarity of presentation, consideration of multidisciplinary panels, stakeholder involvement, validity, testing, settings, resources required, cost impact, methods of addressing guideline implementation, and a means of tracking important criteria for feedback once the guideline is in the field. The venous and diabetic ulcer guidelines that were formally evaluated scored poorly in many of these areas despite using relatively sound methods for gathering and evaluating the evidence. Only the developers of one guideline made a commitment for regular update.

- **Conclusion**: Although progress has been made in regard to wound care clinical guidelines, there remains a significant need for improvement in their evaluation and implementation strategies.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^117WTGVX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Protocol**: The systematic review question was posed by members of the Toronto Central Local Health Integrated Network. In collaboration with the Toronto Central Local Health Integrated Network, our research team prepared a draft protocol that was revised to incorporate feedback from systematic review methodologists, policymakers, and clinicians with expertise in wound care. Our protocol also included conducting a related project comprising an overview of systematic reviews for treating complex wounds, and these results are available in a separate publication.

- **Information sources and search strategy**: On October 26, 2012, an experienced librarian conducted comprehensive literature searches in the following electronic databases from inception onwards: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The literature search was limited to adult patients and economic studies. The Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist was used by another expert librarian to peer review the literature search. The search was revised, as necessary, and the final MEDLINE search is documented separately. Full literature searches for the other databases are available upon request. The reference lists of the included studies were searched to identify additional relevant studies.

### Enzymatic debridement for burn wound care: Interrater reliability and impact of experience in post-intervention therapy decision [^111sgJCL]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2021). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Enzymatic debridement (ED) is an effective tool for eschar removal in partial-thickness to full-thickness burns and is gaining popularity in European burn centers. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of ED have been validated in numerous studies. However, promptly after ED, the result must be interpreted thoroughly, and further conservative or surgical therapy initiated. Especially in deep partial- and full-thickness burns, the decision for skin grafting or other reconstructive procedures is paramount for a successful clinical outcome. Therefore, evaluation of the wound shortly after the removal of the inactivated enzyme complex and eschar remnants has evolved into not only the most critical but also demanding point for successful ED application.

The present study revealed high variability in the decision for conservative care or surgical therapy post-ED, with a consensus (≥ 80% interrater reliability) achieved in merely 40%. Decision-making is based on clinical evaluation of the wound bed color and morphology, as well as the pattern and dynamics of bleeding points. In 2018, the first algorithm for post-ED wound bed evaluation and therapy decision was outlined in a European consensus: A uniform pink or red wound base and pinpoint bleeding pattern indicate good chances for spontaneous healing, while scattered big red circles on a pale wound base indicate reduced healing potential with deep dermal affection and skin grafting should be considered. Exposed subdermal fat or functional structures indicate complete loss of viable dermis, and in those cases, reconstructive procedures are recommended.

### Enhancement effect of terpenes on silver sulphadiazine permeation through third-degree burn eschar [^117AdhAf]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy remains one of the most important methods of wound management. Systemically administered antimicrobials may not achieve therapeutic levels in wounds, and most agents cannot penetrate burn eschar well enough when applied topically. Therefore, we tested the notion of increasing the permeability of eschar toward topical agents using terpenes, a well-known class of skin permeation enhancers. Four terpenes — limonene (hydrocarbon), eucalyptol (ether), alpha-pinene oxide (epoxide), and geraniol (alcohol) — were chosen, and their effects on the permeation of silver sulphadiazine (SSD), a widely used topical antimicrobial agent, through human third-degree burn eschar, were evaluated using static diffusion cells.

Results showed that terpenes increased the permeation flux of SSD through eschar significantly (P < 0.0001). Limonene provided the highest flux enhancement ratio (9.0 times), followed by geraniol, eucalyptol, and alpha-pinene oxide with enhancement ratios of 5.5, 4.7, and 4.3, respectively. The effects of terpenes on permeation lag-time were less than 20%. Data analysis revealed that terpenes increase the permeation of SSD mainly by increasing its partitioning into the eschar. The present results show that the permeation of drugs through burn eschar can be increased considerably by terpenes and that burn wound antimicrobial therapy may be improved by terpenes and possibly other penetration enhancers.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^115sARj2]. BMC Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Complex wounds are those that do not heal following a period of 3 months or more. These types of wounds pose a significant burden on the healthcare system and result in patient and caregiver stress, economic loss, and decreased quality of life. At least 1% of individuals living in high-economy countries will experience a complex wound in their lifetime, and over 6.5 million individuals have a complex wound in the United States alone. Moreover, these types of wounds have a significant economic impact. For example, $10 billion USD per year in North America is spent managing complex wounds, and 4% of the annual National Health Service expenditure in the United Kingdom is spent on care for patients with pressure ulcers.

There are three main categories of complex wounds: i) wounds resulting from chronic disease (e.g. venous insufficiency, diabetes), ii) pressure ulcers, and iii) non-healing surgical wounds. Treatment is targeted to the type of wound. Managing complex wounds resulting from disease usually involves improving the underlying disease; for example, optimizing diabetes control for patients with diabetes. A clinical assessment and history of mobility and neurological disability are often necessary to treat patients with pressure ulcers. Considerations for managing surgical wound infections include previous antibiotic treatment and immune response.

It is estimated that the global wound care market will reach over $22 billion USD annually by 2020. Due to the burgeoning costs from the management of patients requiring complex wound care, additional research and resource allocation are essential to optimize treatment strategies.

### Comparison of patients discharged to skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for COVID-19: A retrospective study [^115wh5Wp]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). High credibility.

The aim of the study is to identify differences in demographics, severity of disease, and rates of hospital readmission among adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for coronavirus 2019.

This is a retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalized with coronavirus 2019 infection at academic medical centers participating in the Vizient Clinical Data Base between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, who were discharged to skilled nursing facilities or inpatient rehabilitation facilities (N = 39,882). Data from the Clinical Data Base are used with permission of Vizient, Inc. All rights reserved.

Among adults hospitalized with coronavirus 2019 infection, those discharged to skilled nursing facilities were 1.4 times more likely to require hospital readmission than those discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. They were, on average, older (73 vs. 61 years, P < 0.001) and had shorter hospital lengths of stay (15 vs. 26 days, P < 0.0001) than the patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Persons discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities were more likely to have received intensive care and mechanical ventilation while hospitalized (P < 0.001).

Individuals discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for coronavirus 2019 differ from those discharged to skilled nursing facilities on a number of key variables, including age, hospital length of stay, having received intensive care, and odds of hospital readmission.

Regarding inpatient care for burn injuries, particularly in relation to vascular catheters, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend that local guidelines for the ongoing management of indwelling vascular catheters should address the following:

- **Dressing choice**: Guidelines should specify the preferred dressings to use.

- **Daily assessment of the site and monitoring of complications**: Regular checks are necessary to identify any issues early.

- **Accessing vascular access devices**: Ensure protocols are in place for appropriate and safe access.

- **Catheter replacement/rotation**: Clear plans should be established for the timely replacement or rotation of catheters.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^115oV1yN]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Conservative management using a honey-based salve may be a reasonable alternative in the appropriate patient population with close follow-up, in lieu of repeat surgical debridement and placement of skin grafts. Biologic agents have the potential to enhance healing and reduce incident infection. Although the use of honey is commonly reported in diabetic and burn wounds, this case report is, to our knowledge, the first description of honey-based salve and burdock leaves being utilized as a less-invasive alternative to sharp debridement and skin grafting of a traumatic wound eschar to achieve coverage. Necrotic eschar is an impedance to wound healing and can ultimately lead to failure of soft tissue coverage of a lower extremity amputation stump.

- **Key findings**: Less invasive approaches to eschar management can increase patient satisfaction and should be considered in similar scenarios. The use of effective biologic agents can reduce the need for surgical debridement and skin grafts. Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings may provide a less-invasive and highly effective strategy for eschar management.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^113m6awA]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

- **Limitations**: If tissue is deemed completely nonviable in the initial evaluation of the injury, or infection threatens the soft tissue envelope, then sharp debridement and swift intervention are indicated. Allergies to honey or burdock leaves will contraindicate the use of these biologics.

Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings was used in combination in this case of patient-centered care in managing the severely mangled extremity. Further study is needed to determine whether honey-based salve or burdock leaf dressings used alone would have similar efficacy in eschar management for this type of injury.

### Burns [^115YCBhx]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

During the past 20 years, as burn care has evolved as a specialty of surgery, both survival and outcome quality have significantly improved. Public expectations for survival and long-term outcomes are at unprecedented levels. These changes are the result of numerous advances in aspects of burn care that have developed in parallel, fostering the increasing regionalization of this resource-intensive activity into fewer specialized centers. These complex hospitalizations can be divided into four phases: initial evaluation and resuscitation, initial wound excision and biological closure, definitive wound closure, and rehabilitation and reconstruction.

### Eschar-associated spotted fever rickettsiosis, Bahia, Brazil [^1147HFKb]. Emerging infectious diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In the scientific literature from Brazil, the earliest reference to an eschar in a suspected case of BSF was in 1932. Subsequent eschar-associated cases have been identified in regions where BSF is endemic, such as the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espirito Santo, and in regions where it is not endemic, like the states of Santa Catarina along the Argentina border and Bahia, where the case reported in this article occurred. Clinical descriptions of eschar-associated rickettsioses in Brazil have been reported from BSF-endemic areas with large populations of Amblyomma dubitatum ticks but no known A. triste ticks, which are recognized vectors of Rickettsia parkeri in southern Brazil. Although A. dubitatum, a human-biting tick that is highly prevalent in many BSF-endemic areas, is a potential candidate for transmission of R. parkeri to humans in Brazil, this tick species and its vertebrate hosts, capybaras, have not yet been described in the Paty Valley, Bahia, where the patient acquired the rickettsial infection. Unfortunately, the ticks causing both cases in São Paulo and Bahia were not available for identification.

The taxonomic status of the etiologic agent of this novel rickettsiosis in Brazil cannot be definitively determined until it is isolated. Based on the available genetic information presented here and elsewhere, the pathogen detected in the cutaneous lesions of the patients from Bahia and São Paulo is equally distant from R. africae, R. parkeri, and R. sibirica. Each of these three SFGR species is among those long accepted by the International Committee.

### Collagenase Santyl [^113AcHuz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019).

- **Dosage and administration**: Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be applied once daily or more frequently if the dressing becomes soiled, such as from incontinence. When clinically indicated, crosshatching thick eschar with a #10 blade allows Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment more surface contact with necrotic debris. It is also desirable to remove, with forceps and scissors, as much loosened detritus as can be done readily. Use Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment in the following manner:

	1. Prior to application, the wound should be cleansed of debris and digested material by gently rubbing with a gauze pad saturated with normal saline solution or with the desired cleansing agent compatible with Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment, followed by a normal saline solution rinse.

	2. Whenever infection is present, it is desirable to use an appropriate topical antibiotic powder. The antibiotic should be applied to the wound prior to the application of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment. If the infection does not respond, therapy with Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be discontinued until remission of the infection.

	3. Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment may be applied directly to the wound or to a sterile gauze pad, which is then applied to the wound and properly secured.

	4. Use of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be terminated when debridement of necrotic tissue is complete and granulation tissue is well established.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^111zEcZ7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There are some limitations to our overview of systematic reviews. An inherent drawback of including systematic reviews is that the studies included in each of the reviews will have been published well before the search date. The inclusion of close to 100 systematic reviews, however, provides a breadth of information that is unlikely to significantly change with the inclusion of recently published studies. Although we appraised the methodological quality of the included reviews, we did not assess the risk of bias in the included studies in the systematic reviews. This is because a risk of bias tool for systematic reviews currently does not exist, but we are aware of one being developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Furthermore, we only included systematic reviews that were disseminated in English due to resource constraints. However, we attempted contacting authors to receive English translations. In addition, although we included five unpublished systematic reviews, we attempted to obtain unpublished data from a further 10 systematic reviews that were available as conference abstracts, yet we didn't receive a response from the review authors. As such, our findings are likely representative of published literature written in English. Since we did not conduct a meta-analysis, we were unable to formally test for publication bias.

Our results suggest the need for a network meta-analysis, given the numerous interventions and comparators available and examined across the literature. Policy-makers focus their decisions at the systems level so require information on all treatment.

### Recommendations on pregnancy, childbirth and aftercare in epidermolysis bullosa: a consensus-based guideline [^115CKyzV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

- **Care of caesarean section wound**: Offer nonadherent dressings and MARS for caesarean section wounds. These generally heal well; however, blistering of the scar site has been described.

- **Prevention of venous thrombosis**: Avoid compression stockings for women with severe EB due to the unavoidable shearing forces associated with use. Patients with EB do not appear to be at greater risk for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy/postpartum, compared with other pregnant women. However, in women at high risk of a thromboembolic event, low‐molecular‐weight heparin can be given as per local guidelines.

- **Infant feeding**: Assess factors such as the woman's EB subtype, social support structures, condition of wounds on breasts or hands, and pain management when supporting a woman in deciding how to feed her baby.

- **Support for breastfeeding and breast care**: Discuss breastfeeding and/or formula feeding options with the woman antenatally. Some women will have a strong intention to breastfeed their newborn, while others may be concerned about possible nipple blistering. Breastfeeding among women with EB has been reported, although nipple blistering is common and may limit ongoing efforts. Offer to assist with positioning of the baby and adequate latching onto the areola, which may reduce subsequent blistering. Well‐lubricated nipple shields may be useful, and the support of a lactation consultant can be helpful.

- **Formula feeding and mixed feeding**: Plan support for women with pseudosyndactyly who may need assistance.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^116iX2Kg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Almost half of the included systematic reviews were rated as being of high methodological quality according to the AMSTAR tool. Consistent methodological shortcomings include not using a protocol to guide their conduct, not including a list of excluded studies at the full-text level of screening, and not addressing or referring to publication bias. Results reported in systematic reviews with higher scores on the AMSTAR tool are likely the most reliable. Furthermore, some studies only provided wound care patients with two days of treatment or followed patients for only two days. The utility of these short studies is questionable, and studies of longer duration are recommended.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: Best care practice guidelines [^114wxQhR]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To maintain appropriate moisture levels and facilitate the healing of wounds, dressings should be non-adherent and appropriate in size for older patients. Infected wounds will require more frequent dressing changes. Changing dressings one limb at a time is advocated in infants to reduce the likelihood of having the skin rubbed off the opposite limb by feet kicking together, causing new, painful lesions. This approach also decreases the chance of bacterial spread from a colonized wound to an uncontaminated area.

For baths, adding salt to the water is recommended as for older patients. In addition to environmental adjustments, many infants will require analgesics for bath and dressing changes. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids are all used, as for older patients. Codeine is not recommended when alternatives are available, as neonates lack the capacity to metabolize the drug into active metabolites, and clinical responses are highly variable at all ages due to polymorphisms in codeine's metabolic pathway.

Severely affected newborns with deep tissue damage may require extensive pharmacologic support to achieve a level of comfort. These infants may require around-the-clock or continuous infusion of opioids and an adjuvant. A transition to methadone for better steady-state levels should be considered.

### Management of acute changes in condition in skilled nursing facilities [^112QhB3e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). High credibility.

To describe the presentation and management of acute changes in condition in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) during the implementation of a program designed to reduce unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations, a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial involving 264 SNFs was conducted.

One hundred thirty-three of the 264 participating SNFs provided data on acute changes in condition: 55 in the intervention group and 78 in the control group. During a 12-month period, intervention SNFs received training and support for implementing the Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers program. Control SNFs were offered the same training and implementation support after the end of the 12-month trial.

Project champions used a structured online tool to describe acute changes in condition that did not result in a hospital transfer within 72 hours of the change. Most of the 7,689 episodes of acute change in condition reported involved multiple changes that were not disease specific. Ten percent resulted in hospital transfer between 72 hours and 7 days after the change. Five acute changes had odds ratios for transfer greater than 2: mental status change, abnormal vital signs, bleeding, shortness of breath, and unresponsiveness. Most transfers were for reasons other than the initial change in condition.

In conclusion, a wide variety of acute changes in condition can be managed in SNFs without hospital transfer. Most of these changes are nonspecific and multiple.

### Management of diabetic wounds: Expert panel consensus statement [^115sLdSF]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). High credibility.

The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based, unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem. Population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides clinicians with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings.

- **Recent advances**: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes, rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs.

- **Critical issues**: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing. This includes careful management of blood glucose levels and optimization of off-loading strategies.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^111VrCtV]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Complex wounds represent a major challenge for clinicians and wound care specialists. Despite recent advances in wound care therapies and our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying chronic wounds, adherence to the basic tenets of wound care remains essential. These tenets include thorough assessment, medical and nutritional optimization, debridement (including surgery), offloading (or compression), management of ischemia, management of infection, and appropriate wound bed preparation. Following these principles and established wound care guidelines should often lead to satisfactory outcomes.

The rational use of advanced wound care therapies is encouraged when wounds do not respond sufficiently to standard care within 4 weeks or sooner if circumstances dictate. In most cases, the selection of advanced therapies should be evidence-based to ensure their most appropriate use.

### Better wound care begins with better evidence: Outcomes of the Wound Care Evidence Summit [^116DJUXT]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). High credibility.

In 2022, the Alliance of Wound Care Stakeholders convened the 2-day Wound Care Evidence Summit™. The Summit brought together a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that included payers, government agency policymakers, prominent researchers, wound care medical specialty societies, patient and clinical associations, wound care clinics, and manufacturers to discuss wound care evidence and coverage issues. The Summit focused on a wide variety of wound care topics, with an emphasis on the processes payers use to create their coverage policies and the type, quantity, and characteristics of clinical evidence payers require.

The most valuable outcome of the Summit was the frank and open discourse among stakeholders, with unprecedented participation from payers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the subjects of trial design, product-approval pathways, and coverage policy determination. Stakeholders provided actionable ideas for ways to improve clinical trial research and design that will yield better evidence and ultimately better wound care. This article examines the quality, adequacy, and relevance of the existing chronic wound care research base and discusses the gaps, associated problems, and implications for clinical trial design and execution as identified by Summit participants.

### Eschar with cellulitis as a clinical predictor in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin abscess [^117K4weq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This study was designed to determine the validity of a central eschar with surrounding cellulitis as a clinical predictor for CA-MRSA infection. In this 10-month prospective observational study, patients with a chief complaint or clinical findings of skin infection with abscess had study data sheets placed on their chart. All abscesses were treated with incision and drainage, and wound cultures were obtained. Exclusionary criteria included patient age under 18 years, recent incarceration within 14 days, and hospitalization or nursing home residence within 10 days.

Correlation of wound culture results with recorded physical examination determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values. A total of 224 patients with abscesses were enrolled; 18 patients met exclusion criteria. Additionally, 78 patients were excluded because no wound cultures had been obtained, the study data form was incomplete, or there was no evidence of wound cellulitis. Of the 128 remaining patients, 91 wound cultures grew MRSA, indicating a 71% prevalence. Of these 91 cases, 50 tested positive for central black eschar, yielding a sensitivity of 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45–0.65). Thirty-seven patients had abscesses that grew non-MRSA bacteria, and three of these were positive for central black eschar, yielding a specificity of 92% (95% CI 0.83–1.01). The positive predictive value was 94% (95% CI 0.88–1.01) and the negative predictive value was 45% (95% CI 0.32–0.59). A central black eschar with cellulitis has good specificity and high positive predictive value in diagnosing CA-MRSA infection.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^1121tJEw]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Comprehensive literature searches were conducted from inception until October 2012 across MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search terms included both medical subject headings (MeSH) and free text terms related to wound care interventions. Literature searches were conducted by an experienced librarian on October 26, 2012. Utilizing validated search filters, the search strategies were limited to human participants, adults, and systematic reviews. The electronic database search was supplemented by searching for systematic review protocols in the PROSPERO database, contacting authors of conference proceeding abstracts for their unpublished data, and scanning the reference lists of the included systematic reviews.

The search strategy was peer-reviewed by another expert librarian using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies checklist and amended as necessary. The final search strategy for the MEDLINE database is presented in Additional file 2. The literature search was limited to adults, reviews, and economic studies. The latter limitation was employed to identify cost-effectiveness analyses for a second paper that examines the cost-effectiveness of complex wounds [Tricco et al, unpublished paper submitted to BMC Medicine]. The MEDLINE search was modified for the other two databases as necessary. Search strategies for the EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews are available from the corresponding author upon request.

### Acute burn care [^117PC9Jw]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). High credibility.

After studying this article and viewing the videos, the participant should be able to:

1. Describe the epidemiology of burn injuries.
2. Understand burn pathophysiology and perform a wound assessment.
3. Summarize the initial emergency management of a burn patient.
4. Calculate the anticipated fluid resuscitation requirements for a burn injury, and diagnose the complications of overresuscitation.
5. Describe the diagnosis and management of inhalation injury.
6. List the goals of wound care for superficial and deep burns, and describe the closed dressing technique.
7. Perform excision of a burn wound.
8. Compare various wound closure techniques using autografts and skin substitutes.

Plastic surgeons are essential members of the multidisciplinary burn team. Burn injuries remain common, and plastic surgeons have an opportunity to develop and innovate the field of acute burn care in light of workforce shortages. Burn pathophysiology is complex and dynamic, which informs the challenges encountered during the perioperative phase. Accurate burn wound assessment remains difficult, with implications for diagnosis and management. A systematic approach is required when stabilizing a major burn and/or inhalation injury, with newly updated fluid resuscitation and triage guidelines. Wound care continues to evolve, with an emphasis on a closed dressing technique. For deeper burns, new surgical techniques are emerging for surgical débridement, along with improvements to traditional methods of tangential excision.

### WHS guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers-2023 update [^115kUNn3]. Wound Repair and Regeneration (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pressure ulcers, particularly concerning wound dressings, the WHS 2024 guidelines recommend choosing dressings based on clinical judgment and ensuring they meet the following requirements:

- **Maintain a moist wound environment**: The dressing should keep the wound adequately hydrated to promote healing.

- **Manage the wound exudate**: It is crucial for the dressing to effectively absorb and manage wound fluids.

- **Protect the skin surrounding**: Dressings should safeguard the skin around the ulcer to prevent further damage.

- **Minimize issues with friction, shearing, skin irritation, and additional pressure**: Select products that reduce these risks to enhance patient comfort and recovery.

- **Cost-effective**: Dressing choices should be economically viable without sacrificing quality care.
