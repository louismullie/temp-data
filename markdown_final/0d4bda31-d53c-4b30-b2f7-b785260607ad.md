## Question

What comorbid conditions are linked to weight?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about comorbid conditions linked to weight, particularly overweight and obesity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the scope and operational definitions for "weight-related" disease. Then, I should systematically extract and categorize comorbidities by organ system, distinguishing adult and pediatric considerations. Next, I will verify key screening recommendations and age cutoffs. After that, I need to consider mechanistic links that explain why excess adiposity drives these conditions. Finally, I will double-check for completeness, highlight multimorbidity patterns, and ensure references align with high-credibility guidance where possible [^113gZjNh] [^112K3zLY] [^115MdemK].

> Let me first confirm scope and definitions. Overweight and obesity are typically defined by BMI thresholds that correlate with excess adiposity and risk, and obesity is recognized as a chronic disease state that independently impairs health and shortens lifespan while driving multiple comorbidities across systems, particularly cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among others [^113gZjNh] [^112K3zLY] [^115MdemK]. Hold on, I should verify the emphasis on cardiovascular mortality burden; ESC consensus attributes roughly two-thirds of obesity-related excess mortality to cardiovascular disease, which sets the clinical context for prioritizing cardiometabolic screening and management in patients with excess weight [^112K3zLY].

> I will now examine cardiometabolic comorbidities because they are the most consequential clinically. Obesity increases risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, thromboembolism, stroke, and sudden cardiac death, with risk modulation by visceral adiposity and metabolic health status; mechanistically, adipose dysfunction, insulin resistance, and inflammatory signaling contribute to this burden [^112K3zLY] [^115MdemK] [^1161nwYA]. Wait, let me verify hypertension and dyslipidemia as key intermediates; guideline-based screening and treatment of blood pressure and lipids are integral to risk reduction in both adults and youth with obesity, with pediatric guidance recommending lipid screening from age 10 and BP measurement at every visit starting at age 3 in those with overweight or obesity [^115HdYH2] [^114nS3F7]. I should also confirm the diabetes linkage; obesity is a major driver of type 2 diabetes, partly via ectopic fat and hepatic/pancreatic insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome clusters these risks in a way that amplifies cardiovascular outcomes [^112XADWd] [^1161nwYA] [^113gZjNh].

> Next, I should review endocrine and reproductive disorders. Let me consider PCOS, which is tightly linked to insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism; pediatric and endocrine guidelines recommend screening adolescent girls with obesity for menstrual irregularities and clinical hyperandrogenism, and management often overlaps with weight and metabolic control [^1127ESEG] [^1165JhJT]. I need to check the pregnancy-related risks in women with excess weight; obesity raises the risks of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with implications across the reproductive life course and interpregnancy care [^114iScvs].

> Turning to respiratory disorders, I should confirm obstructive sleep apnea as a core comorbidity. Both adult and pediatric guidance support targeted screening for OSA symptoms and polysomnography when indicated; OSA is also a strong predictor of perioperative risk in bariatric populations, underscoring the need for early identification and treatment such as CPAP and weight reduction strategies [^1127ESEG] [^117KFZie]. Wait, I should double-check asthma; obesity is associated with asthma and altered airway mechanics, and AACE/ACE recommends assessing for asthma/reactive airway disease in all patients with overweight or obesity, including history, exam, and spirometry for those at risk [^113qWXzz] [^116AwHWU].

> I will now examine hepatobiliary disease. Hold on, let me verify pediatric thresholds; AAP and Endocrine Society guidance recommend screening from age 10 for abnormal ALT to assess for metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease in children with obesity, or earlier with risk factors, and similar vigilance applies to adults with central adiposity and metabolic risk [^115HdYH2] [^114nS3F7] [^1165JhJT]. Mechanistically, ectopic liver fat is central in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes, making MASLD/NAFLD a pivotal node in the obesity–diabetes axis [^112XADWd].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal complications. Osteoarthritis of weight-bearing joints is more prevalent with excess weight; AACE/ACE suggests symptom assessment and exam-based screening in all patients with overweight or obesity given the high burden of pain and functional impairment that may limit activity prescriptions [^114oF5k5]. In pediatrics, I should confirm slipped capital femoral epiphysis; clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion with hip or knee pain and gait changes, restrict activity, and refer urgently to orthopedics given the risk of progression and morbidity in youth with severe obesity [^1127ESEG]. I also need to check chronic pain prevalence in adolescents with severe obesity, which further degrades quality of life and complicates behavior change interventions [^115QDZeq].

> Next, I should review mental health and neurologic conditions. Depression and binge eating disorder are common in severe obesity and bariatric candidates, and guidelines recommend screening for depression and broader psychosocial comorbidities as part of comprehensive care to optimize outcomes and adherence [^111jiRea] [^112JqwTz] [^112yp44n]. Wait, let me verify pediatric neurologic risks; clinicians should maintain suspicion for idiopathic intracranial… hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "idiopathic intracranial hypotension", but in obesity the concern is idiopathic intracranial hypertension, especially among adolescent females, which requires prompt evaluation for papilledema and visual symptoms to prevent vision loss [^1127ESEG].

> I will now examine oncologic associations. Obesity adversely affects risk and outcomes for several cancers, with particularly robust links for endometrial, postmenopausal breast, colorectal, and other obesity-related malignancies, mediated by insulin/IGF-1 signaling, sex hormones, and inflammatory adipokines; this underscores the importance of weight management and metabolic risk reduction in cancer prevention strategies [^114K2gjQ] [^113o9UyD]. Hold on, I should verify that obesity-related cancer burden is also reflected in post-bariatric outcome studies; metabolic surgery appears associated with reduced incidence and mortality from several obesity-related cancers, which aligns with the systemic benefits of substantial and sustained weight loss [^113o9UyD].

> Considering renal and genitourinary issues, I need to check the cardiorenal axis benefits of weight loss; bariatric surgery confers renal and cardiovascular improvements, while urinary incontinence often coexists with excess weight and is a common, highly dissatisfying symptom that can improve with weight reduction and pelvic floor strategies [^113o9UyD] [^113WeKn1]. Erectile dysfunction is also more prevalent with obesity via vascular and endocrine mechanisms, and a weight-centered approach can ameliorate risk factors even if not directly curative in every case [^113gZjNh].

> Now, let me consolidate pediatric-specific comorbidities and screening priorities. For children and adolescents with obesity, I should double-check the AAP/ES guidance: screen for dyslipidemia, abnormal glucose metabolism, MASLD via ALT, and measure blood pressure routinely; assess for OSA with sleep history and polysomnography when symptomatic; evaluate for PCOS in adolescent girls; maintain vigilance for slipped capital femoral epiphysis with hip/gait findings; and keep a high index of suspicion for idiopathic intracranial hypertension; also screen for depression from age 12 with a validated tool [^115HdYH2] [^114nS3F7] [^1127ESEG] [^1165JhJT]. Hold on, I should verify the instruction about insulin levels; Endocrine Society advises against measuring fasting insulin to evaluate pediatric obesity given limited diagnostic utility, which helps streamline testing [^115JjfNo].

> I should confirm the pattern of multimorbidity because one condition increases the risk for others. Large cohort analyses show that obesity is associated with a network of 20+ diseases spanning cardiometabolic, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurologic, digestive, and infectious categories, with frequent clusters including diabetes, hypertension, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, and arrhythmias; this supports systematic, longitudinal comorbidity surveillance rather than single-disease thinking [^112aAFPY] [^117EGVUq]. But wait, what if we focus only on BMI? I need to ensure we also account for adiposity distribution and functional burden because risk is driven by visceral and ectopic fat as much as by absolute BMI categories [^112aAFPY].

> Let me think about mechanisms to tie this together. Rather than excess fat mass alone, adipose tissue dysfunction, limited safe subcutaneous expandability, ectopic lipid deposition in liver and other organs, hypoxia, and inflammatory signaling explain why some individuals with obesity develop cardiometabolic disease while others appear metabolically healthy, at least transiently; nonetheless, even "metabolically healthy" obesity carries elevated long-term cardiovascular risk compared with normal-weight peers [^116aehz6] [^117CX3i6] [^112XADWd] [^115MdemK]. I should double-check that subphenotype severity is better captured by comorbidity load than BMI alone, which informs staging systems and prioritization of treatment intensity in clinical practice [^111Eay7s].

> Next, I should review practical screening and evaluation steps to operationalize this. AACE/ACE advises comprehensive assessments for weight-related complications beyond BMI, with specific screening for osteoarthritis, depression, and cardiovascular disease risk to guide referrals and risk modification, and periodic reevaluation to track evolving adiposity-related disease over time [^114rULHZ] [^114oF5k5] [^112JqwTz] [^113JcrYm]. In pediatrics, guideline-directed labs and structured psychosocial screening are essential, including fasting lipids, glucose/HbA1c or OGTT when indicated, ALT for MASLD, routine BP monitoring, depression screening from age 12, and targeted evaluation for OSA, PCOS, SCFE, and IIH to prevent irreversible morbidity [^115HdYH2] [^114nS3F7] [^1165JhJT] [^1127ESEG]. Hold on, I should verify the principle of concurrent treatment; AAP emphasizes treating obesity and comorbidities together, which improves feasibility and outcomes in real-world care pathways [^114nS3F7] [^111KznXh].

> To close the loop, I need to ensure I have captured the core comorbidity domains linked to excess weight: cardiometabolic diseases including ASCVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, T2DM, and metabolic syndrome; endocrine/reproductive conditions including PCOS and pregnancy complications; respiratory disorders including OSA and asthma; hepatobiliary disease including MASLD; musculoskeletal disease including osteoarthritis and SCFE; mental health and neurologic conditions including depression, BED, anxiety, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension; oncologic risks across several cancers; renal and genitourinary issues including CKD and urinary incontinence; with special pediatric screening algorithms and recognition of multimorbidity clustering that mandates comprehensive, longitudinal care [^113gZjNh] [^112K3zLY] [^115MdemK] [^1127ESEG]. Wait, let me verify completeness one more time; given the breadth of associations and variable individual risk, a staged, guideline-based approach with periodic reassessment remains the most clinically sound way to address weight-related comorbidities in both adults and children [^113gZjNh] [^114rULHZ] [^115HdYH2].

Weight-related comorbidities are chronic conditions that co-occur with excess body weight, including **type 2 diabetes** [^113gZjNh], **hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease** [^112K3zLY], **obstructive sleep apnea** [^113o9UyD], **non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** [^1145oWhY], osteoarthritis, certain cancers [^114K2gjQ], and mental health disorders [^112JqwTz]. These comorbidities are driven by insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and ectopic fat deposition [^115MdemK] [^112XADWd], and their risk rises with higher BMI and central adiposity [^113gZjNh] [^113o9UyD]. Weight loss **improves or resolves** many of these conditions [^113gZjNh] [^1177cwQ9], and management should address both weight and comorbidities concurrently [^114nS3F7] [^114rULHZ].

---

## Cardiometabolic comorbidities

Cardiometabolic conditions are among the **most prevalent and clinically significant** weight-related comorbidities [^115MdemK] [^112K3zLY]:

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)**: Strongly linked to obesity [^115MdemK] via insulin resistance [^113gZjNh] and ectopic fat deposition [^112XADWd].

- **Hypertension**: Elevated blood pressure [^112K3zLY] is common in obesity [^113gZjNh] and increases cardiovascular risk.

- **Dyslipidemia**: Characterized by elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and increased LDL cholesterol [^112K3zLY], contributing to atherosclerosis [^113gZjNh].

- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**: Includes coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke [^112K3zLY], with obesity as a major risk factor [^113o9UyD].

---

## Respiratory comorbidities

Obesity significantly affects respiratory health through **obstructive sleep apnea** [^112K3zLY], which is highly prevalent [^116aehz6] and associated with cardiovascular complications and reduced quality of life [^113gZjNh]. Obesity-related asthma is a distinct phenotype [^113qWXzz] characterized by **greater severity and treatment challenges** [^116AwHWU].

---

## Gastrointestinal and hepatic comorbidities

Excess weight adversely affects gastrointestinal and hepatic systems through **non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** [^1145oWhY], which is strongly associated with obesity [^113gZjNh] and may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [^116aehz6]. Gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1145oWhY] is common in obesity and contributes to **esophageal complications**.

---

## Musculoskeletal comorbidities

Obesity imposes significant mechanical stress on the musculoskeletal system, with **osteoarthritis** [^114oF5k5] particularly affecting weight-bearing joints and causing pain and functional impairment [^113gZjNh]. Chronic pain is commonly reported [^115QDZeq] among individuals with obesity, affecting **quality of life and mobility**.

---

## Endocrine and reproductive comorbidities

Obesity affects endocrine and reproductive health through **polycystic ovary syndrome** [^113qs6tt], which is associated with obesity [^113gZjNh], insulin resistance, and reproductive dysfunction. Obesity-related hormonal imbalances contribute to **infertility** in both men and women [^113gZjNh] [^114iScvs].

---

## Cancer

Obesity **increases the risk** of several cancers [^112K3zLY], including breast, colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, and liver cancers, with obesity-related metabolic disruptions contributing to risk and progression [^114K2gjQ].

---

## Mental health comorbidities

Obesity is associated with significant mental health challenges; **depression and anxiety** commonly co-occur [^112JqwTz] and affect quality of life and treatment adherence [^113gZjNh]. Eating disorders, including **binge eating disorder** [^111jiRea] and others, are prevalent among individuals with obesity.

---

## Pediatric weight-related comorbidities

Children and adolescents with excess weight are at **increased risk** [^114nnd2Q] of:

- **Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes**: Increasingly diagnosed in pediatric populations [^114nnd2Q] with obesity.

- **Hypertension and dyslipidemia**: Early onset cardiovascular risk factors [^114nnd2Q].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Common in pediatric obesity [^1127ESEG], impacting growth and development.

- **Psychosocial issues**: Depression, anxiety, and social stigma significantly impact pediatric populations [^112yp44n].

---

## Clinical assessment and management

Effective management of weight-related comorbidities **involves**:

- **Comprehensive clinical evaluation**: Regular assessment [^114rULHZ] of anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters, cardiovascular risk, respiratory function, musculoskeletal health, and mental health.

- **Concurrent treatment**: Addressing both excess weight and comorbidities simultaneously [^114nS3F7] to optimize health outcomes.

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Dietary modifications, physical activity, and behavioral therapy [^113gZjNh] as first-line treatments.

- **Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery**: Considered for individuals with severe obesity or refractory comorbidities (Pharmacotherapy [^113gZjNh] and bariatric surgery [^113o9UyD]).

---

Weight-related comorbidities are chronic conditions linked to excess body weight, including cardiometabolic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, endocrine, cancer, and mental health disorders [^116aehz6]. Weight loss **improves or resolves** many of these conditions, and management should address both weight and comorbidities concurrently [^1177cwQ9] [^114rULHZ].

### Obesity and cardiovascular disease: An ESC clinical consensus statement [^112K3zLY]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

The global prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past four decades, currently affecting more than a billion individuals. Beyond its recognition as a high-risk condition causally linked to many chronic illnesses, obesity has been declared a disease per se, resulting in impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy. Notably, two-thirds of obesity-related excess mortality is attributable to cardiovascular disease. Despite the increasingly appreciated link between obesity and a broad range of cardiovascular disease manifestations, including atherosclerotic disease, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, obesity has been underrecognized and sub-optimally addressed compared with other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

In view of the major repercussions of the obesity epidemic on public health, attention has focused on population-based and personalized approaches to prevent excess weight gain and maintain a healthy body weight from early childhood through adult life, as well as on comprehensive weight loss interventions for persons with established obesity. This clinical consensus statement by the European Society of Cardiology discusses evidence on the epidemiology and aetiology of obesity; the interplay between obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardiac conditions; the clinical management of patients with cardiac disease and obesity; and weight loss strategies, including lifestyle changes, interventional procedures, and anti-obesity medications, with particular focus on their impact on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Obesity in adults [^113o9UyD]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Obesity has increased in prevalence worldwide, and the WHO has declared it a global epidemic. Population-level preventive interventions have been insufficient to slow down this trajectory. Obesity is a complex, heterogeneous, chronic, and progressive disease that substantially affects health, quality of life, and mortality. Lifestyle and behavioral interventions are key components of obesity management; however, when used alone, they provide a substantial and durable response in a minority of people.

Bariatric (metabolic) surgery remains the most effective and durable treatment, with proven benefits beyond weight loss, including cardiovascular and renal health, and decreased rates of obesity-related cancers and mortality. Considerable progress has been made in the development of pharmacological agents that approach the weight loss efficacy of metabolic surgery, and relevant outcome data related to these agents' use are accumulating. However, all treatment approaches to obesity have been vastly underutilized.

### Association of obesity-related metabolic disruptions with cancer risk and outcome [^114K2gjQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Over the past 40 years, the prevalence of obesity has increased epidemically worldwide, raising significant concerns regarding public health and the associated economic burden. Obesity is a major risk factor for several conditions, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that obesity negatively affects cancer risk and outcome. The relationship between obesity and cancer is complex and involves multiple factors at both the systemic and cellular level. Disruptions in insulin metabolism, adipokines, inflammation, and sex hormones all contribute to the adverse effects of obesity in cancer development and progression.

The focus of this review is the impact of these systemic obesity-related factors on cancer biology, incidence, and outcome. Potential therapeutic interventions and clinical trials targeting obesity and its associated factors will also be discussed.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^113RerpR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

While moderate weight loss in people with obesity and an increased type 2 diabetes risk may be sufficient to prevent or delay the disease, a greater weight loss seems to be required to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. An average weight loss of 7% was not sufficient to significantly improve cardiometabolic endpoints in the Look AHEAD trial, whereas type 2 diabetes remission was related to weight loss greater than 15 kg in the DIRECT trial, which employed a very low-calorie diet approach, and through obesity/type 2 diabetes treatment with metabolic surgery in adults and adolescents.

The examples from type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment trials suggest that the magnitude of weight loss and duration of the disease represent important determinants of the health benefits of weight loss interventions. For other diseases and conditions, the required weight loss to improve or resolve the obesity-associated complication is variable and depends on the severity of the disorder, but most likely also on the strengths of the causal link between obesity and its specific comorbidity.

### What is my goal? Expected weight loss and comorbidity outcomes among bariatric surgery patients [^113WeKn1]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A number of reasons lead patients to undergo weight loss procedures. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients often have unrealistic weight loss goals. However, there is a general lack of information regarding patients' expectations about comorbidity improvement and resolution. This study aims to examine the impact of patients' comorbid conditions on their motivation to undergo bariatric surgery. Furthermore, it examines patients' expectations regarding postoperative weight loss and comorbidity improvement.

- **Methods**: Forty-five subjects completed a modified Goals and Relative Weights Questionnaire assessment one week before their anticipated bariatric surgery. The first portion addressed patients' personal weight loss goals and factors influencing their procedure selection. The second part assessed expectations and evaluations of various specifically determined weight loss outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 45 patients completed the survey: laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) 23/45; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB) 22/45. The mean goal percentage of excess weight loss was 85.0% (21–130%). This translated to 80.2% (21–127%) in the LAGB group and 90.5% (37–130%) in the RNYGB group. Of 13 possible reasons, the "desire for change in medical comorbidities" was deemed most important in choosing a goal weight. Comorbidities with the highest dissatisfaction levels included urinary incontinence and hypertension. All patients expected some degree of comorbidity improvement one year post-surgery, with 26% (6/23) achieving significant improvement.

### Obesity and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases [^115MdemK]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The prevalence of obesity has reached pandemic proportions; approximately 25% of adults in Westernized countries have obesity. Recognized as a major health concern, obesity is associated with multiple comorbidities, particularly cardiometabolic disorders. In this review, we present obesity as an evolutionarily novel condition, summarize the epidemiological evidence on its detrimental cardiometabolic consequences, and discuss the major mechanisms involved in the association between obesity and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. We also examine the role of potential moderators of this association, with evidence for and against the so-called 'metabolically healthy obesity phenotype', the 'fatness but fitness' paradox, or the 'obesity paradox'. Although maintenance of optimal cardiometabolic status should be a primary goal in individuals with obesity, losing body weight and, particularly, excess visceral adiposity seems necessary to minimize the risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^1127ESEG]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for childhood obesity, specifically with respect to the evaluation for comorbidities, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend assessing for symptoms and signs of the following comorbidities in pediatric and adolescent patients with obesity:

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Elicit a sleep history, including symptoms of snoring, daytime somnolence, nocturnal enuresis, morning headaches, and inattention, to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea in pediatric and adolescent patients with obesity. Obtain polysomnography in case of at least one symptom of disordered breathing.

- **PCOS**: Assess for menstrual irregularities and signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) to evaluate the risk for PCOS in female adolescent patients with obesity.

- **Depression**: Monitor for symptoms of depression in pediatric and adolescent patients with obesity. Obtain an annual evaluation for depression with a formal self-report tool in adolescent patients aged ≥ 12 years.

- **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis**: Obtain a musculoskeletal review of systems and perform a physical examination (internal hip rotation in a growing child, gait) as part of obesity evaluation. Instruct immediate and complete activity restriction, non-weight-bearing with the use of crutches, and refer to an orthopedic surgeon for emergent evaluation in patients with suspected slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Consider referring the patient to an emergency department if an orthopedic surgeon is not available.

- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension**: Maintain a high index of suspicion for idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with obesity.

### Obesity pathogenesis: An Endocrine Society Scientific Statement [^1134jXhz]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity is among the most common and costly chronic disorders worldwide. Estimates suggest that in the United States, obesity affects one-third of adults, accounts for up to one-third of total mortality, is concentrated among lower-income groups, and increasingly affects children as well as adults. A lack of effective options for long-term weight reduction magnifies the enormity of this problem; individuals who successfully complete behavioral and dietary weight-loss programs eventually regain most of the lost weight.

We included evidence from basic science, clinical, and epidemiological literature to assess knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying excess body-fat accumulation, the biological defense of excess fat mass, and the tendency for lost weight to be regained.

- **Energy homeostasis**: A major area of emphasis is the science of energy homeostasis, the biological process that maintains weight stability by actively matching energy intake to energy expenditure over time. Growing evidence suggests that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight. We need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this "upward setting" or "resetting" of the defended level of body-fat mass, whether inherited or acquired.

The ongoing study of how genetic, developmental, and environmental forces affect the energy homeostasis system will help us better understand these mechanisms and is therefore a major focus of this statement. The scientific goal is to elucidate obesity pathogenesis so as to better inform treatment, public policy, and preventive measures.

### Evaluating the cutaneous manifestations and associated comorbidities of childhood obesity [^112GqBK3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Rates of childhood obesity are rising, making it a public health concern due to its link to numerous poor health outcomes over the lifespan. In adults, obesity is associated with various inflammatory skin conditions; however, this is not well-studied in children with obesity. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TrinetX Research Network Database, evaluating children under 18 with and without obesity, focusing on various dermatologic conditions and comorbidities. Childhood obesity was associated with increased rates of all dermatologic conditions and associated comorbidities evaluated (p < 0.05). This study highlights associations between various dermatologic conditions and comorbidities in children with obesity compared with those without, emphasizing the need for early intervention and management strategies to mitigate obesity-related health complications in pediatric populations.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^116aehz6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic multisystem disease associated with shortened life expectancy due to a number of adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological data link body weight and parameters of central fat distribution to an increasing risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, obesity is associated with osteoarthritis, mental disorders, and some types of cancer. However, the individual risk of developing cardiometabolic and other obesity-related diseases cannot entirely be explained by increased fat mass. Rather than excess fat accumulation, dysfunction of adipose tissue may represent the mechanistic link between obesity and adverse health outcomes.

There are people living with obesity who seem to be protected against the premature development of cardiometabolic diseases. On the other hand, people with normal weight may develop typical obesity diseases when there is dysfunction of adipose tissue and predominantly visceral fat distribution. The mechanisms linking impaired function of adipose tissue in people with obesity include:

- **Adipocyte hypertrophy, altered cellular composition, limited expandability of safe subcutaneous fat stores**: This includes ectopic fat deposition in visceral depots, the liver, and other organs.
- **Hypoxia, a variety of stresses, inflammatory processes**: These processes result in the release of pro-inflammatory, diabetogenic, and atherogenic signals.

Genetic and environmental factors might contribute either alone or via interaction with intrinsic biological factors to variation in obesity-related outcomes.

### Predicting complications after bariatric surgery using obesity-related co-morbidities [^117KFZie]. Obesity Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

To determine which, if any, pre-surgery obesity-related co-morbidities predict complications after bariatric surgery, claims data from 1,760 patients aged 18–62 were analyzed. These patients were covered by one of seven New York State health plans and underwent bariatric surgery between 2002 and 2005. The data encompassed 6 months before and 18 months after surgery.

- **Pre-surgery obesity-related comorbidities studied include**: Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, sleep apnea, GERD, and depression.
- **Specific post-surgery complications examined are**: Stenosis, complications associated with the anastomosis, dumping syndrome, and sepsis.

Obesity-related co-morbidities prior to surgery are significantly correlated with the probability of developing complications up to 180 days after bariatric surgery. For example, sepsis was significantly more likely in patients who had diabetes, arthritis, or sleep apnea prior to surgery. An additional pre-surgery comorbidity is associated with a 27.5% higher likelihood of dumping syndrome, a 24.5% higher likelihood of complications associated with the anastomosis, and a 23.5% higher probability of sepsis within the first 180 days after surgery. Among the individual co-morbidities studied, sleep apnea and GERD are most predictive of complications.

In conclusion, patients who exhibit multiple obesity-related co-morbidities prior to bariatric surgery are at a significantly elevated risk of post-surgery complications and merit closer monitoring by healthcare professionals after bariatric surgery. Limitations of this study include non-experimental design and the potential impact of unmeasured confounding variables.

### Obesity as a disease: The Obesity Society 2018 position statement [^116xsr9s]. Obesity (2019). Low credibility.

The emerging obesity epidemic and accompanying health consequences led The Obesity Society (TOS) in 2008 to publish a position paper defining obesity as a disease. Since then, new information has emerged on the underlying mechanisms leading to excess adiposity and the associated structural, cardiometabolic, and functional disturbances. This report presents the updated TOS 2018 position statement on obesity as a noncommunicable chronic disease.

- **Study design**: This was a cross-sectional study linking data from 3,361 fifth-grade students from the 2003 Children's Lifestyle and School Performance Study with Nova Scotia administrative health data over 6 years.

- **Results**: Overweight and obese children were more likely to have had a diagnosis of internalizing disorders, asthma, other respiratory disorders, obesity, otitis media, and chronic adenoid/tonsil disorder. Conversely, normal-weight children were more likely to have a diagnosis of conduct disorder or other mental diseases. Except for internalizing disorders, overweight and obese children also had significantly higher health care costs for these conditions.

- **Conclusion**: Overweight and obese children had higher health care utilization across a range of diagnoses, further confirming that health care utilization patterns of overweight and obese children differ from those of their normal-weight peers. Greater attention to the relationship between more common childhood conditions and overweight and obesity is needed, given the greater prevalence in overweight and obese children and the fact that some of the more established obesity-related conditions occur less frequently, particularly in younger children.

### Assessment of obesity-related comorbidities: A novel scheme for evaluating bariatric surgical patients [^1164qzKt]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery serves as the superior means of achieving sustained weight loss and improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. Results of bariatric surgery have been reported qualitatively without standardized measurement of comorbidity response. The objective of this work was to develop a clinically based, standardized system for scaled assessment of the major comorbidities of obesity in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

- **Study design**: We constructed a standardized grading scheme for the major comorbidities of obesity, with each condition scored from 0 to 5 according to severity. Data were prospectively collected on 226 patients. Ninety patients have already undergone gastric bypass and are being followed at regular intervals postoperatively. The longest follow-up interval is 1 year.

- **Results**: Preoperative evaluation of comorbidities identified a total of 1,356 medical disorders. Anatomic comorbidities were most prevalent as a category, although psychosocial impairment was the most common single condition. The majority of comorbidities in our patient population were graded mild (score of 1) to moderate (score of 3). Immediate (2 weeks) follow-up was available for all operated patients and ranged in number to 1 year postoperatively, depending on the date of operation. A statistically significant reduction in the severity of several comorbidities was observed at postoperative evaluation (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: This scheme for assessment of obesity-related comorbidities facilitates evaluation of bariatric surgical patients. The system allows standardization in assessing the outcomes of such surgeries.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^115HdYH2]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, particularly with respect to pediatric patients, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend eliciting a comprehensive patient history, obtaining mental and behavioral health screening, evaluating social determinants of health, and performing a physical examination. The following diagnostic studies are advised to evaluate for obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years with overweight or obesity:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate for dyslipidemia in pediatric and adolescent patients aged 10 years or older with obesity or overweight. Consider evaluating for lipid abnormalities in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.
- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate for abnormal glucose metabolism. This is recommended for patients aged 10 years or older with obesity, or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).
- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate for abnormal liver function in patients aged 10 years or older with obesity, or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.
- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at 3 years of age to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

### Body-mass index and risk of obesity-related complex multimorbidity: An observational multicohort study [^117EGVUq]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Association of BMI category with incident obesity-related disease and multimorbidity**: The 21 obesity-related diseases were highly interconnected, meaning that the presence of one disease increased the risk of developing another, with many associations being bidirectional. Among the first four diseases in participants with obesity and complex multimorbidity, there were 140 different disease combinations, each of low prevalence (≤ 12 [6.2%] of 195 participants). Four (2.9%) of 140 disease combinations included diseases from one ICD-10 chapter only, 23 (16.4%) from two chapters, and 68 (48.6%) from three or four chapters.

The obesity-related diseases that occurred most frequently in participants with obesity and complex multimorbidity were adult-onset diabetes (147 [75.4%] of 195 participants), hypertension (140 [71.8%]), sleep disorders (83 [42.6%]), osteoarthritis (82 [42.1%]), arrhythmias (67 [34.4%]), bacterial infections (61 [31.3%]), and asthma (43 [22.1%]).

### Management of obesity across women's life course: FIGO best practice advice [^114iScvs]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). High credibility.

What is obesity and why does it matter to women's health?

Obesity is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as abnormal or excessive adipose accumulation that puts health at risk. The most common method to calculate obesity is body mass index (BMI). According to the Obesity Medicine Association's 2021 definition, obesity is described as a chronic, progressive, relapsing, and treatable multi-factorial, neurobehavioral disease. The presence of excess adipose or fat tissue causes endocrine and physical changes to the body's health and functioning, as well as impacting psychosocial well-being. As a result, obesity has been shown to cause long-term effects on many aspects of women's health.

Understanding the global impact of obesity is important for all healthcare providers in countries of all income levels. According to WHO population statistics for 2016, 40% of women had overweight and 15% had obesity. Low- and lower-middle-income countries, as defined by the World Bank income group, also demonstrate significant rates of obesity in the most recent available data.

### Type 2 diabetes as a disease of ectopic fat [^112XADWd]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although obesity and diabetes commonly co-exist, the evidence supporting obesity as the major driver of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the mechanisms by which this occurs are now better appreciated.

- **Discussion**: This review briefly examines several sources of evidence — epidemiological, genetic, molecular, and clinical trial — to support obesity being a causal risk factor for T2DM. It also summarizes the ectopic fat hypothesis for this condition and lists several pieces of evidence to support this concept, extending from rare conditions and drug effects to sex- and ethnicity-related differences in T2DM prevalence. Ectopic liver fat is the best-studied example of ectopic fat, but more research on pancreatic fat as a potential cause of β-cell dysfunction seems warranted. This ectopic fat concept broadly fits with the observation that individuals of similar ages can develop diabetes at markedly different body mass indexes (BMIs). Those with risk factors leading to more rapid ectopic fat gain — for example, men (compared with women), certain ethnicities, potentially those with a family history of diabetes, and others with genes linked to reduced subcutaneous adiposity — are more likely to develop diabetes at a younger age and/or lower BMI than those without.

- **Summary**: Obesity is the major risk factor for T2DM and appears to drive tissue insulin resistance in part via gain of ectopic fat, with the best-studied organ being the liver. However, ectopic fat in the pancreas may contribute to β-cell dysfunction.

### Body-mass index and risk of obesity-related complex multimorbidity: An observational multicohort study [^112aAFPY]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

The accumulation of disparate diseases in complex multimorbidity makes prevention difficult if each disease is targeted separately. We aimed to examine obesity as a shared risk factor for common diseases, determine associations between obesity-related diseases, and examine the role of obesity in the development of complex multimorbidity (four or more comorbid diseases).

- **Methods**: We conducted an observational study and used pooled prospective data from two Finnish cohort studies, namely the Health and Social Support Study and the Finnish Public Sector Study, comprising 114,657 adults aged 16–78 years at study entry (1998–2013). A cohort of 499,357 adults (aged 38–73 years at study entry; 2006–10) from the UK Biobank provided replication in an independent population. Body Mass Index (BMI) and clinical characteristics were assessed at baseline. BMIs were categorized as obesity (≥ 30.0 kg/m²), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m²), healthy weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m²), and underweight (< 18.5 kg/m²). Via linkage to national health records, participants were followed-up for death and diseases diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs) for associations between BMI and multimorbidity were calculated.

- **Findings**: The mean follow-up duration was 12.1 years (SD 3.8) in the Finnish cohorts and 11.8 years (SD 1.7) in the UK Biobank cohort. Obesity was associated with 21 non-overlapping cardiometabolic, digestive, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, and infectious diseases after Bonferroni adjustment.

### Obesity is an independent risk factor for mortality in otherwise healthy patients after hepatectomy [^117Vh4Jx]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Low credibility.

Obesity is often associated with comorbidities that limit remnant liver recovery after hepatectomy. The extent to which obesity, in the absence of comorbidities, impacts surgical risk after hepatectomy is unknown. We hypothesized that an obese population without major comorbidities would not be at increased risk of adverse outcomes after hepatectomies.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis identifying patients who underwent hepatectomies from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set, spanning 2005 to 2017. Outcomes of interest included the following: mortality, any morbidity, critical care complications, and failure to discharge home. Body mass index (BMI) was the primary variable of interest, grouped as ≥ 35 and < 35 based on bivariate tests of associations with candidate cut-off points. In an attempt to isolate the effect of obesity on outcomes among patients "without major comorbidities" (WOC), we included patients without diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, and nonsmokers; remaining patients were grouped as "with major comorbidities" (WC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to test whether obesity is independently associated with the outcomes of interest after adjustment for other covariates.

- **Results**: A total of 36,396 patients were included. There were 13,754 patients in the WOC group and 22,642 in the WC group. Among patients in the WOC group, the adjusted odds of mortality were 2.2 times higher for patients with a BMI ≥ 35 versus a BMI < 35. Among the patients in the WC group, [text cut off].

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111qhySA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Targeting individual complications may result in problematic polypharmacy, which increases the odds of side effects, drug-drug interactions, non-adherence, and cost. When treating obesity-related comorbidities, the preference is for therapy options that target the specific comorbidity without increasing body weight, a common problem with several medications used for the treatment of T2D. For example, the optimum approach to managing hyperglycemia would be the use of a weight-neutral, or even weight-reducing, agent, such as metformin, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, or a sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

As with all prescription drugs, doctor–patient discussions about the potential benefits and risks of a particular weight loss medication are encouraged, along with appropriate monitoring of individual responses.

### Severe obesity and comorbid condition impact on the weight-related quality of life of the adolescent patient [^115QDZeq]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

To assess links between comorbid health status, severe excess weight, and weight-related quality of life (WRQOL) in adolescents with severe obesity undergoing weight-loss surgery (WLS), a study was conducted to inform clinical care.

- **Study design**: Baseline (preoperative) data from Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery, a prospective multicenter observational study of 242 adolescents with severe obesity (Median BMI = 50.5 kg/m²; Mean age = 17.1; 75.6% female; 71.9% white) undergoing WLS, were used to examine the impact of demographics, body mass index (BMI), presence/absence of 16 comorbid conditions, and a cumulative comorbidity load (CLoad) index on WRQOL scores (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids).

- **Results**: WRQOL was significantly lower than reference samples of healthy weight, overweight, and obese samples. Of 16 comorbid conditions, the most prevalent were dyslipidemia (74.4%), chronic pain (58.3%), and obstructive sleep apnea (56.6%). Male subjects had a greater CLoad (P = .01) and BMI (P = .01), yet less impairment in total WRQOL (P < .01) than females. CLoad was a significant predictor of male WRQOL. For females, psychosocial (vs. physical) comorbidities, BMI, and white race were significant predictors of WRQOL impairment. Less prevalent conditions (e.g. stress urinary incontinence) also emerged as contributors to lower WRQOL.

WRQOL impairment is substantial for adolescents with severe obesity undergoing WLS, with predictors varying by sex. These patient-data highlight targets for education, support, and adjunctive care referrals before WLS.

### Progression of comorbidities in youth with overweight or obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117C4cZJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Childhood obesity rates have continued to increase with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, data are limited on the impact of increasing obesity on associated comorbidities.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the progression of overweight- or obesity-associated comorbidities by investigating changes in laboratory results pre-COVID-19 pandemic and post-COVID-19 pandemic onset in youth with overweight or obesity. We defined progression of comorbidities based on an increase in category rather than absolute change in value.

- **Results**: HbA1c progression was seen in 19%, and LDL cholesterol progression was seen in 26%, as defined by categories. HbA1c progression and LDL cholesterol progression were significantly correlated. HbA1c and LDL cholesterol progression were significantly associated with older age and Hispanics, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The results indicate youths with overweight or obesity have experienced progression of comorbidities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study emphasizes the importance of early detection of comorbidities among a high-risk pediatric population.

### Associations of weight loss with obesity-related comorbidities in a large integrated health system [^1117mS1Y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Weight change was associated with each of the 30 disease outcomes using a case-control design to determine if disease onset was more or less likely to be preceded by weight change in cases compared to patients that had not developed a disease outcome. Outcomes were selected from previous reports that identified these as strongly associated with obesity and high healthcare costs.

- **Patient groups**: For each clinical outcome, patients were divided into two groups: (a) patients with a recorded diagnosis (cases) and (b) patients with no record of the diagnosis at any time (controls).

- **Calculation of weight change**: For patients in the case group, 3-, 5-, and 10-year weight change was calculated as the BMI at the time of the first event (or within the preceding six months if missing) minus the BMI at three, five, and ten years prior (± six months). For patients in the control group, weight change was calculated as the last recorded BMI minus the BMI at three, five, and ten years prior (± six months).

Only cases and controls with weight measurements meeting these criteria were included. Weight changes were categorized accordingly.

### Mental health conditions among patients seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery: A meta-analysis [^111jiRea]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery is associated with sustained weight loss and improved physical health status for severely obese individuals. Mental health conditions may be common among patients seeking bariatric surgery; however, the prevalence of these conditions and whether they are associated with postoperative outcomes remain unknown.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of mental health conditions among bariatric surgery candidates and recipients, to evaluate the association between preoperative mental health conditions and health outcomes following bariatric surgery, and to assess the association between surgery and the clinical course of mental health conditions.

- **Data sources**: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE on OVID, and PsycINFO for studies published between January 1988 and November 2015. Study quality was assessed using an adapted tool for risk of bias; quality of evidence was rated based on GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.

- **Findings**: We identified 68 publications meeting inclusion criteria: 59 reporting the prevalence of preoperative mental health conditions (65,363 patients) and 27 reporting associations between preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative outcomes (50,182 patients). Among patients seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery, the most common mental health conditions, based on random-effects estimates of prevalence, were depression (19% [95% CI, 14%-25%]) and binge eating disorder (17% [95% CI, 13%-21%]). There was conflicting evidence regarding the association between preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative outcomes.

### Obesity: novel and unusual predisposing factors [^116PJjEE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Why is weight maintenance following weight loss so difficult to achieve?

The global obesity epidemic that has ensued over the last half-century is likely to have complex and multifactorial determinants. Obesity accounts for much chronic ill health globally and is associated with at least 50 obesity-related comorbidities. There is also a substantial global socioeconomic burden from obesity, with a significant proportion of healthcare costs stemming from management strategies required for obesity-related conditions. Cardiometabolic dysfunction mediates most obesity-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), hypertension, and other features of the metabolic syndrome, as well as obesity-related malignancies such as endometrial carcinoma.

For decades, attaining a healthy weight has represented and continues to represent a key goal of health and is thought to improve the future development of chronic ill health. Evidence to support the beneficial effects of weight loss in obesity, especially following bariatric surgery, is well established. However, lifestyle approaches to weight loss through changes in diet and physical activity appear to be unsuccessful when viewed from a perspective of weight maintenance following initial weight loss. Recent examples include the Diabetes Prevention Program, which demonstrated that, despite initial weight loss in the lifestyle group, gradual weight regain occurred over the 10 years following the initial lifestyle intervention. A further example is the Look AHEAD study, in which 44% of the intensive lifestyle intervention.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^114L9sqe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Global obesity rates have doubled since 1980, and in the United States, 70% of the population is now affected by excess weight or obesity. While overweight and obesity have traditionally been classified by body mass index (BMI) alone, the presence of related comorbidities is gaining importance as a diagnostic factor, as captured by the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) and the Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) system. For some individuals, overweight or obesity has little apparent effect on health or daily living (stage 0–1 of the EOSS, stage 0 of the CMDS system), with a proportion of these people having normal metabolic features despite increased adiposity ('metabolically healthy' overweight or obesity). For others, obesity is associated with chronic comorbidities, physical or psychological symptoms, and/or functional limitations, which can have a substantial negative impact on quality of life (stages 2–4 EOSS) and mortality (stages 2–4 CMDS system). Even apparently metabolically healthy obese people are at increased long-term risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality compared with metabolically healthy, normal-weight individuals.

- **Chronic conditions linked with overweight or obesity**: Coronary heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Multiple comorbidities are associated with obesity, of which only a proportion are shown.

### Adult obesity complications: challenges and clinical impact [^111GfVAp]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Obesity is a multisystem disease that increases the risk of the most common non-communicable chronic diseases of the 21st century. The population is developing obesity at a younger age, and it is likely that these individuals will suffer morbidity for longer. This will be challenging for clinicians because the symptom and disease burden from multi-organ impairment can become irreversible without timely intervention. Early identification of individuals with obesity through simple anthropometric measurements should be a priority for prompt interventions to prevent morbidity and the associated healthcare and economic costs.

Tackling obesity requires a whole systems approach. Governments and policymakers, rather than individuals, have the ability to change the food environment through regulation, taxation, and restricting the availability of high-calorie processed foods to adults and children. Patients with obesity who face weight-based discrimination deserve policies and legislation that aim to prevent weight-based inequality. This will help change the narrative that patients with obesity are to blame for their disease, which fuels a pervasive form of social stigma. Replacing this fallacy with scientific knowledge can prevent discrimination and facilitate referral to specialist weight management centers where a multidisciplinary team can provide bespoke patient care.

### Body composition methods: comparisons and interpretation [^111DYqJr]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of obesity in the United States and other developed countries is epidemic. Because the prevalence of comorbidities to obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, has also increased, it is clear there is a great need to monitor and treat obesity and its comorbidities. Body composition assessments vary in precision and in the target tissue of interest. The most common assessments are anthropometric and include weight, stature, abdominal circumference, and skinfold measurements. More complex methods include bioelectrical impedance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, body density, and total body water estimates. There is no single universally recommended method for body composition assessment in the obese, but each modality has benefits and drawbacks. We present here the most common methods and provide guidelines by way of examples to assist the clinician/researcher in choosing methods appropriate to their situation.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^117CX3i6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic multisystem disease associated with shortened life expectancy due to a number of adverse health outcomes. Epidemiological data link body weight and parameters of central fat distribution to an increasing risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, mental disorders, and some types of cancer.

However, the individual risk to develop cardiometabolic and other obesity‐related diseases cannot entirely be explained by increased fat mass. Rather than excess fat accumulation, dysfunction of adipose tissue may represent the mechanistic link between obesity and adverse health outcomes. There are people living with obesity who seem to be protected against the premature development of cardiometabolic diseases. On the other hand, people with normal weight may develop typical obesity diseases upon dysfunction of adipose tissue and predominantly visceral fat distribution.

The mechanisms linking impaired function of adipose tissue in people with obesity include adipocyte hypertrophy, altered cellular composition, limited expandability of safe subcutaneous fat stores, ectopic fat deposition in visceral depots, the liver and other organs, hypoxia, a variety of stresses, inflammatory processes, and the release of pro‐inflammatory, diabetogenic, and atherogenic signals. Genetic and environmental factors might contribute either alone or via interaction with intrinsic biological factors.

### Differential efficacy of weight loss interventions in patients with versus without diabetes [^111h8Mec]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Obesity is both a major risk factor for diabetes and a serious comorbidity of the condition. The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes have spread globally over the past few decades. Treatment of obesity in patients with diabetes provides a host of clinical benefits that encompass virtually all body systems. Despite this, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the efficacy of most therapies for weight loss is significantly reduced among patients with diabetes. With this background, we summarize the evidence of a differential effect of lifestyle, pharmacological, and surgical treatments for obesity in patients with existing diabetes, and explore the potential mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. This information is then used to formulate strategies to improve weight loss outcomes for patients with diabetes.

### Sex-specific obesity and cardiometabolic disease risks in low- and middle-income countries: A meta-analysis involving 3,916,276 individuals [^113qs6tt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Obesity is a major risk factor for severe morbidity and all-cause mortality globally, associated with cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. In women, excess body weight is also linked to sex-specific conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Notably, 6 in 10 individuals with obesity live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which are undergoing an epidemiological transition from infectious to noncommunicable diseases.

Obesity and its complications may differently affect women and men. The Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) reported the burden of both underweight and obesity to be higher in women than men globally. Accurate data on obesity and cardiovascular disease burden is a critical first step toward reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease in women by 2030. However, the extent of sex-related differences in the risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in LMICs, and variations in disparities between regions, country's income status, settings, and over time, is not known. Individual studies often focus on particular conditions or regions, reporting imprecise estimates. There is also a need to assess the strength of the association between obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in women in LMICs.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of sex-specific differences in the prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in LMICs.

### Obesity: Why be concerned [^113ZmCk6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic in the United States represents a critical public health issue that has the potential to incur major healthcare costs because of the substantial risks associated with excess body fat. Whereas many recognize the significant risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus associated with excess body fat, a myriad of other health problems can accompany overweight and obesity, potentially leading to early morbidity and mortality. Public recognition of obesity as an important health crisis, and not simply a matter of cosmetics or lifestyle choice, is clearly needed. A greater awareness of the health risks associated with excess weight will facilitate more frequent obesity screenings and discussions about healthy weight management, which have the potential to result in a greater commitment of healthcare resources to effective obesity prevention and management strategies.

### Adult obesity complications: challenges and clinical impact [^117Kmwy8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Adult obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m², was estimated to affect 10.8% of men (266 million) and 14.9% of women (375 million) worldwide in 2014. This represents more than a doubling compared to worldwide figures in 1975, where 3.2% of men and 6.4% of women were obese. If this trend persists, by 2025, 18% of men and 21% of women will be obese. Since 2006, the rise in adult obesity has remained stable in many developed countries; however, morbid obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m²) continues to rise. In developing countries, obesity prevalence is increasing towards levels observed in the Western world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a challenge for governments globally to prevent further rises in obesity by 2025 to achieve the overarching aim of preventing premature death from the four most common non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease.

The review presents epidemiological data on the complications of adult obesity and addresses some of the challenges associated with managing this disease at both population and individual levels.

### Factors affecting subspecialty referrals by pediatric primary care providers for children with obesity-related comorbidities [^116zSN3s]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

To determine referral patterns from pediatric primary care to subspecialists for overweight/obesity and related comorbidities, we utilized the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. This approach helped us identify overweight/obesity and five related comorbidities in primary care visits between 2005 and 2009 for children aged 6 to 18 years. The primary outcome measured was whether the visit resulted in a referral. Multivariable analysis was employed to examine factors associated with such referrals.

In our study, we identified 34,225 database visits. Among these, 17.1% involved patients who were either overweight (body mass index = 85th to 94th percentile) or obese (body mass index ≥ 95th percentile). Of the primary care visits with overweight or obese children, 7.1% concluded with a referral. Notably, referrals were more likely when obesity was the reason for the visit (odds ratio = 2.83; 95% confidence interval = 1.61–4.97), yet there was no significant association between referrals and the presence of comorbidities (odds ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval = 0.75–2.44).

In conclusion, the majority of overweight or obese children are not referred, irrespective of their comorbidity status. One potential reason for this is the low levels of appropriate diagnosis.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^111Eay7s]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

- **Prognostic significance of the obesity subphenotype**: In clinical practice, the heterogeneity of human obesity phenotypes is frequently observed. These subtypes of obesity include monogenic, childhood-onset, syndromic forms, and other variations that affect medical, functional, and psychological traits differently. Improved stratification of obesity subphenotypes may enhance the prioritization of treatment strategies and help identify individuals who would benefit most from weight loss interventions. If obesity severity is defined by the number and extent of obesity-related comorbidities, such as in the Edmonton Obesity Staging System, the highest mortality risk is indicated by the number of these comorbid conditions. Analysis of data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), which includes records from more than 3.5 million people in the United Kingdom from 1995 to 2015, found that the number of obesity complications correlates with increased risk for myocardial infarction or heart failure outcomes.

However, there are individuals with obesity who do not develop premature obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. These individuals, often described as having metabolically healthy obesity, appear to be protected against adipose tissue dysfunction and exhibit lower morbidity and mortality risks attributable to obesity. To investigate the factors underlying metabolically healthy obesity, we have recently compared pairs of individuals with obesity who do not have manifest metabolic comorbidities or cardiovascular risk factors. These pairs have been matched based on age, sex, and BMI.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: The epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^1177cwQ9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Obesity complications: Reversibility**. The fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. However, the etiology of obesity is more complex and involves biological, genetic, environmental, and societal factors. The complexity of the root causes in the pathogenesis of obesity may explain the challenges in the prevention and treatment of the disease. Despite these challenges and the notion that obesity is a chronic progressive disease, it can be treated by weight loss interventions. Behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical interventions represent the main strategies for the management of obesity.

The definition of obesity as a chronic disease rather than a risk factor for related diseases is justified by its distinct pathophysiology that leads to excess and ectopic fat accumulation. Moreover, the body defends its body weight by homeostatic mechanisms that hinder weight loss and promote further weight gain. Altered biological mechanisms, including changes in central neurocircuits and body–brain cross-talk, may explain why short-term interventions aiming at behavior changes are frequently not successful in providing sustained long-term weight loss.

Therefore, obesity treatment needs to be escalated by adding pharmacological and/or surgical interventions. With increasingly effective obesity therapies, obesity can be brought into remission in individual patients, but not yet on a large scale. Bariatric surgery represents the most effective treatment strategy for reducing body weight and improving obesity-related diseases.

### Burden of disease attributable to high body mass index: An analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^114yThU3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The increase in obesity has significant implications for the disease burden worldwide, yet the approach to addressing obesity is often disjointed and fragmented. There is a pressing global need to prevent obesity, starting from childhood and adolescence, promote weight loss, and reduce the risk of disease in individuals struggling with high BMI. High BMI is a whole-of-society and system-level problem requiring multi-stakeholder actions. Governments and communities must vigorously implement evidence-based policies to achieve global targets for controlling high BMI. Researchers should work on understanding how high BMI is changing globally and develop strategies to encourage behavioral changes. However, the effectiveness of behavioral changes in tackling the obesity epidemic is debatable vis-à-vis structural population-level interventions.

The debate between behavioral changes and structural population-level interventions in tackling obesity focuses on their respective impacts and effectiveness. Behavioral changes focus on individual habits and can yield short-term results, but they often fail to produce long-lasting effects without ongoing support. In contrast, structural interventions address broader environmental and systemic factors, potentially leading to widespread public health improvements. While behavioral strategies are helpful, they are usually limited in scope compared to structural changes that reshape the environment to support healthier choices on a larger scale.

It is reasonable that a combined approach might offer the most comprehensive solution to the obesity epidemic.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114nnd2Q]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for childhood obesity, specifically concerning the evaluation for comorbidities, AAP 2023 guidelines recommend eliciting a comprehensive patient history, obtaining mental and behavioral health screening, evaluating social determinants of health, and conducting a physical examination. The following diagnostic studies are advised to evaluate obesity-related comorbidities in patients aged 2–18 years with overweight or obesity:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain a fasting lipid panel to evaluate dyslipidemia in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity or overweight. Consider evaluating for lipid abnormalities in patients aged 2–9 years with obesity.

- **Diabetes**: Obtain fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c to evaluate abnormal glucose metabolism in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity. This is also applicable to those with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **MASLD**: Obtain an alanine transaminase measurement to evaluate abnormal liver function in adolescent and pediatric patients aged ≥ 10 years with obesity, or with overweight in the presence of risk factors for T2DM or MASLD.

- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure at every visit starting at 3 years of age to evaluate for hypertension in pediatric and adolescent patients with overweight and obesity.

### Understanding the risk of developing weight-related complications associated with different body mass index categories: a systematic review [^115tD4af]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Obesity is a disease in its own right but also a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), particularly heart disease and stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, fatty liver disease, hypertension, and some cancers. Obesity is, therefore, strongly associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Globally, obesity prevalence is rising, with a close to tripling of worldwide prevalence between 1975 and 2016, bringing the number of adults with overweight to 1.9 billion, of whom over 650 million had obesity.

Obesity and overweight are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation causing a deterioration in health. Epidemiologically, obesity is also classified by body mass index (BMI), a simple index derived from weight (kg) and height (m²). A BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m² is classified as overweight, and obesity as a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m², further subdivided into class I (30.0–34.9 kg/m²) and class II (35.0–39.9 kg/m²). A BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m² is referred to as class III obesity.

### Obesity prevention: recommended strategies and challenges [^111JobsY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Lifelong healthy weight maintenance is an important goal for all Americans to avoid the health problems associated with excessive body weight. In those who are overweight, even modest weight loss can reduce the risk of developing diseases associated with obesity. Federal health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have recognized the critical nature of the obesity epidemic and the importance of lifelong weight management. As a result, these agencies have published evidence-based dietary and exercise recommendations, as well as analyses of population-based efforts to achieve weight loss that specifically address strategies to maintain a healthy weight.

Despite the availability of recommendations and increased public education efforts, obesity rates continue to climb. The rising prevalence of obesity in the United States suggests that efforts to control weight have been inadequate. Large-scale prevention programs involving interventions targeting individuals as well as the larger community, including initiatives spearheaded through workplaces and schools, are needed to control weight and reduce the risk of long-term health consequences.

### Interventions targeting comorbid depression and overweight/obesity: A systematic review [^115wSu3e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity, along with depression, are highly co-occurring conditions with shared pathophysiology, as well as social and economic determinants. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that aims to comprehensively synthesize extant literature with a focus on the effectiveness of interventions targeting obesity and depression comorbidity.

- **Methods**: We searched databases including MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, from the inception of the databases until November 12, 2021. Articles were included if they reported on the effects of pharmacological, psychological, or dietary interventions on comorbid depression and overweight/obesity as their primary or secondary outcome.

- **Results**: Of the 5,480 identified records, 19 eligible researches comprising 15 RCTs and 4 uncontrolled longitudinal studies for 3,408 participants with comorbid depression and overweight/obesity were reviewed. The available literature is not sufficient to inform evidence-based treatments targeting obesity and comorbid depression concurrently. However, the combination of CBT and lifestyle intervention shows efficacy in targeting obesity and comorbid depression, as do some nutritional supplements, antidepressants, and anti-diabetic agents.

- **Limitations**: The high heterogeneity of various interventions in the included studies may cause a lack of comparability between different studies.

- **Conclusions**: Management of depression and overweight/obesity is suggested by available data. There is a pressing need for studies that evaluate the effectiveness in real-world samples.

### Childhood obesity: Aetiology, comorbidities, and treatment [^114c7dRu]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Obesity is currently considered a global epidemic, and its implications on mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients and in adulthood are increasingly important. The objective of this article is to review in detail the definition of obesity according to age group and, in turn, the epidemiology of this condition both worldwide and in South America. Available evidence about pathophysiology and associated comorbidities is reported concerning some of the most important and clinically relevant body systems. Recommendations on pharmacological and non-pharmacological management through lifestyle changes and relevant aspects of bariatric surgery in the pediatric population are also described.

### Self-reported comorbidities among self-described overweight African-American and Hispanic adults in the United States: Results of a national survey [^114MQMEr]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the concordance between self-described weight status and BMI, the prevalence of self-reported comorbidities, and the association between comorbidities and self-rated health among overweight African-American and Hispanic US adults, a study was conducted.

A nationally representative sample of 537 African-American and 526 Hispanic adults, identified using a combination of random digit dialing and listed household sampling, self-described as being slightly or very overweight and participated in a telephone interview. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI.

More than half of African Americans (56%) and one-third of Hispanics (34%) who self-described as "slightly" overweight would be classified as obese based on BMI. One-third (33%) of African Americans reported high blood pressure, followed by arthritis (20%), high cholesterol (18%), and diabetes (15%). Among Hispanics, high cholesterol was the most frequently reported comorbidity (17%), followed by high blood pressure (15%) and difficulty sleeping (12%). Almost three-quarters of African Americans surveyed (72%) reported that their overall health was good to excellent compared to 62% for Hispanics.

Self-reported rates of obesity-related comorbidities fall below what would be expected based on prevalence data derived from physiologic measures, suggesting a lack of awareness of actual risk. Despite the greater self-reported prevalence of certain risk factors for poor health, African Americans have a more optimistic view of their overall health and weight.

### Does physical activity ameliorate the health hazards of obesity [^1178KAoj]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Obesity is an established risk factor for chronic disease and premature death, but losing weight and keeping it off is difficult. Therefore, although obese individuals may know that they are at higher risk of disease and early death, they still may not be able to lose weight and maintain weight loss. Perhaps health professionals should focus less on weight and more on how to enhance and maintain health for people of all sizes and shapes.

### Cardiovascular biomarkers of obesity and overlap with cardiometabolic dysfunction [^1161nwYA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity has increased in recent decades, reaching over 30% in the U.S. population. Obesity is associated with several metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Both obesity and MetS have been linked to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Investigations into proteomic signatures of obesity and metabolic dysfunction have yielded important insights into the biological pathways that drive cardiometabolic disease. Previous work has implicated the insulin growth factor axis and inflammation in the regulation of obesity and insulin resistance.

In this context, we sought to investigate proteomic signatures of cardiometabolic disease, including obesity, different adipose depots, and related clinical traits. We hypothesized that distinct aspects of cardiometabolic dysfunction would be associated with different characteristic proteins. We leveraged cardiovascular biomarkers ascertained as part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Systems Approach to Biomarker Research in Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, which used high‐throughput technologies to identify novel circulating biomarkers in participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Using the Systems Approach to Biomarker Research in Cardiovascular Disease platform, we examined the associations of 71 protein biomarkers with cardiometabolic traits, including traditional metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity as well as regional adiposity.

### Recorded diagnosis of overweight/obesity in primary care is linked to obesity care performance rates [^11355qyn]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence supports the treatment of obesity and comorbidities to achieve weight loss, avoid further weight gain, and improve obesity-related comorbidities. Therefore, it may be helpful for pediatricians to include the diagnosis of obesity in a patient's problem list to heighten awareness and remind providers to address weight concerns at subsequent clinic encounters. Notably, in a large adult study, documentation of an obesity diagnosis on a problem list was independently predictive of at least a 5% weight loss.

Comorbidity evaluation may confer benefits for improved weight outcomes. In adult studies, identifying obesity-related comorbidities has been described as a motivating factor to address weight concerns. The ACTION study found that people diagnosed with obesity were more likely to report successful weight loss. This supports previous findings that talking to patients about weight increases their desire to lose weight and enhances perceptions of weight issues. Evidence in pediatrics on this subject is sparse and inconsistent. Among 4,000 youth aged 10–18 years with overweight or obesity in a primary care network, BMI-z slopes per year decreased after HbA1c measurements. Among those who had an HbA1c test, the decline in BMI-z slope was greater among those with HbA1c in the prediabetes range. However, another study did not find a positive effect on BMI change following cholesterol evaluation.

Children with overweight and obesity may also benefit from health behavior and lifestyle treatment, which is child-focused, family-centered, or coordinated.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, specifically in the context of assessing obesity-related complications such as osteoarthritis, the AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend screening for osteoarthritis of the knee and other weight-bearing joints. This should be done through symptom assessment and physical examination in all patients with overweight or obesity.

For patients with obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or heart failure (HF), the AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend against offering weight loss specifically to prevent cardiovascular events or prolong life in patients with congestive HF. Although evidence suggests that weight loss can improve myocardial function and alleviate symptoms of congestive HF in the short term, it should not be pursued solely for these objectives.

### Evaluating the implementation of expert committee recommendations for obesity assessment [^1131V2wp]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity and their associated morbidities are well established, yet rates of diagnosis and screening for related conditions by clinicians are low. Expert Committee recommendations were released in 2007 to facilitate management of pediatric overweight and obesity. From well-child visits to a Massachusetts multisite group practice, we randomly selected one visit per child in 2006 (n = 56,374) and in 2008 (n = 69,681) and used electronic health record data to identify children with incident overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile). We ascertained whether clinicians assigned relevant ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) codes and ordered laboratory tests recommended for children aged 10 years and older. In the year following the release of recommendations, a large majority of children aged 2 to 17 years with a BMI ≥ 85th percentile lacked diagnosis codes for overweight and obesity, as well as the recommended laboratory orders for assessment of obesity-related comorbidities for children 10 years and older. This suggests the need to augment approaches to increase the uptake of guidelines.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111Jw6Tv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Obesity is a heterogeneous disease, and therefore individualizing therapy is important. Treatment approaches should take into account the underlying causes of obesity. If a complication from obesity exists, targeting both the excess weight and the comorbid disease would be advisable to improve benefit. Pharmacological therapies have their place, as well as limitations, in obesity treatment. Promising medications for long-term weight management have recently emerged, adding to the possibilities for bespoke weight loss programs.

### Understanding the risk of developing weight-related complications associated with different body mass index categories: A systematic review [^115CYeTL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Furthermore, obesity imposes an increasing economic burden on society and exacerbates the costs of both obesity-related and unrelated comorbidities. This is especially true for class III obesity, which has a disproportionately large burden on the healthcare system. In 2013, the healthcare burden of individuals with a BMI above 35 kg/m² was 60% of total obesity-related costs. By 2030, obesity above a BMI of 35 kg/m² is predicted to rise to one in four adults in the United States, becoming the leading BMI category for certain populations, including women, non-Hispanic Black adults, and low-income adults. Direct healthcare and indirect economic cost burdens are forecast to reach upwards of tens of billions of dollars per year by 2030.

Overweight, a precursor to obesity, significantly increases the risk of developing many complications also related to obesity. The overweight and obesity class I–III cut-offs were developed in Western populations but vary depending on ethnicity. For example, the original class I, BMI 30–34.9 kg/m², has been lowered for Asian and South Asian populations to BMI 27.5 kg/m² or 25 kg/m². To consider the health consequences of overweight while potentially distinguishing them from those that are not the result of excess adipose tissue, the patient population with a BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m² was included in this systematic literature review (SLR) population criteria when a weight-related complication was present.

### Obesity primer for the practicing gastroenterologist [^1145oWhY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

With the worsening of the obesity pandemic, gastroenterologists will encounter more patients with this chronic disease. Given the association between obesity and several gastrointestinal conditions, and the interplay between obesity pathophysiology and gut hormones, gastroenterologists can play an important role in the management of this disease. Furthermore, as more patients undergo bariatric surgery, an understanding of postsurgical anatomy and the medical and endoscopic management of bariatric surgical complications is essential. This article provides clinical tools for the assessment and management of obesity for the general gastroenterologist. It also includes tables with high-yield practical information for quick reference.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, specifically the assessment of obesity-related complications, the AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining clinical evaluations for weight-related complications, including anthropometric assessments of adiposity and clinical assessments of weight-related complications, in all patients with overweight or obesity. This is because BMI alone is not sufficient to indicate the impact of excess adiposity on health status. It is advised to reevaluate patients with overweight or obesity at intervals to monitor for any changes in adiposity and adiposity-related complications over time.

### Obesity and hormonal influences on asthma: Mechanisms, management challenges, and emerging therapeutic strategies [^116AwHWU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Obesity and hormone dysregulation, common comorbidities of asthma, not only influence asthma risk and onset but can also complicate its management. The pathobiologic characteristics of obesity, such as insulin resistance and metabolism alterations, can impact lung function and airway inflammation while highlighting potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Likewise, obesity alters immune cell phenotypes and corticosteroid pharmacokinetics. Hormones such as sex hormones, incretins, and thyroid hormones can also affect asthma. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying obesity-related asthma and hormonal pathologies while exploring potential therapeutic strategies and the need for more research and innovative approaches in managing these comorbid conditions.
