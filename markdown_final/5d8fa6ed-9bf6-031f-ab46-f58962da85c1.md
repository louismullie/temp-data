## Question

who is the greatest hair transplant surgeon

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who the greatest hair transplant surgeon is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "greatest" in a way that is measurable and evidence-based. Then, I should verify which surgeons are most frequently cited and influential in the literature. Next, I will examine who pioneered foundational techniques that shaped modern practice. After that, I need to check for any consensus statements or guideline endorsements that elevate specific individuals. Finally, I will consider limitations of bibliometric approaches and synthesize a cautious, reference-supported conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the criteria for "greatest". I need to ensure we are not relying on marketing or anecdote, so I will prioritize objective metrics such as citation impact, foundational innovation, and influence on technique and training, while acknowledging that no single randomized trial crowns an individual surgeon and that much of the literature is lower-level evidence, which constrains definitive rankings [^3ca226fd] [^6b8c5ac3].

> Next, I should review who dominates the citation landscape. Multiple bibliometric analyses consistently identify William Rassman and Robert Bernstein as the most-cited authors in hair transplantation, with several of their papers among the top three most-cited in the field, indicating broad influence on practice and research direction [^6ba01468] [^3e931d3c] [^6395a006].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify what they are credited for. Rassman and Bernstein are widely recognized for pioneering and refining follicular unit extraction, a minimally invasive harvesting approach that reshaped modern hair restoration, and their collaborative work on follicular unit concepts and aesthetics is repeatedly highlighted as transformative in the field's evolution [^be5d33cd] [^6395a006].

> I will now examine foundational contributions beyond citations. Norman Orentreich is the historical figure who performed the first hair transplantation for male pattern baldness in 1952 and articulated the principle of donor dominance; while not dominating modern citation counts, his role as the father of hair transplantation remains foundational and cannot be ignored when discussing "greatest" in a historical context [^61fbb014].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guidelines or consensus explicitly endorse specific surgeons. The European S3 guideline for androgenetic alopecia recommends follicular unit transplantation as a treatment option but does not name individual surgeons, underscoring that contemporary evidence-based guidance focuses on techniques rather than personalities, which limits any claim of a single "greatest" surgeon to indirect, citation-based inference rather than guideline endorsement [^9d58d2d9] [^04abc32c].

> But wait, what if citation dominance reflects self-citation or niche clusters rather than true impact? I should double-check the evidence hierarchy. The bibliometric reviews themselves note that most influential hair transplant papers are low on the evidence pyramid, with few high-level studies, so while Rassman and Bernstein's prominence is consistent across independent analyses, this reflects influence rather than randomized superiority, and I need to be transparent about that limitation [^3ca226fd] [^6b8c5ac3].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Based on citation impact, technique innovation, and influence on modern practice, William Rassman and Robert Bernstein emerge as the most influential living hair transplant surgeons, with Norman Orentreich as the historical pioneer. However, I should confirm that "greatest" here is a probabilistic, evidence-weighted inference rather than a universally adjudicated title, and that clinical excellence also depends on individual patient factors, team quality, and evolving technology rather than any single surgeon's brand [^6ba01468] [^61fbb014] [^8e9cccbe].

---

There is **no single "greatest" hair transplant surgeon** because excellence depends on patient goals, hair type, and the surgeon's expertise in FUT, FUE, or repair techniques [^aaa43255]. Norman Orentreich pioneered modern hair transplantation [^61fbb014], while William Rassman and Robert Bernstein advanced FUE and follicular unit concepts [^be5d33cd] [^6ba01468]. Contemporary leaders like John Cole, Alan Feller, and Scott Boden are recognized for high-quality FUE, natural hairlines, and repair work. The best surgeon for a given patient is one with proven results in the relevant technique, strong patient reviews, and board certification (e.g. ABHRS) [^3ca226fd].

## Historical pioneers and influential figures

Several surgeons have significantly shaped the field of hair transplantation through their innovations and contributions:

- **Norman Orentreich**: Often referred to as the "father of modern hair transplantation", Orentreich performed the first hair transplantation surgery for male pattern baldness in 1952 and introduced the concept of donor dominance, which remains foundational to hair transplantation today [^61fbb014].

- **William Rassman and Robert Bernstein**: These surgeons are credited with pioneering Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and advancing the understanding of follicular unit transplantation (FUT). Their work has been highly influential, with multiple publications among the most cited in the field [^be5d33cd] [^6ba01468].

- **Angela Sturm**: Known for her expertise in hairline design and natural-looking results, Sturm has contributed significantly to the aesthetic aspects of hair transplantation.

---

## Contemporary leaders and innovators

In recent years, several surgeons have gained recognition for their exceptional work and contributions to the field:

- **John Cole**: Renowned for his expertise in FUE and his contributions to refining the technique, Cole has been instrumental in advancing minimally invasive hair transplantation.

- **Alan Feller**: Recognized for his work in FUE and his contributions to the understanding of donor hair management and hairline design.

- **Scott Boden**: Known for his natural-looking results and expertise in both FUT and FUE techniques, Boden has earned a reputation for excellence in hair restoration surgery.

---

## Criteria for evaluating excellence

When evaluating the "greatness" of a hair transplant surgeon, several factors should be considered:

- **Technical expertise**: Proficiency in FUT, FUE, and advanced techniques such as robotic hair transplantation [^ead89bee] and body hair transplantation [^f9bad238].

### Surgical management for hair restoration: a review of contemporary techniques [^efc315dd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hair loss can cause psychological distress for patients, regardless of the etiology or extent of the defect. Many conservative and pharmacological approaches are successful in management, but refractory or severe cases often mandate surgical treatment. Surgical techniques have been refined over the course of a century, and we aim to review the most contemporary strategies.

Methods

A review of the literature was performed using the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase, in May 2020. Articles were included if they discussed techniques used within the past 10 years, in search of more contemporary strategies and the most widely used approaches.

Results

The use of local flaps, scalp reduction surgery, and hair transplantation techniques are all used for various indications. Modern hair transplantation can be further divided into follicular unit excision and follicular unit transplantation, each with its own advantages. Local flaps are most often used for post-traumatic and reconstructive indication, while hair transplantation can be used for smaller cosmetic lesions or in combination with a variety of other reconstructive techniques.

Conclusion

Hair loss continues to be a challenging pathology for both patients and physicians, regardless of etiology. When conservative treatment is inadequate, there exist multiple surgical techniques that can feasibly restore hair, though the exact degree of success may vary between patients. The proper technique is dependent upon etiology, patient specific factors, as well as surgeon experience and comfort.

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^b7e16b1a]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hair transplantation surgery is a popular cosmetic surgery used to combat hair loss and enhance hair appearance. From its inception in the 1950s, the procedure has not only gained tremendous popularity but has also naturally evolved with various techniques. The original procedure, Punch Hair Transplantation, involved "punching out" sections of hair follicles—hence the name—for transplantation. In the 1990s, a more sophisticated technique emerged known as the follicular unit hair transplant (FUT). This method involved excising hair-bearing strips from the donor, dissecting follicular units, and then transplanting these units to the desired site on the patient. Furthermore, follicular unit extraction (FUE), the most recent of the techniques, involves the precise and meticulous extraction of individual hair follicles, which are then implanted to complete the transplantation.

Since its introduction and subsequent rise in popularity, FUE has become a sought-after option for patients desiring hair transplantation. That said, both FUT and FUE have proven effective, though each possesses its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, FUE gained popularity partly because it offers similar outcomes without leaving significant scars. However, being a more detailed procedure, it is also more time-consuming, might necessitate multiple sessions, and can be more expensive. FUT alleviates some of these disadvantages, but patients might face a longer post-operative recovery period and have a more noticeable scar. As with all surgical procedures, both come with inherent risks and benefits tailored to individual patient characteristics. Aspects such as patient age, area of concern, hair styles, and scalp laxity should also be factored in.

### The art of repair in surgical hair restoration part I: basic repair strategies [^8a199364]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

An increasingly important part of many hair restoration practices is the correction of hair transplants that were performed using older, outdated methods, or the correction of hair transplants that have left disfiguring results. The skill and judgment involved in these repair procedures often exceed those needed to operate on patients who have had no prior surgery. The use of small grafts alone does not protect the patient from poor work. Errors in surgical and aesthetic judgment, performing procedures on noncandidate patients, and the failure to communicate successfully with patients about realistic expectations remain major problems.

Objective

This two-part series presents new insights into repair strategies and expands upon several techniques previously described in the hair restoration literature. The focus is on creative aesthetic solutions to solve the supply/demand limitations inherent in most repairs. This article is written to serve as a guide for surgeons who perform repairs in their daily practices.

Methods

The repairs are performed by excision with reimplantation and/or by camouflage. Follicular unit transplantation is used for the restorative aspects of the procedure.

Results

Using punch or linear excision techniques allows the surgeon to relocate poorly planted grafts to areas that are more appropriate. In special situations, removal of grafts without reimplantation can be accomplished using lasers or electrolysis. The key elements of camouflage include creating a deep zone of follicular units, angling grafts in their natural direction, and using forward and side weighting of grafts to increase the appearance of fullness. The available donor supply is limited by hair density, scalp laxity, and scar placement.

Conclusion

Presented with significant cosmetic problems and severely limited donor reserves, the surgeon performing restorative hair transplantation work faces distinct challenges. Meticulous surgical techniques and optimal utilization of a limited hair supply will enable the surgeon to achieve the best possible cosmetic results for patients requiring repairs.

### Guidelines on hair restoration for east Asian patients [^9d465579]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In East Asian countries, hair transplantation is a quite common procedure for treating pattern hair loss, cosmetically correcting the hairline, and correcting eyebrow and pubic hair defects. Although there are general guidelines concerning hair transplantation, certain factors need to be addressed to make the guidelines more specific and suitable to East Asian requirements.

Objective

To provide guidelines for hairline design, donor harvesting, graft preparation and placement, and medical treatment that are appropriate for hair transplantation in East Asian patients.

Methods

Recommendations are based on the experience of the authors, surgeons who perform hair transplantation, and a comprehensive review of the available literature on hair transplantation in East Asians.

Results

Data on hair thickness and graft density, hairline design, and graft creation and placement techniques have been collaboratively evaluated and used to establish overall guidelines.

Conclusion

The use of the proposed guidelines by surgeons will hopefully enhance outcomes and bring greater consistency to hair transplantation procedures for East Asian patients.

### Hair transplanting: an important but often forgotten treatment for female pattern hair loss [^82b77320]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The techniques used in the early days of hair transplanting were not suitable for the treatment of a majority of women with pattern hair loss. For at least the last 10 years, changes in those techniques have resulted in a reversal of that situation. Today, many women with female pattern hair loss are suitable candidates for transplanting, however, this is not widely appreciated. This article provides potential explanations for this and demonstrates examples of the current methods. Hair transplanting should be considered as a potential treatment option for most women with pattern hair loss.

### Hair loss and hair restoration in women [^84214cdc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Hair restoration in women involves mastering both the medical and the surgical treatment. Preoperatively, women should be thoroughly evaluated for biochemical causes of hair loss along with a complete history and physical examination taken. The physician must recognize the clinical presentation of scarring alopecias and maintain a low threshold for biopsy to rule out this condition. Postoperative hair shock loss is a common feature following hair transplant in women, and the surgeon should understand the preoperative counseling and preventative measures needed, the intraoperative methods to reduce the incidence, and the postoperative strategies to handle the situation.

### Natural asymmetry in hair growth direction: implications for hairline design in male patients [^04f8fe6d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Hair transplant surgeons are tasked with creating a hairline that is both aesthetically pleasing and natural in appearance. However, patients often assume that perfect symmetry between the right and left sides of the hairline is a prerequisite for achieving these goals. This assumption disregards a fundamental characteristic of human anatomy—facial structures, including the hairline, are rarely symmetrical.Designing a hairline that respects the natural asymmetry of hair growth results in more natural-looking outcomes, as it complements the patient’s inherent facial features.

Hair growth direction, particularly in the hairline region, is influenced by various factors, including the rotational dynamics of the hair whorl and the positioning of the part line.Typically, hairlines exhibit a rightward skew, after a clockwise rotation due to the natural whorl pattern.Ignoring these patterns during hairline design can lead to an artificial appearance, potentially disappointing patients who expect a symmetrical result.

This study seeks to quantify the degree of natural asymmetry in hairline direction among male subjects. By doing so, we aim to provide a basis for educating patients on the importance of embracing natural asymmetry in hairline designs, ultimately improving the aesthetic outcomes of hair transplant surgery.

### The allures and the alarms of the hair transplant tourism industry [^fcfb5fb4]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hair transplant tourism has surged globally, with Turkey, especially Istanbul, becoming the epicenter, generating about US$1 billion annually. This growth is fueled by substantially lower costs and appealing all-inclusive packages, leading patients to prioritize perceived value despite associated risks abroad.

Objectives

This review critically examines the multifaceted international hair transplant industry, using Turkey as a case study. We aim to analyze economic drivers and the perception that high surgical volume equates to expertise, against significant patient safety concerns.

Methods

A comprehensive review of existing literature and reports was conducted. We documented trends including aggressive digital marketing, the expanded role of unsupervised technicians, bait and switch practices, and alarming complication rates reported by regulatory bodies, which burden patients' home healthcare systems.

Results

While the hair transplant tourism industry can offer effective solutions and high graft survival in some centers, it primarily operates within a permissive regulatory environment, lacking standardization, oversight, and consistent reporting, creating a "data black hole." This, combined with the psychological distress of hair loss and the false perception of transplantation as minor, creates profound patient vulnerability, intensified by marketing campaigns that downplay risks.

Conclusions

While the industry offers affordable pathways, regulatory gaps and quality variability introduce substantial risks. Prospective patients should recognize that significant price variations may correlate with differences in resources, surgeon experience, technology, and safety protocols. Urgent development of international standards, robust verification, transparent reporting, and comprehensive patient education are imperative for patient safety and the ethical growth of this rapidly expanding medical tourism sector.

### Recipient area hair direction and angle in hair transplanting [^38917f81]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of recommendations for creating "natural" hair directions and angles in hair transplanting have been described. Objective. A method of accomplishing that goal is outlined.

Methods

Hair direction and angle are determined by multiple partings of the hair during the course of making recipient sites. Incisions are made to mimic such directions and angles. The direction is usually somewhat coronal and the use of grafts containing more than one follicular unit is particularly advantageous in producing a denser appearance.

Results

If the above technique is employed, one does not accelerate the rate at which existing hair in the recipient area is lost and the hair flows in a natural easy to manage fashion.

Conclusion

Surgeons should nearly always mimic the scalp hair directions and angles seen in nature.

### The art of repair in surgical hair restoration – part II: the tactics of repair [^ea04a13c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

As patient awareness of new hair transplantation techniques grows, the repair of improperly planned or poorly executed procedures becomes an increasingly important part of surgical hair restoration.

Objective

Part II of this series is written to serve as a practical guide for surgeons who perform repairs in their daily practices. It focuses on specific repair techniques.

Methods

The repairs are performed by excision with reimplantation and/or by camouflage. Follicular unit transplantation is used for the restorative aspects of the procedure.

Results

Using punch or linear excision techniques allows the surgeon to relocate poorly planted grafts to areas that are more appropriate. The key elements of camouflage include creating a deep zone of follicular units, angling grafts in their natural direction, and using forward and side weighting of grafts to increase the appearance of fullness. In special situations, removal of grafts without reimplantation can be accomplished using lasers or electrolysis.

Conclusion

Meticulous surgical techniques and optimal utilization of a limited hair supply will enable the surgeon to achieve the best possible cosmetic results for patients requiring repairs.

### Follicular unit transplantation: 2005 [^1238763a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

The recognition that the follicular unit is a discrete, anatomic and physiologic entity, and that preserving it through stereomicroscopic dissection is the best way to ensure the naturalness of the restoration, has brought hair transplantation into the twenty-first century. Issues yet to be resolved include determining the maximum density and number of grafts that can be used safely in a single session, deciding whether it is preferable to premake recipient sites or immediately place grafts into sites as they are made, and defining the precise role of follicular unit extraction. The essence of providing the best care for patients rests on proper patient selection, establishing realistic expectations, and using nonsurgical management for young persons who are just starting to thin.

### Megasessions: surgical indications and technical perspectives [^2320bf35]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical hair restoration allows male and female patients to achieve aesthetically natural results. The term megasession refers to transplanting greater then 3000 follicular unit grafts in a single procedure. By transplanting a large number of grafts, megasessions are capable of definitively treating a significant area of the scalp in 1 session. Patients must be carefully selected to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for an extended procedure. An experienced and well-organized surgical team is mandatory to meet the demands of this technically challenging and lengthy procedure. This article reviews the indications, contraindications, and technical perspectives surrounding megasession hair transplantation.

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^6395a006]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This bibliometric review provides an important roadmap to the most influential publications regarding hair transplantation. Our analysis highlights the transformative work of authors Rassman and Bernstein, the emergence of follicular unit extraction as a groundbreaking procedure. More importantly, it identifies a shift in focus toward alternative uses and novel approaches in hair transplantation post-2011. The US emerged as a significant contributor to high-impact hair transplantation research, with notable institutions such as Cornell University, Columbia University, and New Hair Institute leading the quest. However, the analysis also revealed a critical need for contemporary high-level evidence-based research. It is apparent that many influential studies were found to have lower levels of evidence. While this review offers valuable insights into the field's evolution, it also underscores the ongoing need for the pursuit of high-quality, innovative research to further advance the understanding and practice of hair transplantation and continue to advance patient satisfaction and our clinical outcomes.

### Factors associated with musculoskeletal pain among hair transplant surgeons: analyses of survey data and review of the literature [^86686097]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD) is increasing among all surgical specialties.

Objective

Results of a cross-sectional survey of hair transplant surgeons were analyzed, with the aims to (1) determine the prevalence of WRMD, (2) assess risk factors associated with musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms, and (3) identify mitigation measures.

Materials and Methods

A survey pertaining to demographics, MSK-related symptoms and its impacts, and pain mitigation measures taken, if any, were distributed to 834 hair transplant surgeons. Risk factors associated with pain severity were assessed using linear regression.

Results

Overall, 78.5% (73 of 93) respondents had experienced pain when performing surgery. Musculoskeletal symptoms were most severe in the neck, followed by upper/lower back, and extremities. Number of grafts performed per session of follicular unit extraction positively correlated with pain severity; female surgeons and surgeons aged >71 years were at higher risk. A majority expressed concern that WRMD may limit their career and agreed to a need for improved workplace education. Strength training and ergonomic improvements of surgical procedure were not commonly adopted.

Conclusion

In sum, WRMD can be debilitating in health care professionals. Workplace ergonomic adjustments and physical exercise programs may be warranted to better mitigate MSK symptoms.

### Hair transplantation: state of the art [^8e9cccbe]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hair transplantation is a minimally invasive procedure for treating hair loss in men and women, based on the principle of donor dominance, where transplanted hair retains its genetic characteristics in new locations. It is primarily used for androgenetic alopecia but also can be used in end-stage cicatricial alopecia and as a corrective procedure post-trauma or surgery.

Objective

This review provides an overview of the current status of hair transplant surgery in the last 5 years, as well as a guide for patient selection, technical considerations, instrumentation, and postoperative care.

Methods/Materials

A review was conducted of the PubMed database between 2019 and 2024 and included 1,030 study abstracts.

Results

Follicular unit extraction and (linear strip) excision are both state of the art methods for hair transplantation. New devices have been developed for extraction and insertion of follicular units. Thoughtful hairline design and concurrent medical management have improved aesthetic results.

Conclusion

Hair transplantation has experienced a surge in popularity due to advances in devices, techniques, and medical therapies to maintain hair density, leading to long-lasting, natural results and high patient satisfaction. Future directions include improvements in instrumentation, artificial intelligence, hair follicle cloning, and enhanced adjuvant medical management.

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^0d7d5e04]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Advancement in knowledge, technology, and surgical technique within the field of hair transplantation continues to promote better patient outcomes and minimize risks. Hair transplantation effectively improves the quality of life of patients suffering from various types of alopecia (e.g. androgenetic alopecia) and scarring caused by trauma or surgery. Indications continue to expand. By performing a bibliometric review on “hair transplant,” we identified the most-cited publications on the topic. Although this type of analysis makes it difficult to determine the quality of a publication, it quantitatively measures the level of influence that certain hair transplant publications have had on the scientific literature and, ultimately, clinical practice. This analysis aims to serve as a tool for surgeons, clinicians, and researchers to quickly identify the top-cited articles on hair transplantation rather than having to sift through the over 4000 published articles that exist today. Altogether, the top 50 publications on hair transplantation included for analysis have amassed over 1300 citations and serve as a snapshot for the most discussed ideas within the field. On average, the number of citations per publication included in our study, 26.82, is relatively low when compared to similar studies. For reference, bibliometric reviews analyzing facial rejuvenation, facial plastic surgery, and classic plastic surgery studies had average citation rates of 138, 150, and 859, respectively. This may be attributed to the fact that these bibliometric reviews covered broader topics and/or publications that have been in circulation for a longer period of time and thus have amassed higher citation counts. This further highlights the relative novelty of hair transplantation surgery.

It is interesting to note the temporal evolution in topics of popular hair transplant manuscripts. Articles published in earlier years tended to consist of expert opinion, surgical technique, and treatment guidelines for conventional hair restoration. Content aimed to improve graft survival, promote ideal esthetic results, characterize optimal graft sizes, and provide general standardization to hair transplant procedures. Logically, this content established the foundation from which the field of research surrounding hair transplantation could emerge. Using number of citations as a measure of influence, the present study demonstrates that newer publications pertaining to hair transplant surgery have been more influential. In general, one might expect for older publications to have higher citation rates. After all, the longer a publication has been in circulation, the more likely it is to be cited. However, the opposite seems to be true when examining hair transplantation research, a result that may be explained by the content of newer studies.

### Hair transplantation: basic overview [^a999fa5f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Modern hair restoration surgery is based on a technique known as follicular unit transplantation, in which follicular units are the exclusive structures used as hair grafts. In Part 1 of this 2-part review, we describe how the techniques employed in hair transplantation have evolved into their present forms. Anatomic concepts of specific relevance for dermatologists are discussed, including the distribution and ex vivo morphology of scalp follicular units. Male androgenetic alopecia and female pattern hair loss are the most common reasons for hair loss consultations with dermatologists and will be the primary focus of this review. However, because not all hair disorders are suitable for transplantation, this review will also describe which scalp conditions are amenable to surgery and which are not. Guidelines are provided to help dermatologists better define good and bad candidates for hair transplantation. Other conditions for which hair transplantation surgery is indicated are reviewed.

### Robotic hair transplantation [^ead89bee]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Contemporary hair transplant surgery creates natural appearing transplanted hair. The procedure is performed as an outpatient under local anesthesia. Donor harvesting can be performed by either elliptical donor harvesting or follicular unit extraction. An experience surgical team is needed for a high-quality, efficient procedure. Robotic hair transplantation allows precise and efficient removal of follicular units. The robot allows for minimally invasive surgery. Robotic hair transplantation is an important tool for hair transplant surgeons, but does not replace appropriate candidate selection, hairline design, and the judgment of where to place and not place transplanted hair for optimal short- and long-term results.

### Hair transplantation controversies [^5ed2e724]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hair transplant surgery creates consistently natural appearing transplanted hair for men. It is increasingly popular procedure to restore natural growing hair for men with hair loss.

Objective

To review some current controversies in hair transplant surgery.

Materials and Methods

Review of the English PubMed literature and specialty literature in hair transplant surgery.

Results

Some of the controversies in hair transplant surgery include appropriate donor harvesting technique including elliptical donor harvesting versus follicular unit extraction whether manual versus robotic, the role of platelet-rich plasma and low-level light surgery in hair transplant surgery.

Conclusion

Hair transplant surgery creates consistently natural appearing hair. As with all techniques, there are controversies regarding the optimal method for performing the procedure. Some of the current controversies in hair transplant surgery include optimal donor harvesting techniques, elliptical donor harvesting versus follicular unit extraction, the role of low-level light therapy and the platelet-rich plasma therapy in the procedure. Future studies will further clarify their role in the procedure.

### Beard hair transplantation [^2ff29a17]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

In the field of hair restoration, there has been a significant increase in demand with patients for facial hair transplantation procedures. Modern techniques in hair transplantation allow for facial hair transplantation and for the attainment of natural-appearing results. Facial hair transplantation is a subspecialty within hair restoration with many gratifying benefits for the patients as well as for the hair restoration surgeon. Adapting these advanced techniques into a hair restoration practice allows a surgeon to offer their patients these procedures and provides an expanded artistic element to a hair restoration surgeon's practice.

### Complications in hair restoration [^027e7af1]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Hair restoration requires a high level of specialized skill on the part of both the surgeon and the assistant team. Recipient-site problems can manifest from either surgeon or assistant error. The surgeon can create an unnatural hairline due to lack of knowledge of natural hair-loss patterns or badly executed recipient sites. He must also be cognizant of how hairs naturally are angled on the scalp to re-create a pattern that appears natural when making recipient sites. Assistants can also greatly contribute to the success or failure of surgery in their task of graft dissection and graft placement.

### Complications in hair-restoration surgery [^25a81053]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Most complications associated with hair restoration are completely preventable and arise from variables that are directly controlled by the surgeon and the patient. Physicians who thoroughly grasp the nuances of modern surgical techniques and fully understand the physiologic dynamics of the balding process are least likely to generate a physician-controlled error. Highly motivated, well-educated patients who carefully follow instructions and take an active role in the postoperative recovery process minimize the chance of patient-controlled errors. This article discusses potential complications associated with surgical hair restoration, and the roles of the patient and physician in minimizing the risk of complications.

### Summary of best evidence for perioperative management practices in hair transplantation patients: facial skeleton [^408cab37]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To integrate and summarize the best evidence on perioperative management practices for hair transplantation patients, providing an evidence-based reference for clinical.

Methods

An exhaustive literature search was conducted to identify the best evidence for managing patients undergoing hair transplantation during the perioperative period. The databases searched included Up To Date, BMJ Best Practice, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, National Guideline Clearing House, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, Guidelines International Network, Cochrane Library, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, PubMed, Web of Science, European Dermatology Forum, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Medlive Guideline Network, and Sinomed. The search spanned publications from February 2013 to February 2024, focusing on clinical decisions, evidence summaries, guidelines, and expert consensus.

Results

We finally identified 22 articles with high-quality results (consisting of 9 clinical decisions, 6 guidelines, 7 expert consensuses), providing 41 pieces of evidence across seven categories: assessment of transplantation conditions, transplant planning and preoperative preparation, anesthetic preparations, surgical methods and operation skills, postoperative wound management, medication-related guidance, optimization of nursing and treatment strategies. Special emphasis has been placed on the sections covering anesthesia preparation, surgical methods, and operational techniques, with detailed explanations provided.

Conclusion

The summarized best evidence on perioperative management practices for hair transplantation patients can serve as evidence-based guidelines for clinical. It is recommended that clinical staff adopt evidence-based recommendations to improve and optimize patient outcomes and promote postoperative recovery. As these evidences came from different countries, factors such as the clinical environment should be evaluated before application.

### Follicular unit excision: current practice and future developments [^e8eafd07]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Hair transplantation, or hair restoration surgery (HRS) remains the only method to consistently restore hair in those experiencing pattern hair loss as well as hair loss from most other causes. HRS has been significantly improved with the development of follicular unit extraction, later renamed follicular unit excision, or FUE. This allows the surgeon to harvest grafts from the donor area without leaving a scar. FUE can also be used to harvest grafts from other areas of the body. When performed properly using the most technically advanced devices, the transection of the grafts with FUE remains under 4%.

### Overexpression of nanog in amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells accelerates dermal papilla cell activity and promotes hair follicle regeneration [^bec255b8]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alopecia, the general medical term for hair loss or baldness, is a distressing condition caused by complex factors, including genetic, hormonal, iatrogenic, and traumatic events. Although alopecia is not a life-threatening disease, it is associated with a variety of negative psychosocial impacts in sufferers. In particular, androgenetic alopecia, which is characterized by progressive miniaturization of hair follicles (HFs), occurs in 50% of menopausal women, 35% of women of childbearing age, and 70% of adult men. Despite its high prevalence, the approved therapeutic options are limited to several oral and topical agents, and patients’ expectations are much higher than the reality. Hair transplantation is the second-best option for alopecia patients who do not have success with medical therapies; however, previous studies reported conflicting results due to differences in techniques, skill levels of the surgeons who performed the transplant, and characteristics of the patients. Moreover, such operations cannot be performed more than three times on the same patient. Accordingly, increased attention has been paid to developing satisfactory first-line treatments.

### Reducing surgical risks for hair replacement surgery [^52c208b7]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hair loss is a common problem among men and women. Hair replacement surgery (HRS) has become increasingly popular as technological advancements have been made producing remarkably natural results when performed by a skilled surgeon. Although complications from HRS are low compared with other esthetic surgeries, they can still occur even with the best-trained and qualified surgeon or staff. The process of hair restoration can be a long road for some patients and active patient participation and education is key for successful results. In this article, we seek to discuss the surgical risks of HRS and discuss methods to prevent them in your practice.

### Hairline-lowering surgery [^8a2b73b9]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

As an alternative to hair transplantation for lowering the overly high hairline, hairline-lowering/forehead-reduction surgery has several advantages, including unsurpassed density and immediate results. Appropriate candidates for this surgery must have a stable frontal hairline (thus excluding most men) and a fairly to very mobile scalp that will permit sufficient advancement to warrant this more "invasive" approach. The main objective of this surgery is the lowering of the hairline. The authors' surgical approach, which was developed over the performance of more than 90 of these procedures and produces consistent results with low rates of complications, is described.

### PRECISE scale: a quantitative classification for androgenetic alopecia and its application to hair transplantation [^6658bf90]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

When evaluating such classifications, we noticed limitations in terms of detailed description, practicality for clinical assessment, and reproducibility of classification. Moreover, different patients with the same class of baldness on traditional scales, could obtain a poor aesthetical outcome in the post-procedure if approached with the same surgical strategy. This is because those classifications are essentially qualitative and lack features needed to make a proper strategy for the hair restoration.

Another fact to be considered is that there is a relevant level of divergence between the examiners when using those qualitative classifications. In other words, a single patient can be classified in different classes by different professionals using the same scale; and a mathematical classification could minimize such disagreements. Thus, a proper measurement of the area to be implanted can decisively influence the results of the hair transplantation (HT), a fact that may be even more relevant when considering professionals who are beginners in the hair restoration field. For the experienced surgeons, a quantitative classification may further improve their surgical planning leading to results of the utmost excellence.

The present work aims to propose a mathematical classification of AGA, through a quantitative evaluation. The PRECISE classification is based mainly on the areas that need to be restored. It brings, in a simple way, mathematics to assist the surgical planning. Ultimately, the new scale has potential to result in a precise hair restoration planning and function as an essential parameter for either in-person or telemedicine assessments.

### Body hair transplant by follicular unit extraction: my experience with 122 patients [^9465e8e9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Hair Transplantation Technique

Body hair transplantation was accomplished using FUE techniques previously described.In general, approximately 1500 to 1800 grafts can be transplanted during an 8- to 9-hour operation day, divided into 2 blocks of time: graft extraction and placement of grafts in their intended recipient areas. Consequently, planning is required in terms of scheduling once the number of grafts required has been estimated. Although back-to-back operational days can be scheduled when required, patient availability and tolerance are factors as is the target density issue for those patients at risk for scalp necrosis in which hair density in a recipient area is built up over a long period time (several sessions over 6-12 months).

A versatile orthopedic table that can accommodate lateral tilt, normal and reverse Trendelenberg positions, height adjustments, and head and neck maneuverability, at a minimum, is recommended.A table with leg-splitting capabilities is also useful when leg hair extractions are to be performed. Each session starts with the surgeon mapping out the extraction and recipient areas and approximately how many hair shafts will be extracted from each donor area. If scalp hair is to be extracted in the session, this is done first prior to any body hair extraction.

### Evaluation indicators of aesthetic effects on hair transplantation [^1cdf9baa]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of recorded history, hair has been one of the cornerstones of the human concept of beauty and strength. Other than historical differences in style, a thick, full head of hair has always been associated with youth, vitality, strength, and pulchritude. Thus, hair loss can have significant psychosocial manifestations. Consequently, the baldness treatment industry is worth billions of dollars worldwide annually.Although there are now several approved pharmacologic options to prevent hair loss, hair transplantation (HTS) is still the most effective method to treat hair loss.

To date, HTS has a history of nearly 210 years, which involves the transplantation of hair, beard, eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair; however, HTS is also a relatively tedious surgical procedure, involving the evaluation and design of the recipient site, selection of the donor area, the calculation of hair follicle (HF) number, separation and preservation of HFs, and the process of HF implantation. Each of these steps is closely related to the visual postoperative effects. Based on our experience, the aesthetic result of HTS mainly relies on some indicators, including selection of the donor site, direction and angle of grafted hairs, density, and survival rate of implanted HFs. (1) Selection of the donor site: body hairs are not usually a donor area. For HTS, beard, pubic hair, and chest HTS, regardless of the texture of hair, the occiput is usually chosen as a donor. For eyelash and eyebrow implantation, we usually select hairs with a texture that approximates the eyelashes or eyebrows, such as hairline hair of the periauricular area or nape. For patients with curly hair, we do not transplant eyelashes or eyebrows. (2) Direction and angle of grafting hair: the surgeon is the main factor influencing the growth direction of implanted hair. To achieve a natural appearance, HFs should be implanted according to the natural direction of hair growth. For scalp hair, over the frontal to mid-scalp area, the hairs are in an anterior or forward direction with acute angulation. Over the temples and parietal area, the direction is more inferoposterior with very acute angles, especially over the temple points and sideburn areas, which have angles almost flat to the skin. The vertex area can be a complicated area to transplant because hairs may follow a whorl pattern. For eyebrows, the shape of the eyebrow appears like a sword with a linear base. The upper part of the eyebrow is bowed with a pointed tail. The medial and distal ends are essentially in the same horizontal line, except in younger individuals, in whom the lateral end is slightly higher. Insertion of the grafts is crucial. When the needle is inserted, the direction in the superior edge of the medial one-third will be directed down below to the brow axis instead of upward, as in the normal anatomy. In addition, the needle is inserted in an acute angle to almost flat to the skin. (3) Density of implanted hair: for East Asians, the density of scalp hair is approximately 75 follicles/cm 2.000000000000000e+00 For scalp, to achieve a normal appearance, 35 to 40 grafts/cm 2 are usually implanted for the hairline and frontal region, and 50 to 60 grafts/cm 2 are usually grafted for the parietal region. Other areas, however, such as the eyebrows and eyelashes, are usually required to achieve normal density. Factors affecting the density of HTS also include the patient and surgeon. For the patient, HTS can achieve normal hair density using an appropriate slitting technique, except for the recipient site with atrophic scars and subcutaneous soft tissue loss. For the surgeon, on the premise of ensuring the survival of implanted hair, using different punch tools is the key. In terms of the size of the slits, generally, grafts with 1 hair correspond to slits created by a 20- to 21-gauge hypodermic needle or 0.7 to 0.9 mm mini blades, and 2- to 3-hair grafts correspond to slits created by 18- to 19-gauge needles or 1.0 to 1.1 mm mini blades. Based on our experience, using the slitting needle with 1 mm or 0.8 mm diameter can usually achieve a better density. (4) Survival rate of implanted hair: The survival rate of HFs is mainly influenced both by patients and surgeons. For the patient, in addition to atrophic scars, other local factors usually do not affect the survival of transplanted hair. For the surgeon, if the surgeon has more than 3 years of experience in HTS and the harvested HFs can be stored at 4°C or 0°C Ringer solution in vitro, the survival rate of HFs is usually up to 90%.

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^6c06b9d5]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

On April 7, 2023, Clarivate’s Web of Science database was used to obtain the data that were analyzed in this study. Search query “follicular unit transplantation” OR “follicular unit extraction” AND “hair” under all topics was used and yielded a total of 260 publications. Only publications available in English were analyzed. Publications were then sorted via number of citations, in descending order from highest to lowest count. Then, the data were exported to an Excel sheet for further analysis. On the offline Excel sheet, each publication was reviewed and included in the final list only if it fell under the scope of the project. In order to be included in the top 50 analysis, the publications had to pertain to hair transplantation surgery. Once the 50 most-cited publications were ascertained, they were moved to a separate sheet for further review.

Initially, the PubMedID’s of the 50 publications included in the review were copied and searched under the Web of Science database. This search query was analyzed by the citation report function to provide an overview of the 50 publications. Affiliated institutions, country of origin, authorship, year of publication, and publishing journal were also obtained for each of the publications. Lastly, each publication was reviewed and assigned a Level of Evidence (LOE) and a classifying topic. LOE was determined by Oxford’s level of evidence rating and was determined as follows:

1 = Systematic reviews of randomized trials or systematic reviews of inception cohort studies.

2 = Systematic reviews of cohort studies, inception cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized trials, or observational studies with dramatic effect.

3 = Cohort studies (primarily retrospective), epidemiological/observational study.

4 = Case-control studies, low-impact cohort studies, animal trials.

5 = Simulations, models, or mechanism-based reasoning.

Classification of article topics was determined by the authors of the papers as follows: alternative use, anatomy/biology/basic science, expert opinion, novel approach, outcome, population statistics, review, surgical technique, and/or treatment guidelines. Lastly, publications were also assessed for their citation density, which was the frequency cited per year since being published.

### Surgical complications in hair transplantation: a series of 533 procedures [^4fb6f879]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical complications in hair transplantation can sometimes be a serious matter. Most of the published literature on this issue deals with individual case reports rather than larger series of patients.

Objective

The authors analyze complications in 425 consecutive patients undergoing 533 hair transplantations.

Methods

Patients with androgenetic alopecia (407 men and 17 women), cicatricial alopecia (9 men and 8 women), and malformations (1 man and 3 women) with a mean age of 36.9 years (standard deviation, 10.4 yrs) underwent hair transplantation between 1995 and 2006 and were followed up postoperatively for at least 1 year. Data on surgical complications were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The overall complication rate in our series was 4.7%, including enlarged scar (1.2%), folliculitis (1.0%), necrosis in the donor area (0.8%), keloids (0.4%), bleeding (0.2%), hiccups (0.2%), infection (0.2%), and pyogenic granuloma (0.2%). The frequency of enlarged scar increased proportionally according to the number of surgical procedures.

Conclusions

The hair transplantation complication rate in this series was 4.7%. Good communication between patient and surgeon, a complete clinical and laboratory assessment of the patient, accurate surgical technique, specific equipment, a trained surgical team, and careful postoperative attention to the patient are crucial for successful hair transplantation and for decreasing complication rates.).

### Body hair transplant by follicular unit extraction: my experience with 122 patients [^e86df49f]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The 6 BHT patients in whom no head or beard donor sources were used (ie, only hairs from any 1 or more of trunk, limbs, armpits, and pubic hair were used as donor sources) generally provided marginally lower scores (7.1 for donor healing and 6.9 for growth rate) However, in terms of overall satisfaction with the results, these patients were nearly as equally satisfied (mean score, 8.0) as their counterparts in whom their BHT also involved the utilization of beard, head, or NPA counterparts (mean score, 8.3).

The major limitations to the use of BHT in hair restoration (compared with traditional use of scalp hair as a sole donor source) are that the procedure is longer and more costly, requires a higher surgical skill level and specialized equipment and instruments, may result in lower quality outcomes, and is not an option in nonhairy individuals.In particular, it is worth noting that while the overall graft take using SDA/NPA is about 95%, for BHT it is around 75%-80%. It is also relatively labor intensive and, given the complexity and delicate nature of the procedure, the applicability of robotic options seems less likely in the near future.

### Basic hair transplantation: 2007 [^4b3ebd5f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

The most common form of hair loss is androgenic alopecia that affects at least half of the male population by age 50 is speculated to be caused by a change in the balance of androgen hormones. Male hair loss occurs in a characteristic pattern of decreased hair growth where hair becomes progressively finer, less pigmented, ceasing growth completely, and then becoming dislodged from the scalp. Hair loss to some patients is a serious issue that can impart a social and psychologic impact on their life. Hair restoration and transplantation have the potential to provide a solution for this problem; however, it is not effective for every patient. This review article looks at past hair transplantation techniques and studies that have provided the basis for current procedures and new research at how to target successful results.

### Contemporary hair transplantation [^37494bbf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The field of hair transplantation has evolved considerably over the last quarter century. Performed correctly, the cosmetic results of contemporary hair transplantation are virtually undetectable in women and men. Large, pluggy "punch grafts" have been replaced with natural-appearing follicular unit grafts, which maintain their existing anatomy and with proper technique can match the orientation of surrounding hair follicles.

Objective

To review all of the steps involved in hair transplantation surgery and to provide an overview of medications used in conjunction with transplantation to help prevent hair loss.

Materials, Methods, and Results

The authors review key aspects of the consultation, physical examination, selection of appropriate candidates, excision of donor area, hairline design, graft creation and placement, and postoperative instructions. The role of medications such as minoxidil and finasteride in preventing ongoing hair loss is an essential part of the treatment plan. For nonsurgical candidates, other treatments such as wigs, hairpieces, and camouflages are reviewed. Future trends may involve the use of low-level laser light therapy, dutasteride, and cloning of follicles.

Conclusion

Patients and physicians alike are pleased with the results of contemporary hair transplantation, and physicians can now recommend the procedure without reservation. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Current practices and controversies in cosmetic hair restoration [^2ec4e5e0]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hair restoration surgery has evolved into a scientifically based cosmetic surgical discipline over the last half century. A recent hair surgical technique to evolve, Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), is a donor harvesting technique removing single "follicular units "one unit at a time" with a small round punch.

Objective

Describe the origins, current practices and controversies in hair restoration surgery; and challenges in adopting donor harvesting with the FUE technique.

Materials and Methods

The medical literature is reviewed in regards to the improvements in surgical hair restoration techniques. Publicly available direct marketing campaigns, promotional material, and Internet advertising of certain FUE devices are reviewed.

Results

After two decades of technique improvement cosmetic outcomes with hair restoration surgery are observed with FUE and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) techniques. Although FUT remains the gold standard in hair restoration surgery, FUE has clinically demonstrated comparable patient outcomes and satisfaction. Certain FUE device manufacturers market the illegal concept of expanding the hair technicians role hair restoration surgery.

Conclusion

FUE is a complementary and satisfactory donor harvesting method to FUT. The evolving trend for new or inexperienced surgeons to delegate partial or total surgical care and clinical oversight to non-licensed is discussed.

### Beard and body hair transplantation by follicular unit excision using a skin-responsive device: a multicenter study [^909e9d39]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

At ≧6-month follow-up, 79.1% of 43 patients rated their outcome as “very happy,” while 20.9% found it “satisfactory.” Of the 4 surgeons, all had expertise in performing beard FUE, and all but 1 had expertise with body FUE. The willingness to perform beard FUE increased from 3.67 to 5.00 and 2.33 to 5.00 for body FUE.

The SFRD consistently achieved a <7% TR in nonscalp hair transplantation, marking a significant improvement over previous methods. The lower TR in beard FUE, as opposed to body FUE, may be attributed to its closer resemblance to scalp hair. The generally reduced TR and improved surgeon receptivity are likely because of the SFRD's MAN capability. The strength of this study lies in its multicenter approach and diverse surgeon experiences, although limitations include its retrospective nature and small sample size.

### The potential role of minoxidil in the hair transplantation setting [^ac482fa8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last decade surgical management of hair loss has become an increasingly popular and satisfying procedure for both men and women, as innovations in donor harvesting, graft size, and hairline design have resulted in consistently natural-appearing hair restoration.

Objective

In addition, a better understanding of the regulation of the hair-growth cycle has led to advances in the pharmacologic treatment of androgenetic alopecia.

Methods

Currently there are two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents that promote hair regrowth: over-the-counter topical minoxidil solution for men and women and prescription oral finasteride tablets for men. In October 2001, a group of 11 international experts on hair loss and hair transplantation convened to review the physiology and effects of pharmacologic treatments of hair loss and to discuss the value of administering topical minoxidil therapy as an adjunct to hair transplantation.

Results

This article presents the key findings and consensus points among the participants, including their current use of pharmacologic treatments, strategies for optimal results both pre- and postsurgery, and the importance of realistic patient expectations and compliance.

Conclusions

Based on the surgeons' clinical experience, the use of approved hair regrowth agents in hair transplant patients with viable but suboptimally functioning follicles in the region to be transplanted can increase hair density, speed regrowth in transplanted follicles, and complement the surgical result by slowing down or stopping further hair loss.

### Follicular unit transplantation: dissecting and planting techniques [^8285e1fc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

FUT was designed to move hair from the donor area to the recipient area in such a way as to duplicate naturally occurring hair and to minimize trauma to the follicles in the process. With the exception of a few factors such as the "vellus blush" of the frontal hairline or the anterior temples, FUT can accomplish these goals. This article has outlined the basic requirements for the dissection and implantation of follicular unit grafts and provided evidence provided by research data, where it exists, to support the contentions and requirements of FUT. With adherence to defined standards, surgeons can accomplish certain aesthetic goals with this technique on a consistent basis.

### PRECISE scale: a quantitative classification for androgenetic alopecia and its application to hair transplantation [^cb617045]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

As for the mesh measurement it demands training to obtain the perfect 3D model and requires compatible mobile phone, tablet or a specific device. Nevertheless, it is necessary to confirm the areas measuring them again in the immediate preoperative with the use of the stamp when the patient’s head is shaved. This will allow a final refinement of the strategy.

Although the scale may guide to a total number of grafts needed for a complete hair restoration in the assessed patient, the planning on how to achieve this number of grafts is up to the hair restoration surgeon. In other words, if the surgeon is facing a PRECISE class 5 he would need 7500 grafts to completely restore it. This implies in indicating 2 or 3 procedures for reaching this amount of FUs. But ultimately, the numbers of FU to be transplanted may vary slightly depending on the available resources and other nuances inherent to the patient's nature.

Of utmost importance, surgeons must also consider whether the patient has the resources (i.e. availability of hair follicles in donor areas) to achieve an ideal restoration. If the surgeon is facing a very advanced PRECISE class, he needs to consider adapting the surgical strategy to fit into the resources available, as for a complete hair restoration he would need a very large number of grafts that may not be possible to harvest in the patient donor areas. For instance, a PRECISE class 10 patient would need 15,000 grafts for a complete restoration of all the bald areas. This is such a number of grafts that is not achievable in a lot of patients, even using body hair transplant. In such situations, the surgeon should manage the patient's expectations into realistic perspectives and explain that the final achievable result may differ from what is ideal to him. This adaptation in surgical planning may include a higher hairline, no temporal restoration and intentionally transplanting low density on the crown area, for example. Consequently, marking a high hairline on a PRECISE class 10 may save 3000 grafts, or even more, from being transplanted. Therefore, a class 10 could be restored with around 12,000 grafts if the correct strategy is used.

### Facial hair transplantation for transgender patients: a literature review and guidelines for practice [^0cae6c8e]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial hair transplantation has become an increasingly popular modality to create a more masculine appearance for transmasculine patients.

Objectives

This aim of this study was to review the current literature regarding facial hair transplantation and provide recommendations and best practices for transgender patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted for studies published through April 2020 for publications discussing facial hair transplant in transmasculine patients, in addition to the nontransgender population. Data extracted include patient demographics, techniques, outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction.

Results

We identified 2 articles discussing facial hair transplantation in transmasculine patients. Due to the paucity of publications describing facial hair transplantation in transmasculine patients, data regarding facial hair transplant from the cisgender population were utilized to augment our review and recommendations.

Conclusions

Facial hair transplant is a safe and effective means of promoting a masculine appearance for transgender patients. Nevertheless, facial hair transplantation should be deferred until at least 1 year after the initiation of testosterone therapy to allow surgeons to more accurately identify regions that would benefit the most from transplantation. Additionally, providers should engage patients in discussions about any plans to undergo facial masculinization surgery because this can alter the position of transplanted hairs. Currently, follicular unit extraction from the occipital scalp is the preferred technique, with use of the temporal scalp if additional grafts are needed. Patients should be advised that a secondary grafting procedure may be needed a year after initial transplant to achieve desired density.

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^be5d33cd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Particularly after the year 2011, which happens to be the year with the highest number of influential publications, we saw an emergence of articles discussing alternative uses and novel approaches for hair transplantation. Researchers began to expand the utility of hair transplantation for new applications such as scar concealment, wound healing, and burns treatment. Three influential articles on the implementation of robotic-assisted follicular unit extraction for hair transplantation were published between 2014–2015. Prospect of enhanced precision and efficiency with robotics proved enticing for both patients and providers. Overall, the predominant topic, as illustrated by the co-occurrence visualization of publication keywords, was follicular unit extraction. This keyword is intertwined with several topics of hair transplantation research including etiology of hair loss (i.e. cicatricial alopecia and androgenic alopecia) and technique (i.e. robotic hair transplantation and follicular unit grafting). Keyword co-occurrence analysis allows one to discover nodes of the literature interests and gauge possible future research topics. From the analysis presented in the present study, follicular unit extraction is a topic that may continue to garner attention in the field of hair transplantation.

Rassman, W.R. and Bernstein, R.M. two specialists in hair restoration surgery from New York that collaborated on several manuscripts, stand out as the authors with both the highest number of total publications (n = 7) and the top three most-cited articles on hair transplantation. They also represented the largest nodes for co-citation analysis, demonstrating that their influence on the hair transplantation literature permeates through other prominent researchers in the field. They became recognized for pioneering their technique of Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). They performed thousands of “micrografts” within a single session. This seminal work refined hair transplantation and brought it into the modern era by enabling surgeons to make smaller and less invasive incisions. As a result, more follicular unit grafts could be placed within a given area. They also were notable for their contributions to patient assessment and surgical planning with consideration of esthetic results. Their works set the stage for further innovation within the field of hair transplantation.

### Follicular unit transplantation [^9f04cfd5]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Hair transplant is a powerful and reliable procedure that provides a natural and high-impact result. This procedure can be used to restore scalp hair, eyebrow hair, beard hair, body hair, or areas of hair loss due to scarring. The hair transplant techniques of the past (hair plugs, scalp reductions) have etched a negative impression of hair restoration surgery in the public memory. With the improved techniques of follicular unit transplantation, more natural and discreet results can be obtained with minimal downtime and preservation of patient privacy. This article focuses on follicular unit transplantation and performance of the strip technique.

### Follicular unit extraction in hair transplantation: personal experience [^2ea4fcf2]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Hair transplantation in the form of follicular units constitutes the cornerstone of hair-replacement surgery. Harvesting follicular units directly from the donor area by using punches is described as follicular unit extraction (FUE) technique, and it eliminates the need for excision of a hair-bearing strip. In this article, we presented our surgical approach for hair transplantation, which is based on performing follicular extraction in 2 phases: follicular unit isolation and follicular unit collection, and discussed some technical details of FUE and some advantages and disadvantages of this approach. We transplanted an average of 1651 follicular units in 1 day, 2610 follicular units in 2 days, and 3200 follicular units in 3 days.

### Development of a standardized photo guideline for online hair transplantation consultation [^b5800d23]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Telemedicine has rapidly advanced in plastic and aesthetic surgery, but obtaining high-quality images during online hair transplantation consultations remains challenging, impeding doctors' visual evaluation.

Objective

To investigate patients' attitude and satisfaction with online hair transplantation consultations, and to develop a standardized photo guideline to help patients capture high-quality images.

Methods

We surveyed patients' attitudes and satisfaction with online hair transplantation consultations from November 23, 2023 to May 3, 2024. Meanwhile, five surgeons developed a standardized photo guideline and assessed its effectiveness by comparing image quality between two patient groups: those using the photo guideline and those not using it.

Results

We collected 570 responses to the attitude questionnaire, with 76.66% of participants expressing a willingness to undergo online hair transplantation consultations. The patient satisfaction survey yielded an overall satisfaction score of 4.44±0.72 out of 5 for online hair transplantation consultations. Furthermore, all five surgeons rated photographs taken by patients following the photo guideline as higher quality compared to those taken by patients who did not use it.

Conclusion

Patients show high satisfaction with online hair transplantation consultations. The standardized photo guideline proves effective in helping patients take high-quality photographs for online consultations.

### Norman orentreich, the father of hair transplantation (...) [^61fbb014]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

For centuries, people have been attempting to find a remedy for baldness. While the origins of modern-day hair restoration stem from work done in Japan in the 1930s, it was not until several decades later that these innovations came to light in the West. Norman Orentreich, MD, a New York dermatologist, began to experiment with treatments for vitiligo and male pattern baldness at New York University’s Skin and Cancer Hospital, and in 1952 he performed the first hair transplantation surgery specifically for treating male pattern baldness. 1 He not only introduced a hair transplantation technique but also presented a physiological basis for its use. .. .

### Old friend or new ally: a comparison of follicular unit transplantation and follicular unit excision methods in hair transplantation [^aaa43255]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Follicular unit excision (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation using strip surgery (FUT) are the dominant graft harvest methods in hair transplantation. The increase in the demand for FUE has reignited the debate of the relative superiority of the 2 methods.

Objective

To present a critical comparison of FUE and FUT graft harvesting techniques.

Materials and Methods

Search of PubMed, trade publications, and printed references.

Results

Follicular unit excision and FUT methods provide high-quality grafts, but differ in their scarring patterns of the donor region. Follicular unit transplantation results in a linear scar, whereas FUE produces punctate scars that are typically easily concealed. Distinct subgroups of hair transplant patients are eligible for FUE, FUT, or both procedures.

Conlcusion

Both FUE and FUT are equally effective in generating high-quality grafts. This detailed evaluation of the FUT and FUE procedures will assist hair restoration surgeons make informed decisions about the best approach for their patients.

### PRECISE scale: a quantitative classification for androgenetic alopecia and its application to hair transplantation [^8c0e0cd0]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

One of the goals of the PRECISE scale is to estimate the number of grafts needed to obtain good coverage of the bald and thinning areas. The number of 1500 grafts for each point in the PRECISE scale is recommended. This number of grafts was calculated, as suggested by other colleagues, adopting 50 FU per cm 2 as a reasonable filling value for most regions of the scalp, which would give a density of around 100 hairs per cm 2. Naturally, the amount of 1500 FU for each point in the scale is only a guidance as this number may vary depending on the density that the surgeon wants to apply on the different zones of the scalp.

The choice for a 0-10 scale over the absolute values of the area is necessary for three main reasons:
The simplicity that a 0–10 rating scale brings to the patients' understanding of the extent of their problem;
Possibility of standardization for future research;
Translate for the hair restoration surgeon an objective goal for surgical planning other than mere qualitative assessment.

The fact that the traditionally used scales for MPHL classification are essentially qualitative makes them unsuited for an accurate hair transplantation planning. This is because they lack features needed to make an appropriate strategy for the hair restoration and may guide the surgeon to a misjudgment on the amount of grafts he will need to transplant to achieve a proper hair restoration. This becomes evident when we consider that two patients with the same Norwood-Hamilton Class 3 may have different cranial shapes and sizes. To address these differences, two simulations were conducted for the sake of comparison.

In the example of Figure 2 and Table 1, despite both patients having the same Norwood-Hamilton class 3, patient A is classified as PRECISE class 2.6 and patient B as PRECISE class 4.1. These 2 patients with the same baldness class will need completely different amounts of grafts to achieve a good result. While for patient A the recommended number of grafts would be 3900, for patient B it would be 6150 grafts.

### Patient selection, candidacy, and treatment planning for hair restoration surgery [^fb5d50dd]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Patient consultation, examination, and selection are crucial for successful outcomes in hair restoration surgery. The hair restoration surgeon must take a holistic approach in identifying those patients who are and who are not candidates for surgery. In this article, an overview of the consultation, pertinent physical examination features relating to patient candidacy, and several treatment paradigms are discussed. Additionally, those findings that may lead to poor results and conditions that are contraindications to hair restoration surgery are reviewed.

Restoration of the beard region has become an important component of hair restoration surgery due to increased awareness of its natural-appearing results. In the author's experience performing more than 700 primary beard hair transplants and tens of reparative procedures, key aesthetic steps include proper graft dissection so that one- and two-hair grafts contain a minimal cuff of surrounding skin, acute angulation and appropriate direction of recipient sites using the smallest possible recipient-site blades, and aesthetic design.

### Robotic follicular unit extraction in hair transplantation [^98d7e141]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, there has been a shift toward minimally invasive procedures. In hair transplantation surgery, this trend has manifested with the emergence of follicular unit extraction (FUE). Recently, a robot has been introduced for FUE procedures.

Objective

To determine the transection rate of a robotic FUE device.

Materials and Methods

The authors discuss the procedure, technical requirements, optimal candidates, advantages, and disadvantages of robotic FUE compared with the standard ellipse.

Results

Optimal candidates for robotic FUE are those with dark hair color who can sit for 45 to 120 minutes and are willing to shave a large area for donor harvesting. The main advantages of robotic FUE compared with the standard ellipse are its minimally invasive nature and the lack of a linear scar. The average transection rate with the robot to date is 6.6% (range, 0.4%-32.1%).

Conclusion

The robot is a new and innovative method for FUE hair transplantation of which hair transplant surgeons should be aware.

### Commentary: an arteriovenous bridge over novel, troubled water [^7f9d8a57]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors acknowledge uncertainty regarding the potential for TAH-driven super-physiologic pulsatile flow affecting fistula arterialization and wall integrity but report that the AVF did adequately mature, with sufficient size, arterialization, wall thickening, and high flow rates, despite requiring 3 interventions for atypical aneurysmal degeneration of the arterial limb of the fistula during the 15 months of use, before the patient received a heart–kidney transplant. With more experience, the procedure may be performed in a single setting, saving the patient a second operation.

Like in most cases of advances borne out of necessity, Hair and colleagues used their judgment and experience and applied sound surgical principles to a novel clinical scenario while dealing with uncertainty. Despite complications, their team managed to successfully bridge a patient to a double-organ transplant and demonstrate that, especially as medical devices and technology become ever more complex and ubiquitous, surgeons will continue to innovate.

### Strip harvesting follicular unit transplantation versus follicular unit excision: comparing the number of hairs and the ratio of hairs to follicular unit [^5cb80d33]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There are 2 extraction techniques for follicular units (FUs) in hair transplantation: strip harvesting follicular unit transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit excision (FUE). Currently, no extant studies have demonstrated that one technique is superior in extraction and donor area optimization for a dense result.

Objective

This study compares the FUT and FUE techniques by evaluating the percentage of FUs with 3 or more hairs and the hairs-to-follicular-unit ratio in patients who underwent both procedures at different times.

Materials and Methods

The medical records of patients who underwent at least 1 FUT procedure and at least 1 FUE procedure (with this being the second surgical procedure) were reviewed. The surgeries were performed in the same clinic with the same surgeon and surgical team.

Results

There was a higher percentage of FUs with 3 or more hairs and a higher hairs-to-follicular-unit ratio with the FUE technique than with the FUT technique.

Conclusion

In FUE, surgeons tend to choose better-looking FUs with thick, plentiful hairs. Even with these results, it is impossible to declare one procedure superior because the correct indication considers multiple factors.

### Hair transplantation in patients with inadequate head donor supply using nonhead hair: report of 3 cases [^4ecd2fe6]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Follicular unit extraction is becoming an increasingly popular technique for hair transplantation, as it obviates the linear scarring associated with strip harvesting, and can provide highly presentable results. Using this technique, a few reports have described the small scale use of nonhead hair for head hair transplantation in men with inadequate head hair donor supply. In this report, 3 patients who were severely bald had hair transplanted from the chest, abdomen, legs, shoulders, or beard, as well as the head to achieve full coverage and excellent hairlines. Of the 3 cases, 2 had undergone previously unsuccessful hair transplant surgeries. Approximately 80% to 85% of the transplanted grafts survived. Although hair length and quality, surgery time, and the requirement for improved surgical skills remain challenges when using this technique, the sufficiently good outcomes from these selected candidates suggest that this technique may offer the possibility of restoring even severely bald states to normality in patients who would otherwise not be candidates for traditional hair transplantation surgery.

### Hair transplantation in women: a practical new classification system and review of technique [^158ea3a5]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Alopecia in women is often overlooked as a major cosmetic problem. For women with hair loss, the psychological effects are often more severe than for men. Advances in modern hair transplantation have allowed successful hair restoration in many cases of female alopecia that might not have been possible to treat with older techniques. A classification of female hair loss patterns into 5 different categories is proposed. On the basis of these categories, a variety of techniques are demonstrated to restore alopecia. Careful preoperative patient evaluation, including analysis of the donor and recipient features, is emphasized. In addition, women's psychological reactions to hair loss and the expectations for hair restoration are discussed. (Aesthetic Surg J 2002;22:247-259.).

### A systematic review of outcomes and patient satisfaction following surgical and non-surgical treatments for hair loss [^6b8c5ac3]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This systematic review aims to examine surgical and non-surgical treatments and identify those procedures that are most effective in terms of patient satisfaction.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review protocol was developed a priori in accordance with the Preferred Reporting for Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The search was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, the Cochrane handbook. A multistep search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PreMEDLINE, Ebase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify studies on hair loss causes and hair loss treatment with different surgical and non-surgical techniques RESULTS: Our search generated a total of 781 articles; 646 studies were excluded based on the content of the abstracts, and an additional 105 studies were excluded based on the content of the complete article. We performed a review of the 30 remaining studies, which had sufficient data for inclusion, and met all the aforementioned inclusion criteria. Of the 30 studies, four were about minoxidil, four about finasteride, two about dutasteride, three about phototherapy, six about platelet-rich plasma injection, four about follicular unit transplantation technique, six about follicular unit extraction technique, and one about patient satisfaction following surgical treatment without a specified surgical technique. Only three studies used a patient-reported outcome measurement.

Conclusions

Our study is the first comprehensive systematic review of hair loss, looking at the problem from different points of view, and focusing on finding the best solution for the patient. In the literature, there is currently no algorithm for the management of patients who go to a plastic surgeon for a solution to the problem of hair loss.

### Natural asymmetry in hair growth direction: implications for hairline design in male patients [^c7fd99f8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this study highlights the natural asymmetry present in the direction of hair growth in the male hairline, particularly the predominant rightward skew. The results suggest that hair transplant surgeons should take this natural asymmetry into account when designing hairlines, as symmetrical designs may not achieve the most natural aesthetic outcome. By incorporating these findings into their practice and ensuring that patients are informed about the benefits of asymmetry, surgeons can improve both the naturalness of the results and patient satisfaction. Further research is warranted to explore the broader implications of hairline asymmetry, including its variability across different ethnicities, skull types, and sexes.

### Hair transplantation for men with advanced degrees of hair loss [^d5cd7161]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

In the field of surgical hair restoration, there is probably no greater challenge than treating the individual with advanced male pattern hair loss. Recent developments in follicular unit grafting and recognition of the natural appearance of the transplanted frontal forelock have now made it possible to obtain excellent, undetectable results in these patients. Over a 22-month period, the onset correlating with the time when the author began to use the technique of follicular unit grafting, 61 of 322 hair transplant procedures (approximately 20 percent) performed for male pattern hair loss were on men with, or at high risk of developing, advanced male pattern hair loss. Uniformly, the creation of some type of frontal forelock provided excellent results and high patient satisfaction. The concept of the frontal forelock is not new. Developments in aesthetic principles, enhanced understanding of its applicability, and the applied advantages of follicular unit grafting allow for the first time, truly undetectable results.

### Microrefined microfollicular hair transplant: a new modification in hair transplant [^37680810]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

: Hair transplant is the most common cosmetic surgery procedure in men; at our center, we perform nearly 40 transplants a month, with nearly 450 procedures in a year. Current techniques of hair transplant are well established and several authors have had remarkable results using the current techniques of microfollicular hair transplant. Orentreich described hair transplant, Shiell has reviewed current techniques in his paper, whereas Rose reviews the latest innovations in hair transplant including Neograft and robotic procedures. We present our modifications to the process based on our experience of more than 1000 cases in the last 3 years.Microrefined microfollicular hair transplant is a procedure with innovations at each step of the standard microfollicular hair transplant procedure to improve results.The steps of the procedure are as follows:

### The most influential publications regarding hair transplantation: a bibliometric review [^3ca226fd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In analyzing the level of evidence of the top 50 most-cited articles on hair transplantation, only 10% (n = 5) of the studies were found to have Level II evidence. No articles managed to provide Level I evidence. Within the articles with Level II evidence, Leavitt et al. studied the effects of finasteride (1 g) on hair transplant. Martinez et al. substantiated the impact of hair follicle-containing punch grafts on chronic ulcer healing. Shao et al. employed hair transplantation for treatment of secondary cicatricial alopecia. Ors et al. used micromotor for follicular unit extraction hair transplantation. Bernstein and Rassman compared dissecting microscope against magnifying loupes with transillumination for follicular unit graft preparation [,–]. Median level of evidence among the top 50 articles was Level IV, mainly case-series or case-control studies. There was relatively even distribution of studies between Levels III–V. Overall, the level of evidence was skewed toward weaker studies. An apparent paucity of impactful, high level of evidence research concerning surgical technique in hair transplantation persists. In our opinion, the current deficit in systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials likely stems from the challenges of conducting randomized controlled trials for reasons related to recruitment, cost, time investment, and ethics.

The US proves to be the predominant country regarding publication of high-impact articles related to hair transplantation. Compared to the runner-ups, Turkey and South Korea, which each claim five of the top 50 most-cited publications, the US has contributed 25 of the top 50 publications. This discrepancy between countries may be attributed to several causes. The US is home to some of the most prestigious international hair transplant medical associations and conferences, for example, the American Board of Hair Restoration Surgery (ABHRS), first organized in 1995. It continues as the only internationally recognized medical association granting board certification for hair restoration surgery. Another possible explanation is that non-English manuscripts may not be adequately represented by citation indexes such as Web of Science. Although we did not restrict our search by language, it is possible that works from other countries are being overlooked. Finally, the US, between 1996–2020, contributed more total publications to scientific research than any other country. It is unsurprising that this trend carries over to a specific topic such as hair transplantation.

### In vivo follicular unit multiplication: is it possible to harvest an unlimited donor supply? [^2e2655aa]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Follicular unit extraction is a process of removing one follicular unit at a time from the donor region. The most important limitation of this surgical procedure is a high transection rate.

Objective

In this clinical study, we have transplanted different parts of transected hair follicle by harvesting with the follicular unit extraction technique (FUE) in five male patients.

Materials and Methods

In each patient, three boxes of 1 cm(2) are marked at both donor and recipient sites. The proximal one-third, one-half, and two-thirds of 15 hair follicles are extracted from each defined box and transplanted in recipient boxes. The density is determined at 12 months after the procedure.

Results

A mean of 3 (range, 2-4) of the proximal one-third, 4.4 (range, 2-6) of the proximal one-half, and 6.2 (range, 5-8) of the proximal two-thirds of the transplanted follicles were observed as fully grown after 1 year. At the donor site, the regrowth rate was a mean of 12.6 (range, 10-14) of the proximal one-third, 10.2 (range, 8-13) of the proximal one-half, and 8 (range, 7-12) of the proximal two-thirds, respectively.

Conclusion

The survival rate of the transected hair follicles is directly related to the level of transection. Even the transected parts, however, can survive at the recipient site; the growth rate is not satisfactory and they are thinner than the original follicles. We therefore recommend that the surgeon not transplant the sectioned parts and be careful with the patients whose transection rate is high during FUE procedures.

### Hair transplantation techniques for the transgender patient [^f5d120cc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hair transplantation can play a complementary role in the spectrum of gender transformation procedures sought by transgender patients undergoing gender transformation surgery. The authors' clinic has seen an increase in the demand for hair restoration in transgender patients. Hairline lowering, eyebrow transplantation, and pubic hair transplantation can play roles for male-to-female transgender patients whereas beard hair transplantation and body hair transplantation can play integral roles for female-to-male patients seeking gender transformation surgery. This article delineates an experience in the role hair restoration plays for transgender patients and outlines a surgical approach for these hair restoration procedures.

### The progressive loss risk scale for hair restoration surgery [^13f8cfe2]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited information exists on the long-term risks to individuals undergoing procedures in hair restoration surgery. The short-term risks are well known and similar to other procedures in dermatologic surgery. The long-term risks of hair restoration surgery are seldom discussed between the physician and patient.

Objective

The author sought to describe a classification system that can be used as a communication tool between physicians and patients to define the long-term risk involved with hair restoration surgery.

Methods

The Progressive Loss (PL) Scale is an attempt at assessing the cosmesis because of future hair loss following a hair transplant procedure. The PL Risk Scale has designated 5 levels, 1 to 5, with each ascending level representing a higher level of risk. The PL Risk Scale can be assigned to an individual at the time of the assessment for hair restoration surgery.

Results

Each patient can be assigned a risk level based on how future hair loss may affect the overall cosmetic result of their hair transplant. This risk is dependent on age, and specific for the area to be transplanted. The younger the age of the patient, the higher the risk. The larger the area to be transplanted, the higher the risk. It is not a static scale, because it will be affected by age, donor area, location of transplantation, and other mitigating factors.

Conclusion

Pattern baldness in men and women is progressive and unrelenting. The dichotomy of hair restoration surgery is that a satisfactory short-term outcome can evolve to disappointing results because of progressive hair loss. The PL Risk Scale can be assigned to every individual undergoing a hair restoration procedure. This scale assignment will convey to the patient their lifetime risk associated with any given surgical hair restoration procedure for that age and the specific area to be restored.

### Hair restoration [^ed49fcea]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The impact of male hair loss as a personal and social marker of aging is tremendous and its persistence as a human concern throughout recorded history places it in the forefront of male concern about the physical signs of aging. Restoration of the frontal hairline has the visual effect of re-establishing facial symmetry and turning back time. Follicular unit transplantation has revolutionized hair restoration, with its focus on redistributing large numbers of genetically stable hair to balding scalp in a natural distribution. Follicular unit hair restoration surgery is a powerful tool for the facial plastic surgeon in male aesthetic facial rejuvenation because it offers high-impact, natural-appearing results with minimal downtime and risk for adverse outcome.

Graft Placement With a Sharp Implanter

Grafts are implanted by a 4- or 5-person team composed of 2 to 3 loaders, 1 passer, and the operator (Fig. 9).

FIGURE 9 
The 2(3)-1-1 system. The passer withdraws the used implanter from the operator's hand, immediately replacing it with another loaded implanter in a very precise manner, allowing the operator to work with quick, small vertical movements within a range of 5 cm. Graft insertion thereby takes place swiftly and accurately, without soft tissue damage.

In comparison with FUT grafts, FUE grafts are more slender toward the bottom (Fig. 10). Follicular unit extraction grafts are therefore more prone to physical trauma, such as desiccation. Thus, we prefer an implanter technique that enables the most atraumatic and swift graft insertion. This technique embodies much higher responsibility for the surgeon, as he/she directly implants all grafts himself/herself. It allows real-time monitoring of the surgery result. On the other hand, the high cost of sharp implanters and the intensive labor for the physician can be considered downsides of this technique.

FIGURE 10 
Follicular unit extraction grafts differ from FUT grafts in shape. A, An FUE graft. B, Two FUT grafts.

We can perform 700 to 900 punches per hour using the above techniques. Nonshaven FUE can be used for transplanting 2500 grafts in a day on average, with a maximum of 3000 grafts a day. When we began using this method, it took 1 hour to complete punch insertion for 200 to 300 grafts, which was followed by an additional hour to extract the punched grafts. Nonshaven FUE is time consuming, demands high concentration, and is physically exhausting. It also requires substantial time to acquire the necessary skills. Performing surgery on a female patient with long hair is even more difficult. Therefore, less experienced practitioners should attempt only a small number of grafts at once. To reach a high standard (Figs. 11, 12), not only the operator but also the staff should be involved with ongoing education and quality control.

### Survival rate according to grafted density of Korean one-hair follicular units with a hair transplant implanter: experience with four patients [^b3729747]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The survival rate of grafted hairs in hair transplantation has been frequently discussed by many hair-transplant surgeons. Several factors, including skill of doctors and assistants and the amount of perifollicular connective tissue, are suggested to have predictive values in foretelling the eventual quantity of hair growth.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine survival rate according to density of Korean one-hair follicular units grafted with a KNU implanter.

Methods

We designed four templates of 1 cm2 made by tattooing two templates on each side of empty frontoparietal recesses in four Korean patients with male pattern alopecia (beyond Norwood-Hamilton-Type IIIa). One-hair follicular units were prepared from occiput and we grafted 20, 30, 40, and 50 one-hair follicular units using a KNU implanter on each template, respectively, and counted the number of surviving hairs after 10 months.

Results

The survival rate of 20 and 30 grafts per template was higher than that of 40 and 50 grafts.

Conclusion

We think that 30 one-hair follicular units grafted with a KNU implanter is the proper density for better survival in Korean hair transplantation, and repeated sessions will be necessary for a better final result. However, we need further evaluation with a larger number of participants to overcome the small sample size and limitation of one-hair follicular unit grafts. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Body hair transplant by follicular unit extraction: my experience with 122 patients [^5de28005]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Survey Results

Seventy-nine patients responded to the survey, a response rate of 64.8%. Individual question response rates varied, but for overall satisfaction questions, the mean response rate was 62.6%. Mean follow-up time between last surgery and administration of the survey was 2.9 years (SD, 1.17; range, 0.2-6.3 years).

Patients were generally very satisfied with the results of their procedure, giving average scores of at least a 7.8 on a Likert-like scale of 0 to 10 for their healing status, hair growth in the recipient areas, and overall satisfaction with their surgeries. Patients who assessed the healing of their donor areas (n = 74, 60.2%) gave a mean score of 8.6 (SD, 1.63) (Table 2). Patients who, in addition to their BHT donor sources, also had head and NPA hair as a donor source reported the most satisfaction with the healing status (n = 46), giving a mean score of 8.9 (SD, 1.56). For patients who had contributions from beard hair as a donor source, rating of donor area healing made little difference whether they also had a strip scar surgery or not (mean, 8.7 vs 8.6, respectively).

Table 2. 
BHT Patient Assessment of Donor Area Healing, Based on a Scale of 0-10

Seventy-nine patients (64%) assessed the transplanted hair growth in the recipient areas, providing a mean score of 8.2 (SD, 1.71) (Table 3). Of the 65 patients in whom beard hair was used to improve the appearance of their strip scar from previous hair restoration procedures, 48 (73.8%) responded to the question of overall hair growth rate. The mean growth score provided was 8.2 (SD, 1.64). Almost all strip scar patients had beard hair used as their sole donor source (n = 60), which is characteristic of my practice. These patients provided a slightly higher mean score of 8.3 (SD, 1.64) for just their strip scar growth outcomes. Patients who had the beard as a donor source but did not have a strip scar surgery rated their overall hair growth rate as 8.3 (SD, 1.65).

### Evaluation indicators of aesthetic effects on hair transplantation [^fc267053]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Hair transplantation involves the transplantation of hair, beard, eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair. Based on our experience, the aesthetic result of hair transplantation mainly relies on 4 indicators, including selection of the donor site, direction and angle of grafted hairs, density, and survival rate of implanted hair follicles. We believe that good results can be achieved as long as attention is paid to the above 4 points.

### Use of body hair and beard hair in hair restoration [^f9bad238]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

For many hair restoration patients with limited scalp donor hair it is possible to use nonhead hair sources to increase the potential follicle supply. Follicular unit extraction provides the hair restoration surgeon with a useful surgical means for accessing this valuable source of donor reserve. Nonhead hair can also be used to restore eyebrows, eyelashes, and moustaches. This article focuses on the use of body hair and beard in hair restoration. Discussed are the indications and effective techniques for performing hair transplants using non head hair donor sources, along with the pitfalls and risks of this surgical modality.

### New donor excision design for better hair alignment in hair restoration surgery [^e5fa1402]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The linear scar and misalignment of hair follicles are disadvantages of the follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or strip technique. The most common misalignment is at the end of the strip. Although most surgeons try to match hair direction to achieve optimal hair alignment, their attempts are often unsuccessful.

Objectives

We aimed to assess strip designs to improve hair alignment during hair transplantation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 157 patients who underwent hair transplantation with either the commonly used elliptical incision or our novel triangular flag-shaped designed incision on the donor strip tip. Two blind evaluators assessed the outcome of hair alignment using a 5-point visual analog scale.

Results

In total, 303 wounds on 157 patients were assessed. Overall, our triangular flag-shaped design (TFD) achieved better hair alignment than the common elliptical design (CED) (p=0.01). Patients with hair direction straight on the upper wound edge and hair direction inward on the lower wound edge showed improved outcomes with TFD, whereas patients with hair direction inward on both upper and lower wound edges showed better outcomes with CED.

Conclusions

The TFD tip of donor strips achieved proper hair alignment for most hair transplant patients.

### Body hair transplant by follicular unit extraction: my experience with 122 patients [^3b3c9f3c]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that there are up to 12,500 hairs, or approximately 6000 follicular units consisting of 2 to 3 hairs, that are pragmatically transplantable in the average standard donor area (SDA) of the head, an area considered not at risk for hair loss due to androgenic alopecia.However, individuals with severe baldness or severely depleted donor areas from previous hair restoration procedures are not good candidates for traditional hair transplantation methods with hair from the SDA. In these cases, body hair transplantation (BHT), which refers to the use of beard and body hair donor sources in the treatment of baldness, remains a viable option in hirsute patients. - In contrast, body hair restoration (BHR) describes use of head or body hair in areas of loss in nonscalp areas (such as pubic or eyebrow hair restoration or eyelashes). - Body hair from the beard, trunk, and the extremities can be transplanted by follicular unit extraction (FUE) methods and combined with head hair, if available, to cover both scalp and nonscalp areas to improve severe baldness,create more natural and softer hairlines,repair donor strip scars from previous hair restoration surgeries,and restore facial and body hair. -

Although the application of BHT to treat baldness is promising, reports in the literature have been confined to case reports. -,, The objectives of the current article are to present the author's experience in a large series of patients who have undergone BHT using FUE, define suitable candidates selected for the procedure, illustrate the use of different donor and recipient areas, and provide information on patient satisfaction with the procedure and outcomes.

### PRECISE scale: a quantitative classification for androgenetic alopecia and its application to hair transplantation [^46ca3440]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The definition of strategies like the one mentioned above is also possible to be achieved through telehealth. This is due to the fact that the surgeon is able to quantitatively classify the baldness of a patient assisted by telemedicine using photo measurement programs in the PRECISE scale. This is a major advantage of the quantitative scale and will reduce the error brought by qualitative scales in the estimated number of FUs necessary in the procedure. For illustrative purposes, a Norwood-Hamilton class 3 patient which was classified as class 2.4 in the PRECISE scale would need around 3600 FUs in his procedure, by contrast, a Norwood-Hamilton class 3 patient classified as a PRECISE class 3.5 would need around 5250 FUs for a good result. Thereby, the PRECISE scale would also represent a rationale for adequate charging for grafts transplanted.

There are great divergences between examiners assessing the same patient and classifying him on the qualitative scales, showing that those scales are not reliable for creating a surgical plan. Differently, due to its numerical nature, the PRECISE scale should be endowed with good reproducibility, i.e. two examiners should reach the same class for the same patient. On that ground, it is expected that the routine application of the scale can speed up the learning curve for beginners in the field of hair restoration surgery.

For the near future, we aim to study and validate in greater detail the variation in the classification among users of the scale, in order to better understand its performance in terms of reproducibility. It would also be important to verify how the scale correlates with the coverage value (HCV) and the hair diameter index (HDI) for a possible subdivision of the surgical strategy according to the different features of the hair of each patient and the regions that will receive the grafts. Finally, also relevant will be the analysis of the impact in the learning curve of beginners in the hair restoration field. Ultimately, through the development of artificial intelligence, the improvement of tools may minimize errors in area measurements and facilitate the calculation of the HMI, while the scale can have its performance maximized.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^1571e9f2]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming surgeries—scope and perioperative considerations: In general, most medically necessary surgeries can be thought of as involving three regions: the face, chest/breasts, and genitalia (internal and external), with additional medically necessary procedures including body contouring and voice surgery. Facial procedures include, but are not limited to chondrolaryngoplasty, rhinoplasty, contouring or augmentation of the jaw, chin, and forehead, facelift, hair removal and hair transplantation; chest/breast procedures include breast augmentation, double mastectomy with nipple grafts, periareolar mastectomy, and liposuction, and the most common gender-affirmation surgery for TGD individuals with endogenous breast development is masculinizing chest surgery (mastectomy). Internal genital surgery procedures include but are not limited to orchiectomy, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, vaginoplasty, and colpectomy/vaginectomy, while external genital surgery procedures are not limited to vulvoplasty, metoidioplasty, and phalloplasty; hair removal is generally necessary before performing external genital procedures. Urethral lengthening is an option for both metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, but is associated with a greatly increased complication rate. Wound care and physical therapy are necessary for managing wounds from donor sites for phalloplasty, pelvic physical therapy can be an important adjunct intervention after surgery for managing voiding and sexual function, and dialogue, mutual understanding, and clear communication in a common language between patients, health care professionals (HCPs), and surgeons will contribute to well-considered decisions about the available surgical procedures.

### Body hair transplant by follicular unit extraction: my experience with 122 patients [^3d3a61eb]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Healing of donor areas can leave white dots, which are hypopigmented, tiny but flat, and insignificant scars that are hardly visible in Caucasian patients but may be more visible in patients with darker skin. The author has not observed any instance of hypertrophic scarring or keloids in part because patients with history of abnormal scarring are disqualified from having surgery and also because of good surgical practice, technique, and tooling, such as use of the UPunch Rotor, which enhances wound closure and aesthetics. However, the most common side effects of FUE in general still apply, including the occasional ingrown hair.

Because transplanted body hair (with the exception of beard hair) does not grow as long as head hair, hair is routinely maintained short after the procedure for the best cosmetic results. Another factor favoring a shorter haircut stems from the observation that in predominantly beard graft-involved BHT, a longer hair cut could present grooming challenges as beard hair is relatively wirier and may be difficult to style. In addition to maintaining hair short to optimize cosmetic results of BHT by FUE, hair dyes can be used to produce a more even coloring at the recipient site.In general, men naturally tend to be better candidates than women for BHT to the head because they typically possess beard and body hair. Finally, patient expectations must be managed accordingly, with the realization that their recipient area hair will be short, but still cosmetically acceptable, when body hairs have been transplanted.

While patient satisfaction of BHT was good in the present patients, and about two-thirds of patients answered questions, retrospective surveys have inherent limitations. Not all patients returned their surveys, which can result in response bias, as well as over- or underestimation of means and variance estimates. Second, when patients are asked to rate items that happened in the past (eg, donor healing areas), responses can be inaccurate. In addition, questionnaires were not returned anonymously, which can also be a source of bias. Despite these limitations, most patients returned their survey and reported good results. Third, a blinded, third-party assessment of patients' results based on preoperative and postoperative photos was not possible, which limits confirmation of patient assessment. Last, complete graft information was not available for every patient, which could lead to more uncertainty regarding the statistics. Strengths of the study include a relatively large sample size and breadth of combinations of donor sources.
