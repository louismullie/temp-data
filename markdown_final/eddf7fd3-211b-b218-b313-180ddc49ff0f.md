## Question

What are the guidelines for newborn hepatitis b exposure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the guidelines for newborn hepatitis B exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the exposure scenarios and the baseline risk of transmission. Then, I should verify the universal screening and maternal management steps that shape neonatal risk. Next, I will examine immediate neonatal prophylaxis, including timing, dosing, and special populations like preterm infants. After that, I need to check the vaccine series completion and post-vaccination serologic testing strategy. Finally, I will consider special circumstances, breastfeeding, documentation, and quality metrics, and close with a concise synthesis of the core recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the exposure categories and baseline risk, because this frames urgency and prophylaxis choices. Exposure scenarios include infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status, and infants born to mothers with high HBV DNA or HBeAg positivity, where the risk of perinatal transmission without prophylaxis ranges from roughly 40–90% in HBeAg-positive mothers to 5–20% in HBeAg-negative mothers, and chronicity after perinatal infection is about 90%, which underscores the need for timely intervention [^19efd959] [^d41aef41].

> Wait, let me verify the maternal screening and management steps that reduce neonatal risk. Universal screening for HBsAg should occur at the first prenatal visit in each pregnancy, with repeat testing in late pregnancy for those at high risk, and HBsAg-positive pregnant patients should have HBV DNA quantification to guide antiviral therapy decisions. If HBV DNA is ≥ 200,000 IU/mL or HBeAg is positive, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate starting at 28–32 weeks is recommended to reduce perinatal transmission, and this maternal therapy complements, but does not replace, neonatal prophylaxis [^3cf6eb1f] [^b2ba7b60] [^68fc29de].

> I need to ensure the immediate neonatal prophylaxis is precise. For infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, or when maternal status is unknown, both hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the first dose of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be administered within 12 hours of birth, ideally as soon as possible, at separate injection sites. This combined active–passive strategy reduces transmission risk from 40–90% to less than 10% and is the cornerstone of prevention [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d] [^b33545d6].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach when maternal status is unknown at delivery. For infants ≥ 2,000 g, give the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours and add HBIG as soon as possible if the mother is found to be HBsAg-positive, but no later than 7 days. For infants < 2,000 g, give both HBIG and vaccine within 12 hours regardless of maternal status because of reduced immunogenicity, and do not count the birth dose toward the series, requiring a total of four doses [^69975609] [^1844aea2].

> Let me think about the vaccine series completion and timing, because this affects durability of protection. The standard schedule is a second dose at 1–2 months and a third dose at 6 months, with the final dose not given before 24 weeks of age. For infants < 2,000 g, the birth dose is not counted, so three additional doses are given starting at 1 month, typically at 1 month, 2–3 months, and 6 months, again ensuring the final dose is not before 24 weeks [^85ffda4d] [^6c180245].

> I should double-check post-vaccination serologic testing, since this determines whether the infant is protected or infected. Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs should be performed at 9–12 months of age, not earlier, to avoid detecting passive anti-HBs from HBIG. Anti-HBc is not recommended because maternal anti-HBc can persist up to 24 months. If anti-HBs is ≥ 10 mIU/mL and HBsAg is negative, the infant is protected. If anti-HBs is < 10 mIU/mL, give a single vaccine booster and retest in 1–2 months, and if still < 10 mIU/mL, complete a second 3-dose series and retest again [^85ffda4d] [^91f70da0].

> But wait, what about special circumstances that can increase risk or alter management. High maternal HBV DNA levels, especially > 200,000 IU/mL, increase prophylaxis failure risk and justify maternal tenofovir in the third trimester. Intrapartum care should not be altered solely for HBV, and cesarean delivery is not recommended to reduce transmission. Breastfeeding is safe when the infant receives standard prophylaxis, and invasive procedures like amniocentesis may increase risk if maternal viral load is high, warranting counseling and shared decision-making [^b2ba7b60] [^3363915b] [^e456eda2] [^a075c4a9].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are addressed, because system failures drive missed prophylaxis. Maternal HBsAg results should be communicated to the delivery hospital and the infant's provider, and infants transferred between facilities should have their prophylaxis status clearly communicated. Case management through perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs improves timeliness and completeness of prophylaxis and follow-up, and should be activated for HBsAg-positive mothers [^b2e0fefc] [^85ffda4d].

> Let me reconsider the core recommendations to ensure internal consistency. All infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, or mothers with unknown status, should receive HBIG and monovalent hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Preterm infants < 2,000 g should receive both within 12 hours and require a total of four doses. The series should be completed on schedule with the final dose at ≥ 24 weeks, and post-vaccination serology at 9–12 months guides whether additional vaccination is needed. Maternal HBV DNA ≥ 200,000 IU/mL should trigger third-trimester tenofovir to further reduce transmission risk [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d] [^b2ba7b60].

> Finally, I should confirm the quality and strength of evidence supporting these practices. The USPSTF gives universal prenatal HBV screening an A rating, ACOG issues strong recommendations with moderate-quality evidence for neonatal prophylaxis within 12 hours, and ACIP provides detailed implementation guidance. Observational and programmatic data show high effectiveness of timely prophylaxis and post-vaccination testing, with protection rates around 85–95% when HBIG plus vaccine are given promptly, reinforcing the need for strict adherence to timing and follow-up [^3cf6eb1f] [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d] [^19efd959].

Newborn hepatitis B exposure management centers on **universal screening of pregnant patients** for HBsAg [^3cf6eb1f] and **timely neonatal prophylaxis**. Infants of HBsAg-positive mothers or those with unknown status should receive **HBIG and the first hepatitis B vaccine dose within 12 hours of birth** [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d], with the vaccine series completed per schedule and post-vaccination serologic testing at 9–12 months [^85ffda4d] [^9d6901c3]. If maternal HBV DNA is ≥ 200,000 IU/mL, initiate maternal tenofovir at 28–32 weeks to reduce transmission risk [^b2ba7b60] [^68fc29de]. Breastfeeding is safe with infant prophylaxis [^e456eda2] [^7621951e], and cesarean delivery is not indicated solely for HBV prevention [^3363915b] [^7621951e].

---

## Maternal screening and antepartum management

- **Universal screening**: Test all pregnant patients for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit, even if previously vaccinated or tested [^3cf6eb1f] [^b2e0fefc].

- **Repeat testing**: Test high-risk patients again at delivery if initial results are negative [^fb109456].

- **HBV DNA testing**: Quantify HBV DNA in HBsAg-positive patients to guide antiviral therapy [^b2ba7b60] [^b2e0fefc].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Initiate tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) at 28–32 weeks if HBV DNA ≥ 200,000 IU/mL or HBeAg is positive [^b2ba7b60] [^68fc29de].

---

## Neonatal prophylaxis

- **Immediate prophylaxis**: Give HBIG (0.5 mL) and the first hepatitis B vaccine dose within 12 hours of birth for infants of HBsAg-positive mothers or those with unknown status [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d].

- **Vaccine series**: Complete the 3-dose series at 1–2 months and 6 months; for infants < 2,000 g, give 4 doses (birth dose not counted) [^85ffda4d] [^6c180245].

- **Post-vaccination testing**: Check HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9–12 months to confirm protection or detect infection [^85ffda4d] [^9d6901c3].

---

## Special considerations

Breastfeeding is **safe** when the infant receives prophylaxis [^e456eda2] [^7621951e]. Cesarean delivery is **not recommended** solely to reduce HBV transmission [^3363915b] [^7621951e]. For infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, **post-vaccination serologic testing** is essential to ensure immunity or identify infection [^85ffda4d] [^9d6901c3].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Maternal screening | Universal HBsAg testing at first prenatal visit [^3cf6eb1f] [^b2e0fefc] |
| Maternal antiviral therapy | TDF if HBV DNA ≥ 200,000 IU/mL or HBeAg positive [^b2ba7b60] [^68fc29de] |
| Neonatal prophylaxis | HBIG + hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours [^6acefb37] [^85ffda4d] |

### Management of hepatitis B and C during pregnancy: neonatal implications [^57059422]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last several decades, we have seen increased rates of infants born to persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Due to this, many obstetric and pediatric organizations have updated their guidelines about screening and management of HBV and HCV during pregnancy, as well as the management of the exposed infant. Current guidelines suggest that all pregnant individuals should be screened for both HBV and HCV during each pregnancy. Appropriate medical care of pregnant persons and the newborn can significantly reduce the risk of vertical transmission.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 6 [^6821332d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the specific types of viral hepatitis, their implications during pregnancy, the risk of perinatal transmission, and issues related to both treatment and prevention of infection.

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum women and individuals who screen positive for viral hepatitis infection. The onset of these conditions may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus screening in pregnancy; prepregnancy, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum management for patients with hepatitis B virus infection or hepatitis C virus infection; management of accidental and occupational exposure to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus in pregnant health care workers; and hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus vaccination in pregnancy. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### Management of hepatitis B during pregnancy [^98e6c62c]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic HBV infection is estimated to affect > 350 million people worldwide and represents a substantial source of morbidity and mortality related to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) remains an important source of incident cases of hepatitis B. Immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen is used to prevent MTCT; however, under-utilization of this intervention in certain regions endemic for HBV infection and failure of immunoprophylaxis in 5–10% of cases are barriers to preventing HBV transmission via this route. Data suggest that a high level of HBV viraemia in pregnant women is a substantial risk factor for immunoprophylaxis failure. Potential means of reducing viral load include antiviral therapy in the third trimester to reduce exposure of the neonate to the virus. Determining the optimal time to treat active HBV-related liver disease in women who wish to become pregnant, as well as managing antiviral therapy in patients who become pregnant, remains challenging. Owing to the vulnerable population affected by these issues, clinical trials are difficult and, thus, evidence-based recommendations are limited. Emerging data are addressing management of HBV during pregnancy that health-care providers should be made aware of. Here, we provide an overview of issues pertinent to HBV infection during pregnancy and present a management algorithm.

### Update on the management of hepatitis B and C infections in the neonatal period [^da263c0d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus have received a significant amount of attention in recent years, and both viruses share a significant amount of similarities with one another beyond just that they both primarily target the liver. In recent years, cases of both infections have been fueled by a nationwide epidemic of injection drug use. Most relevant to this audience, they are both transmitted from mother to child. The increased cases in young adults combined with mother to child transmission translate into more exposed infants that will need to be managed and followed. Screening of pregnant women for hepatitis B infection coupled with appropriate treatment and prophylaxis measures are incredibly effective to preventing transmission. Prevention of hepatitis C infection is not yet possible, but advances in antiviral therapy make interruption of transmission a future possibility.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^5cf7cf89]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection — antenatal testing and perinatal prophylaxis in pregnant women with HIV: All pregnant women with HIV should be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) during the first trimester of each pregnancy, with testing repeated in late pregnancy or at hospital admission for delivery for HBsAg-negative people at high risk, and pregnant women with HIV who do not have documentation of HepB vaccination should be vaccinated against hepatitis B (strong, moderate); HBsAg-positive pregnant women should also have an HBV DNA quantitative test and a hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) test and be referred for hepatitis B–related clinical management. Prevention for newborns relies on a birth dose (within 12 hours after birth is optimal) of the HepB vaccine for all infants, with infants of HBsAg-positive women also receiving hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth; if the mother's HBsAg status is unknown, infants should receive HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth with HBIG provided within 12 hours of birth for infants (weighing < 2,000 grams) or within 7 days (for infants ≥ 2,000 grams), and when indicated HBIG should be administered concurrently with the first HepB vaccine dose at a different anatomic site, while infants of HBsAg-negative women with other evidence of HBV infection should be managed as though born to HBsAg-positive women.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^b7f31189]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing of perinatally exposed children and siblings — recommendations state that all children born to women with acute or chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection, with antibody-based testing recommended at or after 18 months of age (I, A). Testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered in the first year of life, but the optimal timing of such testing is unknown (IIa, C), and testing with an HCV-RNA assay can be considered as early as 2 months of age (IIa, B). Repetitive HCV-RNA testing prior to 18 months of age is not recommended (III, A). Children who are anti-HCV-positive after 18 months of age should be tested with an HCV-RNA assay after age 3 to confirm chronic hepatitis C (I, B). The siblings of children with vertically acquired chronic hepatitis C should be tested for HCV infection if born from the same mother (I, C).

### Recommendations for identification and public health management of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^f369a510]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the primary way to identify persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Testing has been recommended previously for pregnant women, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, household contacts and sex partners of HBV-infected persons, persons born in countries with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 8%, persons who are the source of blood or body fluid exposures that might warrant postexposure prophylaxis (e.g., needlestick injury to a health-care worker or sexual assault), and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. This report updates and expands previous CDC guidelines for HBsAg testing and includes new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts. Routine testing for HBsAg now is recommended for additional populations with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%: persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%, men who have sex with men, and injection-drug users. Implementation of these recommendations will require expertise and resources to integrate HBsAg screening in prevention and care settings serving populations recommended for HBsAg testing. This report is intended to serve as a resource for public health officials, organizations, and health-care professionals involved in the development, delivery, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^16d2e6b6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV screening and infant management — It is recommended that HBV screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) occur for all during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing. The CDC recommends that infants perinatally exposed to HBsAg be tested for HBsAg. In the context of a positive maternal HBsAg screening, all infants, including those with perinatal HIV exposure, should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the first dose of the HBV vaccine series as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours after birth, followed by the routine HBV vaccine series, and post-vaccination serologic testing for HBV should be performed between 9 and 12 months of age; infants with detectable HBV DNA should be managed in consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric HBV management.

Counseling and prevention of hepatitis B emphasize lifestyle and maternal–infant management and health care worker precautions; heavy use of alcohol " > 20 g/d in women and > 30 g/d in men" is noted, HBsAg-positive pregnant women should inform providers so "hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine can be administered to their newborn immediately after delivery", and "HBIG and concurrent hepatitis B vaccine have been shown to be 95% efficacious in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HBV, the efficacy is lower for maternal carriers with very high serum HBV DNA levels (> 8 log10 IU/mL)". For clinicians, "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who are HBsAg-positive should not perform exposure prone procedures without prior counseling and advice from an expert review panel", and "CDC does not use serum HBV DNA levels as criteria for restriction of clinical procedures, several European countries use a threshold level varying from 200 to 20,000 IU/mL to determine if HBsAg-positive health care workers are allowed to perform exposure prone procedures".

### Accelerating the momentum to achieve global elimination of hepatitis B infection: a scoping review of hepatitis B guidelines to reduce mother to child transmission [^a5e0c1db]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

HBV vaccination can greatly reduce the MTCT rate from 90% to less than 10% depending on the HBeAg status of the women and whether neonatal HBIG is given. Timing of birth dose vaccine is equally important. Delaying the birth dose vaccine beyond 24 h increased the risk of MTCT from 5.6% when administered within 24 h after birth, to 7.0% at 24–47 h after birth, and 16.7% at 48–96 h after birth. In addition, birth dose vaccination within 12 h further reduced the risk of MTCT from 2.4% to 0.6%. Comparing to birth dose vaccination given at 2–12 h, vaccination within 2 h significantly reduced MTCT from 2.73% to 0.32%. Studies demonstrated that the MTCT rate for birth dose vaccines given within 1–2 h was approximately 1–2%, which was lower than the reported rate of 1–9% in the literature. It is sensible that prompt administration of birth dose vaccine can neutralize transient intrapartum HBV exposure, resulting in a lower MTCT rate. 58% CPGs did not emphasize the importance of "vaccination as soon as possible after birth". This may potentially delay immediate vaccination or encourage later vaccination to within 12–24 h after delivery. As such, we suggest that the birth dose vaccine should be given as soon as possible and within 2 h after delivery if facilities are available. Regarding the vaccination schedule among infants of hepatitis B infected women, the timing and frequency of vaccination would depend on the type of available vaccine (monovalent versus combination) and could vary based on the country's immunization program. Either a three-dose or four-dose vaccine is considered an acceptable approach by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO, as the efficacy to achieve protective immunity is similar.

At a glance On November 3, 2023, CDC published recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children. Learn more about the peer review process. Understanding peer review Peer review:

- Involves the review of a draft product by experts in the field who were not involved in producing the draft information.
- Assures publications meet the quality standards of the academic and scientific community. This form of deliberation involves an exchange of judgments about:

- Methods used for developing guidelines.
- Strength of inferences drawn. Purpose of recommendations The report provides United States clinicians with recommendations for testing perinatally exposed infants and children for hepatitis C. These recommendations supplement CDC's 2020 universal hepatitis C screening recommendations.

Testing exposed infants with a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid at ages 2–6 months is expected to identify more perinatally exposed children and increase opportunities for linkage to care and curative treatment.
- Quality
- Objectivity
- Utility
- Integrity
- CDC intends to publish recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children in the US. The recommendations constitute influential scientific information that will have a clear and substantial impact on public policies and private sector decisions. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and scientific evidence of:

- Effectiveness
- Economic value Experts conducted, analyzed, and assessed the literature to examine the availability and quality of the evidence regarding perinatal hepatitis C infection prevalence and testing.

They also assessed the health benefits and harms associated with NAT for hepatitis C virus RNA at ages 2–6 months compared to HCV antibody testing at or after age 18 months among perinatally exposed infants and children. Experts drafted the recommendations based on the systematic and comprehensive review of the evidence on perinatal hepatitis C testing. For critical appraisal of the recommendations, peer reviewers were asked to:

- Assess whether the authors sufficiently acknowledge limitations in the evidence used to develop the recommendations and any limitations of the recommendations themselves for the intended purpose of testing infants and children for perinatal HCV infection in the US. To learn more, see supplementary tables and peer review comments and CDC responses.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^6c180245]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Evaluating and managing infants who were exposed to HBV — All infants at risk of perinatal HBV acquisition, including HBV/HIV coinfection, should receive hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the first dose of the HBV vaccination series as soon as possible and within 12 hours of birth. For infants weighing ≥ 2 kg at birth, the second and final doses of the vaccine series should be administered at age 1 to 2 months and 6 months, respectively. For infants with birth weights < 2 kg, do not count the birth dose as part of the vaccine series, and administer three additional doses at ages 1 month, 2 to 3 months, and 6 months. This regimen is > 95% effective in preventing HBV infection in infants, and maternal ART that includes nucleoside analogues with anti-HBV activity will result in low or suppressed HBV viral loads near delivery, which should further reduce the risk of perinatal HBV transmission in people with HBV/HIV coinfection.

### Hepatitis B in pregnancy: challenges and treatment [^1180612e]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) during pregnancy presents unique management challenges. Varying aspects of care must be considered, including the effects of HBV on maternal and fetal health, effects of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, treatment of HBV during and after pregnancy, and prevention of perinatal infection. Antiretroviral therapy has not been associated with increased risk of birth defects or toxicity, but despite studies designed to elucidate the drug efficacy and safety in affected individuals and the developing fetus, recommendations are inconclusive. Clinicians and patients must make individualized decisions after carefully evaluating the risks and benefits summarized in this article.

### Viral hepatitis in pregnancy: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 6 [^b2ba7b60]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in pregnancy — pregnant patients may require therapy for their own health and, for patients with elevated viral loads (greater than 200,000 international units/mL hepatitis B virus DNA; 1 million copies/mL), antiviral therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. ACOG recommends that all pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive be tested for hepatitis B virus DNA quantitatively to guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission, and pregnant patients who are HBsAg-positive with high viral loads should receive antiviral treatment in the third trimester to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Although pregnancy is generally well-tolerated by individuals with hepatitis B virus infection without evidence of advanced liver disease, patients should be monitored closely during pregnancy and postpartum because, due to immunologic changes during pregnancy, there is a risk of hepatitis flare, particularly postpartum; because there is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B virus infection, supportive care is recommended, including during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of transmission, all neonates born to women who are HBsAg-positive should receive postexposure prophylaxis (ie, hepatitis B virus vaccination, hepatitis B immunoglobulin) initiated within 12 hours of birth.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^3cf6eb1f]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy identifies women whose infants are at risk of perinatal transmission. Data from a nationally representative sample showed a prevalence of maternal HBV infection of 85.8 cases per 100 000 deliveries from 1998 to 2011 (0.09% of live-born singleton deliveries in the United States). Although there are guidelines for universal infant HBV vaccination, rates of maternal HBV infection have increased annually by 5.5% since 1998. Children infected with HBV during infancy or childhood are more likely to develop chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection increases long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.

Objective

To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update to identify substantial new evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation. The USPSTF targeted its evidence review on the effectiveness and potential harms of screening and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission.

Findings

The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen accurately identifies HBV infection. Interventions are effective for preventing perinatal transmission, based on foundational evidence and observational studies of US case management programs. In addition, there is evidence that over time, perinatal transmission has decreased among women and infants enrolled in case management, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for HBV infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. (A recommendation).

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 69: hepatitis B in pregnancy: updated guidelines [^8ac73fe1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 290 million people worldwide, and almost 2 million people in the United States, are infected with hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic hepatitis B, a vaccine-preventable communicable disease. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in pregnancy is estimated to be 0.7% to 0.9% in the United States, with > 25,000 infants born annually at risk for chronic infection due to perinatal transmission. Given the burden of disease associated with chronic hepatitis B infection, recent national guidance has expanded both the indications for screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity and the indications for vaccination. The purpose of this document is to aid clinicians caring for pregnant patients in screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity status, discuss the perinatal risks of hepatitis B infection in pregnancy, determine whether treatment is indicated for maternal or perinatal indications, and recommend hepatitis B vaccination among susceptible patients. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend triple-panel testing (hepatitis B surface antigen screening, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) at the initial prenatal visit if not previously documented or known to have been performed (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend universal hepatitis B surface antigen screening alone at the initial prenatal care visit for all pregnancies where there has been a previously documented negative triple-panel test (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that individuals with unknown hepatitis B surface antigen screening status be tested on any presentation for care in pregnancy; we also recommend that those with clinical hepatitis or those with risk factors for acute hepatitis B infection be tested at the time of admission to a birthing facility when delivery is anticipated (GRADE 1B); (4) we do not recommend altering routine intrapartum care in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B; administration of neonatal immunoprophylaxis is standard of care in these situations (GRADE 1B); (5) we do not recommend cesarean delivery for the sole indication of reducing perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend that individuals with HBV infection can breastfeed as long as the infant has received immunoprophylaxis at birth (GRADE 1C); (7) we suggest individuals with hepatitis B infection who desire invasive testing may have the procedure performed after an informed discussion on risks and benefits in the context of shared decision-making and in the context of how testing will affect clinical care (GRADE 2C); (8) in individuals with hepatitis viral loads > 200,000 IU/mL (> 5.3 log 10 IU/mL), we recommend antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide at 25 mg daily or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg daily) in the third trimester (initiated at 28–32 weeks of gestation) as an adjunctive strategy to immunoprophylaxis to reduce perinatal transmission (GRADE 1B); (9) we recommend administering hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive pregnant patients or those with unknown or undocumented hepatitis B surface antigen status, regardless of whether antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy to the pregnant patient (GRADE 1B); and (10) we recommend hepatitis B vaccination in pregnancy for all individuals without serologic evidence of immunity or documented history of vaccination (GRADE 1C).

### Management of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: propositions and challenges [^d71b8236]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during perinatal period remains an important global health problem. Despite standard passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine in neonates, up to 9% of newborns still acquire HBV infection, especially these from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers. Management of HBV infection in pregnancy still need to draw careful attention because of some controversial aspects, including the failure of passive-active immunoprophylaxis in a fraction of newborns, the effect and necessity of periodical hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) injection to the mothers, the safety of antiviral prophylaxis with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs, the benefit of different delivery ways, and the safety of breastfeeding. In this review, we highlight these unsettled issues of preventive strategies in perinatal period, and we further aim to provide an optimal approach to the management of preventing MTCT of HBV infection.

Management of Infants Born to Women Who Are HBsAg-Positive

All infants born to HBsAg-positive women should receive HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth, administered at different injection sites (e.g. separate limbs). Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose (Table 3).
Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g. presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg-positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation).
The HepB vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). Although not indicated in the manufacturers' package labeling, Pediarix may be used for infants aged ≥ 6 weeks born to HBsAg-positive mothers to complete the vaccine series after receipt of a birth dose of single-antigen HepB vaccine and HBIG.
For infants weighing < 2,000 grams, the birth dose (i.e. the initial HepB vaccine dose) should not be counted as part of the vaccine series because of the potentially reduced immunogenicity of HepB vaccine in these infants; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered beginning when the infant reaches age 1 month. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
Postvaccination serologic testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completion of the vaccine series at age 9–12 months (generally at the next well-child visit following completion of the HepB vaccine series). Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of passive anti-HBs from HBIG administered at birth and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers up to age 24 months. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation). Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. HBsAg-positive infants should be referred for appropriate follow-up.
Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and receive postexposure prophylaxis may be breastfed beginning immediately after birth.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. hospital with higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^40ed0c45]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — prenatal screening and delivery management: All pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested, and women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, counseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg negative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated, and women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g., having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, having had recent or current injecting drug use, or having an HBsAg-positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive HBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg testing should be performed before vaccine administration, and all laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When tested at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be used, and initially reactive results should promptly expedite administration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates; HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure case management and timely and age-appropriate prophylaxis for infants. Information on the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health care provider who will care for the newborn, and household and sexual contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.

### Postvaccination serologic testing results for infants aged ≤ 24 months exposed to hepatitis B virus at birth: United States, 2008–2011 [^19efd959]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

An estimated 25,000 infants are born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women annually in the United States. With no intervention, 40%-90% of these infants will acquire hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Approximately 90% of infected infants develop chronic HBV infection, with a 15%-25% risk for premature death from cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. To prevent perinatal HBV transmission, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth, and complete the 3-dose HepB series. To determine infant outcomes after postexposure prophylaxis, ACIP recommends postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) at age 9–18 months. To evaluate the implementation of these recommendations, CDC assessed outcomes at age 24 months (through 2011) among infants born to HBsAg-positive women enrolled during 2008–2009 in Enhanced Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Management Projects (EPHBP). Of 4,214 EPHBP-managed infants who completed ≥ 3 HepB doses, 63.7% had reported PVST results, 13.3% had reported PVST results but infant age was unknown, and 23.0% had no reported PVST results. Of 2,683 infants with PVST results by age 24 months, 93.3% were protected, 1.2% were infected, 3.2% remained susceptible, and 2.3% had indeterminate results. ACIP-recommended postexposure prophylaxis was highly effective among infants who completed vaccination and received PVST. PVST is critical for guiding medical management of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, identifying infants with HBV infection and in need of further care, and monitoring progress toward the elimination of perinatal HBV transmission.

Identification and Management of HBV-Infected Pregnant Women

All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (e.g. first trimester) in each pregnancy, even if they have been vaccinated or tested previously. Testing those pregnant women known to be chronically infected with HBV provides documentation of the positive HBsAg test result obtained during pregnancy and helps to ensure that their infants will be identified for timely prophylaxis. All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be tested for HBV DNA to guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal HBV transmission (new recommendation). AASLD suggests maternal antiviral therapy when the maternal HBV DNA is > 200,000 IU/mL (new recommendation). All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should be referred to their jurisdiction's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP) for case management to ensure that their infants receive timely prophylaxis and follow-up. A copy of the original laboratory report indicating the pregnant woman's HBsAg-positive status should be provided to the hospital or birthing facility where the delivery is planned and to the HCP who will care for the newborn infant. All HBsAg-positive pregnant women should receive information concerning HBV that discusses the potential use of antiviral therapy, the importance of prophylaxis for their infant (HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth), completion of the vaccine series, and postvaccination serologic testing.
Women not tested prenatally, those with clinical hepatitis, and those whose behaviors place them at high risk for HBV infection (e.g. recent or current injection-drug use, having had more than one sex partner in the previous 6 months or an HBsAg-positive sex partner, having been evaluated or treated for a STI) should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital or birthing facility for delivery.
All laboratories that provide HBsAg testing of pregnant women should use a Food and Drug Administration–licensed or approved HBsAg test and should perform testing according to the manufacturer's labeling, including testing of initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols may be used and initially reactive results reported to expedite administration of postexposure prophylaxis of infants. Commercial laboratories should be encouraged to capture pregnancy status for women tested for HBsAg to aid in identification of HBV-infected pregnant women.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant women: evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^738a00a4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women to identify newborns who will require prophylaxis against perinatal infection is a well-established, evidence-based standard of current medical practice. In 2004, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended universal screening of pregnant women for HBV infection at the first prenatal visit.

Purpose

To search for large, high-quality studies related to hepatitis B screening in pregnancy that have been published since the 2004 USPSTF recommendation.

Data Sources

English-language studies indexed in PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and published between 1 January 2001 and 5 March 2008.

Study Selection

For benefits of screening and newborn prophylaxis, we included systematic reviews; meta-analyses; and randomized, controlled trials. For harms of screening, we included systematic reviews; meta-analyses; randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; and case series of large, multisite databases. Abstracts and full articles were independently reviewed for inclusion by both reviewers.

Data Extraction

Data on the benefits of screening, including benefits of hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine prophylaxis of newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, were extracted by 1 reviewer.

Data Synthesis

No new studies met inclusion criteria. A 2006 systematic review of randomized, controlled trials found that newborn prophylaxis reduced perinatal transmission of HBV infection; all relevant trials were published in 1996 or earlier.

Limitation

The focused search strategy, which was restricted to English-language articles, may have missed some smaller studies or new research published in languages other than English.

Conclusion

No new evidence was found on the benefits or harms of screening for HBV infection in pregnant women. Previously published randomized trials support the 2004 USPSTF recommendation for screening.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^34f5c5ab]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Accumulating data related to prevention, surveillance and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) provided the impetus for this updated guideline, using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Methods

The guideline was developed in compliance with the National Academy of Medicine standards. The guideline panel developed structured questions following the Population, Intervention Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) framework. The panel addressed 6 PICO questions covering prevention (maternal to infant transmission and horizontal transmission), surveillance for liver cancer (among hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg) persons co-infected with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus and/or human immunodeficiency viruses and after HBsAg loss) and treatment (HBsAg positive persons in immune-tolerant or indeterminate phases as well as withdrawal of antiviral therapy), providing evidence-based recommendations on these topics. Four systematic reviews of the literature were conducted, and two existing systematic reviews were utilized to support the recommendations in this practice guideline.

Conclusions

This evidence-based guideline provides updated recommendations to optimize the care of persons with CHB.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^938c873f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted via blood or sexual contact. Persons with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer and require medical care. This report updates and summarizes previously published recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC regarding the prevention of HBV infection in the United States. ACIP recommends testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA); administration of HepB vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for infants born to HBV-infected women within 12 hours of birth, followed by completion of the vaccine series and postvaccination serologic testing; universal hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth, followed by completion of the vaccine series; and vaccination of children and adolescents aged < 19 years who have not been vaccinated previously. ACIP recommends vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection, including universal vaccination of adults in settings in which a high proportion have risk factors for HBV infection and vaccination of adults requesting protection from HBV without acknowledgment of a specific risk factor. These recommendations also provide CDC guidance for postexposure prophylaxis following occupational and other exposures. This report also briefly summarizes previously published American Association for the Study of Liver Diseasest guidelines for maternal antiviral therapy to reduce perinatal HBV transmission

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^e4f2bcb6]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B in pregnancy — prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT): Although infant vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) are highly effective, prophylaxis failure occurs in up to 15% of pregnancies, and timeliness matters, with vaccination within 12 hours of birth recommended; risk of MTCT increases significantly when maternal HBV-DNA levels exceed 200,000 IU/mL at delivery; the preferred drug is TDF, starting at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation, with reductions in MTCT from 18% to 5%; earlier initiation of antiviral treatment should be considered for HBV-DNA levels of 7-log IU/mL or greater to achieve levels of less than 200,000 IU/mL at delivery, and treatment can be stopped after delivery, with no clear benefit on ALT flares if the antiviral is stopped at delivery versus 1 to 3 months postpartum.

### Perinatal hepatitis C testing recommendations… [^1224b9de]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance CDC released recommendations that prioritize hepatitis C virus testing of all perinatally exposed infants at age 2 to 6 months with a nucleic acid test for detection of HCV. Dear Colleague November 1, 2023 Today CDC released CDC Recommendations for Hepatitis C Testing Among Perinatally Exposed Infants and Children — United States, 2023. The recommendations prioritize hepatitis C virus testing of all perinatally exposed infants at age 2 to 6 months with a nucleic acid test for detection of HCV. This new recommendation for HCV RNA testing among perinatally exposed infants at age 2 to 6 months promotes early diagnosis and linkage to care for this vulnerable group. These recommendations will help to increase identification and treatment of children with perinatally acquired HCV infection, improve health outcomes, and result in cost-savings to the healthcare system.

These recommendations leverage the high attendance at well-child visits in the first 6 months of life to conduct early HCV testing. Reaching infants at age 2 to 6 months increases the likelihood that testing is completed and that children with perinatally acquired HCV infection are linked to evaluation and treatment. We encourage that all providers become familiar with and implement universal hepatitis C screening recommendations among pregnant persons, all infants exposed to hepatitis C during pregnancy or delivery are tested using a NAT for HCV RNA at age 2 to 6 months of life, and any child with detectable HCV RNA is linked to evaluation and treatment. As mentioned today in a commentary in. Pediatrics, we can leverage the existing infrastructure that supports the successes of the near elimination of perinatal HIV and hepatitis B transmission to also reduce HCV infection among pregnant persons and their infants.

Modest investments of public health resources will ensure that all populations, including infants with perinatally acquired infection, are included in national elimination efforts. These recommendations are one part of CDC's commitment to supporting the prevention of HCV infections among families with young children, and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to be cured. To make elimination a reality, CDC will continue to work to address the factors that lead to perinatal transmission to help ensure maternal and child health is protected and every person with hepatitis C knows their status and has access to life-saving treatment.

INTRODUCTION

In the U.S. there are an estimated 860,000–2.4 million people living with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who are at risk of premature death from liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma if they are not monitored for disease progression and receive antiviral therapy when indicated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 20,678 women who gave birth in 2015 were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Pregnant women infected with HBV can transmit the infection to their newborns. Without immunoprophylaxis, as many as 90% of infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)– and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive mothers (who are generally highly viremic) and 5%–20% of infants born to HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative mothers will develop CHB. Infants who develop CHB are at the highest risk of death from liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. By CDC estimates, about 950 infants each year became chronically infected with HBV from perinatal transmission in the U.S.

Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) — birth dose and series for this schedule: Minimum age is Birth. Administer monovalent HepB to newborns before hospital discharge; normal-weight infants of mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative should receive HepB within 24 hours of birth or at discharge, whichever comes first. If mother is HBsAg-positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours after birth. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours after birth; determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if HBsAg-positive, administer HBIG as soon as possible. If the infant weighs < 2,000 grams at birth, do not wait more than 12 hours after birth to administer HBIG; if the infant weighs ≥ 2,000 grams at birth, do not wait more than 7 days to administer HBIG. The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containing HepB. The second dose should be administered at age 1 through 2 months. Monovalent HepB should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks. The final dose should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks. Infants who did not receive a HepB birth dose should receive three doses of a HepB- containing vaccine on an age-appropriate schedule. It is permissible to administer four doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose; if monovalent HepB is used for doses after the birth dose, a dose at age 4 months is not needed.

Hepatitis B Vaccine (HepB) in infants, children, and adolescents with HIV — the minimum age is birth. Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers who have completed at least three doses of a licensed HepB series should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs at ages 9 months through 12 months, and infants who are less than 2,000 grams at birth and receive a birth dose should receive four doses of HepB vaccine. For children and adolescents with HIV, testing for anti-HBs is also recommended and should be performed 1 to 2 months after administration of the last dose using a method that allows determination of a protective level of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Children and adolescents with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary schedule should receive a second series, followed by anti-HBs testing 1 to 2 months after the third dose. The need for booster doses has not been determined; annual anti-HBs testing and booster doses when anti-HBs levels decline to < 10 mIU/mL should be considered in individuals with ongoing risk for exposure.

### A pregnant patient with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [^52b0bd7b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. The highest rates of chronic infection occur in subjects who are infected early in life and these patients are also at the greatest risk of developing complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis from the disease. There has been a concerted worldwide effort to immunise newborns that are at the highest risk of acquiring infection. In 1992, when WHO recommended global vaccination against hepatitis B, only 31 countries elected to participate in the programme. By 2009, 177 countries were part of WHO national infant immunisation programme. Consequently, maternal screening and infant immunoprophylaxis have significantly reduced vertical transmission of hepatitis B. In this paper, we will review the management of hepatitis B in the pregnant population and identify some of the challenges that are encountered in this specialised population.

Hepatitis B exposure management — source HBsAg positive — Unvaccinated persons or persons known not to have responded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should receive both HBIG and hepatitis vaccine as soon as possible (preferably ≤ 24 hours) after a discrete, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood from a person with HBsAg. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomic site, and the vaccine series should be completed by using the age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule. Exposed persons who are not fully vaccinated because they did not complete the vaccine series should receive HBIG [i.e., 0.06 mL/kg body weight] and complete the vaccine series. Persons who have written documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series who did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose, and exposed persons who are known to have responded to a complete hepatitis B vaccination series are considered protected and need no additional doses of vaccine or HBIG.

### Safeguarding mothers and newborns: the urgent need to address hepatitis During pregnancy [^a8adda59]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal and timely management of pregnant women and infants is vital to global efforts aimed at eliminating viral hepatitis. As no vaccine is available to protect against HCV, the focus is on identifying infected women, minimizing obstetrical contributions to perinatal transmission risks, and closely monitoring infants. Region-specific strategies, supported by national elimination plans and sufficient resources, are necessary to address the epidemiology and disease burden effectively. For instance, the TiP-HepC Registry project, led by the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination and supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aims to consolidate existing data and engage stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the treatment of HCV during pregnancy. Another example is the WHO's Triple Elimination Initiative, which urges countries to commit to eliminating the transmission of HIV, syphilis, and HBV from mother to child, promoting integrated service delivery.

Certainly, managing viral hepatitis during pregnancy requires special consideration. However, raising awareness among potentially infected individuals and sharing the ABCs of Viral Hepatitis is probably even more critical due to the risk of vertical transmission. Often, women are unaware of their infection and can pass it to their infants during childbirth, causing long-term liver damage, liver cancer, and cirrhosis: According to the latest WHO report, only 9% of those living with HBV infection knew their status. Therefore, the CDC recommends that all adults undergo testing for hepatitis B and C at least once in their lifetime, with pregnant women requiring testing during each pregnancy, as it is the only reliable method to determine hepatitis status.

Hepatitis in pregnancy revolves around the risk of vertical transmission, but interventions exist to prevent or reduce negative outcomes. The WHO's 2016 strategy on viral hepatitis set an ambitious goal to eliminate it as a public health issue by 2030, targeting a 90% reduction in incidence and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015. While England has already succeeded in meeting the new WHO targets for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, achieving over 90% infant HBV vaccination coverage, hepatitis C among pregnant women has risen tenfold over the past 20 years in the USA, emphasizing the importance of universal screening for HCV infection in pregnancy. The urgency of addressing viral hepatitis during pregnancy cannot be underestimated: It cannot wait, and it is a responsibility we must all take seriously to ensure a healthier future for both mothers and their newborns.

### # 38: hepatitis B in pregnancy screening, treatment, and prevention of vertical transmission [^6808a378]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Between 800,000–1.4 million people in the United States and more than 240 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specific to pregnancy, an estimated prevalence of 0.7–0.9% for chronic hepatitis B infection among pregnant women in the United States has been reported, with > 25,000 infants at risk for chronic infection born annually to these women. Vertical transmission of HBV from infected mothers to their fetuses or newborns, either in utero or peripartum, remains a major source of perpetuating the reservoir of chronically infected individuals globally. Universal screening for hepatitis B infection during pregnancy has been recommended for many years. Identification of pregnant women with chronic HBV infection through universal screening has had a major impact in decreasing the risk of neonatal infection. The purpose of this document is to aid clinicians in counseling their patients regarding perinatal risks and management options available to pregnant women with hepatitis B infection in the absence of coinfection with HIV. We recommend the following: (1) perform routine screening during pregnancy for HBV infection with maternal HBsAg testing (grade 1A); (2) administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBV immunoglobulin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers or those with unknown or undocumented HBsAg status, regardless of whether maternal antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy (grade 1A); (3) In pregnant women with HBV infection, we suggest HBV viral load testing in the third trimester (grade 2B); (4) in pregnant women with HBV infection and viral load > 6–8 log 10 copies/mL, HBV-targeted maternal antiviral therapy should be considered for the purpose of decreasing the risk of intrauterine fetal infection (grade 2B); (5) in pregnant women with HBV infection who are candidates for maternal antiviral therapy, we suggest tenofovir as a first-line agent (grade 2B); (6) we recommend that women with HBV infection be encouraged to breast-feed as long as the infant receives immunoprophylaxis at birth (HBV vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin) (grade 1C); (7) for HBV infected women who have an indication for genetic testing, invasive testing (eg amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) may be offered-counseling should include the fact that the risk for maternal-fetal transmission may increase with HBV viral load > 7 log 10 IU/mL (grade 2C); and (8) we suggest cesarean delivery not be performed for the sole indication for reduction of vertical HBV transmission (grade 2C).

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^91f70da0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Evaluating and managing infants who were exposed to HBV — Infant post-vaccination testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completing the vaccine series, between the ages of 9 months and 18 months, and serologic testing should not be performed before age 9 months. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants aged ≤ 24 months who were born to mothers with HBV. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels > 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management, whereas HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HBV vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1 to 2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs levels remain < 10 mIU/mL following single-dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HBV vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing at 1 to 2 months after the final dose.

### Management of chronic hepatitis B in pregnancy [^539d485b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to mother-to-child transmission during the perinatal period remains an important global health problem. Despite standard passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine in neonates, up to 8.5% of newborns still acquire HBV infection. Thus, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission are important steps in eradicating or reducing the global burden of chronic HBV infection. To date, the management of HBV infection in pregnancy still needs careful attention because of some controversial aspects, including the influence of pregnancy on the course of HBV replication, safety of antiviral prophylaxis with nucleus(t)ide analogs, postpartum flares of hepatitis after delivery, and the safety of breastfeeding. In this review, we highlight these important issues of preventive strategies in the perinatal period.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^2444ae70]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in children with or exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — definition, transmission, and perinatal prevention: Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for > 6 months, and chronicity after acute infection develops in about 90% of infants, 25% to 50% of children aged 1 to 5 years, and 6% to 10% of older children and adolescents. Infants and children most commonly acquire HBV perinatally or through postnatal household contact, with horizontal transmission occurring via non-intact skin or mucous membranes contacting blood or body fluids or by sharing personal-care objects; the risk from blood transfusions with blood bank screening is very low at 1.37 per million donations. Maternal HBV infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, and it is not known if maternal HIV coinfection modifies the risk of HBV perinatal transmission. Among perinatally exposed infants, a three-dose HepB vaccine regimen is 70% to 95% effective, increasing to 85% to 95% when combined with hepatitis B immune globulin, and an anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL is considered protective; risk of perinatal transmission increases when the pregnant woman has a high circulating level of HBV DNA.

### Uptake of combined immunoprophylaxis for newborns exposed to hepatitis B virus in a high hepatitis B endemic rural setting in Northern Ghana [^982d5d58]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Ghana has developed the National Viral Hepatitis Policy in response to the high burden of HBV. The policy among many other strategies, outlined specific guidelines for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HBV. The policy recommendations include screening all pregnant women for HBsAg, and providing antiviral therapy, such as Tenofovir, to high-risk mothers with HBsAg + status and high viral loads during the third trimester. The policy also gave guidelines on the administration of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B birth dose vaccine to HBV-exposed newborns within 24 h, followed by completion of the full vaccination series and post-vaccination testing. The implementation of the PMTCT program by the Ghana Health Service (GHS) as well as private health institutions has led to a notable increase in the proportion of pregnant women tested for HBsAg by the time of delivery, rising from 87.2% in 2017 to 94.3% in 2020.

Unfortunately, Ghana has yet to implement and integrate the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization. Additionally, the cost of HBIG and the monovalent vaccine is borne by caregivers of exposed infants, as these interventions are not covered by the country's sole national health insurance scheme. The unavailability and high cost of the HBV monovalent vaccine and HBIG have been cited as key contributors to the suboptimal utilization of PEP for newborns exposed to HBV in many parts of Ghana, resulting in the failure to achieve the World Health Organization's target of less than 1% HBsAg positivity among children under five years of age. Previous studies conducted in Ghana have primarily focused on assessing the knowledge levels of healthcare providers and identifying systemic barriers to the implementation of interventions for the PMTCT of HBV. However, little to no attention has been given to the actual coverage of immunoprophylaxis such as timely birth-dose vaccination and administration of HBIG among exposed newborns. Moreover, the factors associated with the uptake of these critical interventions remain poorly understood. This represents a significant research gap, as understanding both the extent of immunoprophylaxis coverage and its determinants is essential for informing targeted strategies to reduce perinatal HBV transmission in Ghana.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^9fd992a9]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy — infectious disease screening: Screening for infectious diseases, listed below, during pregnancy per current guidance from the CDC is recommended, with appropriate follow-up treatment, prophylaxis treatment, or both depending on the history, known exposure, and symptoms of infectious disease. Conditions listed for screening include Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Rubella, Varicella, Human papillomavirus (HPV) (if the patient has a history of an abnormal cervical screen), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Asymptomatic bacteriuria, Tuberculosis, and Group B streptococcus (GBS). Infectious diseases during pregnancy can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both the pregnant patient and the fetus, screening for infectious diseases, counseling, and treatment can improve maternal and fetal outcomes, and Group B streptococcus infections are the leading cause of serious neonatal infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia) within the first 7 days of life (early-onset infection).

### Treatment and prevention of viral hepatitis in pregnancy [^c8f6488e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Viral hepatitis in pregnancy may be caused by many types of viruses that cause systemic infection or target hepatocytes in their pathogenesis. Because viral hepatitis during pregnancy may represent acute or chronic infection or the reactivation of a prior infection, a high clinical suspicion, medical history review, and awareness of risk factors for the acquisition of infection are important management principles. The route of infection varies widely and ranges from fecal-oral transmission for the hepatitis A and E viruses to vertical transmission for hepatitis B, blood-borne transmission for hepatitis C, and sexual transmission for the herpes simplex virus. For this reason, the exposure details about travel, food preferences, drug use, and sexual contacts are important to elicit. Although routine prenatal screening is recommended for chronic viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis B and C, most other causes of viral hepatitis in pregnancy are detected in the setting of compatible signs and symptoms (fatigue, abdominal discomfort, jaundice, scleral icterus) or incidentally noted transaminitis on routine labs. Serologic testing is helpful for diagnosis with molecular testing as indicated to guide the management of hepatitis B and C. Preventive vaccines for hepatitis A and B with established safety of use in pregnancy are recommended for women who are at risk of acquisition. Postexposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A is a single dose of immunoglobulin and vaccination can be used if immunoglobulin G is not available. Antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is recommended as prophylaxis in pregnant women with active hepatitis B and an elevated viral load (> 200,000 IU/mL) during the third trimester to prevent vertical transmission. The neonate exposed to hepatitis B at birth should receive immunoglobulin G and a monovalent birth dose vaccine within 12 hours, followed by completion of the 3-dosage vaccine series. The prevalence of hepatitis C in women of reproductive age has increased in the United States, and the role of antiviral therapy during pregnancy is of great interest. Cesarean delivery is not currently recommended for the sole purpose of reducing vertical transmission risk in pregnant women with viral hepatitis. Breastfeeding is recommended in women with hepatitis A, B, and C. New and promising prevention and treatment options for hepatitis B and C are under investigation. Investigators and regulatory authorities should ensure that these clinical trials for promising antivirals and vaccines are designed to include pregnant and lactating women.

### Improving integrated perinatal care for women with hepatitis B in China [^5e0ac92d]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Scientific research needed to guide evidence based care

More research into the effectiveness of the hepatitis B treatment algorithm is needed to further optimise integrated perinatal care (box 1).

Box 1
Future scientific research areas for hepatitis B in pregnancy

The safety and effectiveness of hepatitis B treatments need more validation in large cohort studies or randomised controlled trials. The optimal time to start antiviral treatment in pregnancy to prevent MTCT is also controversial. Although the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine derived from Merck's technology has been widely used in China since the 1990s, more effective hepatitis B vaccines, such as a multi-protein hepatitis B vaccine, need to be developed to improve protection for newborns exposed to hepatitis B in utero. Optimisation of combined hepatitis B vaccines and immunoglobulin also need more large cohort studies to understand the effect of earlier use of hepatitis B vaccine on preventing MTCT.

Obstetric management of women with hepatitis B needs more basic and translational research to improve outcomes in pregnancy. The Chinese Center for Disease Control has created and improved a management information system for the prevention of MTCT, which covers all districts and counties in the country. This system, along with strong basic science resources and PMTCT network support, real time monitoring, supervision evaluation, and continuous epidemiological study will continue to build a research foundation for eliminating MTCT of hepatitis B.

Research on increasing adherence to treatment and optimising care coordination needs to continue. Social and financial barriers for women with hepatitis B, their partners, and their families need further study to enhance MTCT prevention strategies.

Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HBsAg Status

Infants born to women for whom HBsAg testing results during pregnancy are not available but other evidence suggestive of maternal HBV infection exists (e.g. presence of HBV DNA, HBeAg-positive, or mother known to be chronically infected with HBV) should be managed as if born to an HBsAg-positive mother (new recommendation). The infant should receive both HepB vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth.
Women admitted for delivery without documentation of HBsAg test results should have blood drawn and tested as soon as possible.
While maternal HBsAg test results are pending, infants with birth weights ≥ 2,000 grams born to women with an unknown HBsAg status should receive the first dose of HepB vaccine (without HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. Only single-antigen HepB vaccine should be used for the birth dose (Table 3). If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but no later than age seven days, and the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-negative, the vaccine series should be completed according to the recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days).
Because of the potentially decreased immunogenicity of vaccine in infants weighing < 2,000 grams, these infants should receive both single-antigen HepB vaccine and HBIG, administered at different injection sites (e.g. separate limbs), if the mother's HBsAg status cannot be determined within 12 hours of birth. The birth dose of vaccine should not be counted as part of the 3 doses required to complete the vaccine series; 3 additional doses of vaccine (for a total of 4 doses) should be administered according to a recommended schedule on the basis of the mother's HBsAg test result. The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). If it is not possible to determine the mother's HBsAg status (e.g. when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth), the vaccine series should be completed according to a recommended schedule for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (new recommendation). The final dose in the series should not be administered before age 24 weeks (164 days). These infants should receive postvaccination serologic testing at age 9–12 months, and revaccination if necessary (new recommendation).
Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing should not be performed before age nine months to avoid detection of passive anti-HBs from HBIG administered at birth and to maximize the likelihood of detecting late HBV infection. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers up to age 24 months. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later (new recommendation). Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. HBsAg-positive infants should be referred for appropriate follow-up.
Infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status may be breastfed beginning immediately after birth.
For infants transferred to a different facility after birth (e.g. a hospital with a higher level of neonatal care), staff at the transferring and receiving facilities should communicate regarding the infant's HepB vaccination and HBIG receipt status to ensure prophylaxis is administered in a timely manner (new recommendation).

### Hepatitis B vaccine refusal trends in Washington, DC, newborns, 2017–2022 [^0d47beb8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis B affects about 1000 US infants through mother-to-child transmission annually, necessitating immediate birth vaccination to provide 70% to 95% protection and prevent severe disease. Historically, newborn hepatitis B vaccination rates have been lower than desired, with coverage of the birth dose below 77% among children born during 2017 and 2018. In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised the vaccination guidelines in January 2018, recommending that medically stable newborns weighing at least 2000 g and born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–negative mothers should receive their first dose within 24 hours of birth. The new guidelines were more explicit about administering the birth dose within 24 hours and removed the previously permissive language allowing for delay. The 2018 guideline changes were followed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing reduced uptake of routine childhood vaccines. It is uncertain whether the pandemic affected the rate of hospital-administered birth doses of the hepatitis B vaccination. Our study analyzed trends in hepatitis B birth dose refusals in Washington, DC, hospitals from 2017 to 2022, after the revised guidelines and during the pandemic.

### Gaps in prenatal hepatitis B screening and management of HBsAg positive pregnant persons in the U.S., 2015–2020 [^058c3a90]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study suggests that as many as half a million pregnant persons who gave birth in the U.S. each year were not tested for hepatitis B and that this could have resulted in a failure to identify as many as 1,480 HBsAg-positive pregnant persons at risk for perinatal transmission of hepatitis B each year. The study further found that less than half of the HBsAg-positive pregnant persons received HBV-directed monitoring during pregnancy. These gaps in screening and monitoring may have contributed to the estimated 950 infants who develop CHB each year in the U.S. A national strategy to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B by 2030 would need a call to action to strengthen the implementation of the existing recommendations and to introduce new healthcare providers, pregnant persons, and health systems–related strategies to improve prenatal hepatitis B screening, HBV-directed monitoring, and management of HBsAg-positive pregnant persons.

### Risks of infectious diseases in newborns exposed to alternative perinatal practices [^38b56c81]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) neonatal prophylaxis — during parental refusal, pediatricians should assess the birth parent's HBsAg status, document it, and identify potential risk factors; if HBsAg is negative and no risk factors are identified, the risk to the newborn infant of perinatal acquisition is likely low, although the precise risk has not been quantified. In infants whose maternal HBsAg status is unknown but risk factors are present, and particularly those born to HBsAg-positive individuals, pediatricians should strongly advocate for early administration of both HBIG and HepB within 12 hours of delivery. Ninety-five percent of infants born to persons identified as being infected with HBV receive the recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth, suggesting refusal is uncommon; however, in certain cases such as infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, particularly those born to HBeAg-positive mothers, which confers a much higher likelihood of perinatal transmission, if parents resist this recommendation, the provider should consider seeking state intervention through child protective services because refusal places the infant at significant risk of serious harm compared with vaccinating the infant.

### Management of hepatitis B in pregnant women and infants: a multicentre audit from four london hospitals [^9f5f6d7a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains endemic in many parts of the world and there are over 2 billion infected individuals worldwide. The risk of chronicity of hepatitis B is inversely related to the age of acquisition of infection; vertical transmission is associated with a risk of chronicity of more than 80%. Infants with chronic infection have a 25% lifelong risk of developing cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening of pregnant women for HBV and managing infected women and their infants appropriately in order to interrupt mother-to-child transmission is therefore of paramount importance.

The risk of vertical transmission of HBV is 70–90% when the woman is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, and around 40% when HBeAg is absent. Active or passive immunisation or both reduces the risk of vertical transmission by 90%. A high maternal viral load (VL) increases risk of transmission to the child, with babies born to women who are HBeAg positive and have a high VL (above 2 × 10 7 IU/ml or log 8 copies/ml) having an estimated transmission risk of at least 10% despite use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and vaccination. Use of antivirals in pregnancy is suggested as a means to reduce this risk. However safety and efficacy data on use of antivirals for transmission purposes are not robust.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^6af4db68]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^969da70e]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

HBsAg-positive pregnant women with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) — perinatal transmission prevention and breastfeeding safety — In 11 controlled studies (1,504 mother-infant pairs) of third-trimester antiviral therapy, perinatal transmission was reduced (RR, 0.32; 95% CI: 0.23–0.46), and in available studies therapy was started between weeks 28 and 32 of pregnancy. The HBV DNA threshold to consider antiviral therapy to prevent perinatal transmission is > 2 × 10⁵ IU/mL, and tenofovir is considered the preferred choice. Background data note that a combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccination within 12 hours of birth reduced perinatal transmission from > 90% to < 10% and that failures almost all occur in HBeAg-positive women with very high viral loads, generally above 2 × 10⁵–10⁷ IU/mL. Breastfeeding safety findings include that lamivudine concentration in breastfed infants was only 3.7% of the mother's level; the daily lamivudine dose via breast milk was only 2% of the recommended dose in infants greater than 3 months of age; and in a small study of 5 women, the median amount of tenofovir ingested from breast milk was only 0.03% of the recommended pediatric dose. Additional safety observations report that rates of C-section, postpartum hemorrhage or creatine kinase elevation were not increased with antiviral therapy and that whole-body bone mineral content of tenofovir-exposed infants was 12% lower than for unexposed infants. A perinatal transmission rate as high as 9% has been reported when maternal viral loads were > 10⁸ copies/mL (≥ 2 × 10⁷ IU/mL).
