## Question

What causes late periods other than pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes late periods other than pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "late period" in a clinically meaningful way. Then, I should verify the first principle of excluding pregnancy. Next, I will categorize the non-pregnant causes by pathophysiology and frequency, and I will double-check the most common etiologies. After that, I should outline a practical diagnostic approach and highlight red flags that warrant urgent evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of causes and note special populations and modifiers, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines or high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify normal variation as pathology. In reproductive-age patients with previously regular cycles, a delay of about one week warrants excluding pregnancy, whereas secondary amenorrhea is typically defined as absence of menses for more than 3 months in those with prior regular cycles, or 6 months in those with irregular cycles; in adolescents, cycles beyond 45 days or more than 3 months between periods merit evaluation, recognizing that early cycles are often anovulatory and variable [^046be0d1] [^5078e0dd] [^56c0518e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before anything else, I need to ensure pregnancy is excluded because even a single missed period in a person with regular cycles demands a pregnancy test. Urine hCG tests are highly sensitive, but timing matters; if the test is negative and suspicion remains, repeating in a week or using a quantitative serum hCG is prudent, and I should remember that recent pregnancy, abortion, or lactation can confound interpretation due to persistent hCG or altered ovulation patterns [^046be0d1] [^0833e792].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiologic framework so I don't miss a category. Non-pregnant causes of late or absent menses arise from four interconnected systems: hypothalamic–pituitary, ovarian, uterine/outflow tract, and systemic or iatrogenic factors; contemporary guidance emphasizes that most cases cluster into a handful of conditions, which I will verify against prevalence data and guideline summaries [^9cbd4fa8] [^e46fb782].

> I will now examine hypothalamic–pituitary causes, which are common and often modifiable. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea from energy deficit, excessive exercise, or psychosocial stress accounts for roughly a third of secondary amenorrhea; I should confirm that diagnosis of exclusion requires ruling out organic etiologies and that restoration of energy balance can reverse the condition, which is supported by endocrine society guidance and contemporary reviews [^9cbd4fa8] [^13cc670a]. Hyperprolactinemia, including prolactinomas, is another key pituitary cause that suppresses GnRH and presents with amenorrhea or galactorrhea; dopamine agonists are first-line therapy and restore menses in most cases, so I need to check prolactin early in the workup [^b6d01d1f]. Thyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, can disrupt menstrual cyclicity and should be screened with TSH given its frequency and treatability [^e46fb782].

> Let me consider ovarian etiologies next, and I should double-check the most prevalent. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the leading endocrine cause of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in reproductive-age patients, with prevalence around 6–12% and a pathophysiology driven by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance; I need to ensure I apply Rotterdam criteria thoughtfully and screen for metabolic comorbidities when suspected [^339ef88c]. Primary ovarian insufficiency, defined as loss of ovarian function before age 40, presents with amenorrhea and hypoestrogenism; I should confirm with elevated FSH and low estradiol and counsel on fertility and estrogen replacement, aligning with ESHRE guidance for early evaluation in amenorrheic patients under 40 [^df43d59a]. I should also remember that obesity can amplify estrogen production and alter gonadotropin dynamics, contributing to cycle irregularity, which ties metabolic health to menstrual function [^37000c2a].

> Now, I need to check uterine or outflow tract causes, which are less common but important. Asherman syndrome from intrauterine adhesions can cause secondary amenorrhea after instrumentation or infection; diagnosis relies on hysteroscopy or hysterosalpingography, and I should keep it in mind particularly after curettage or infection [^9871d281]. Cervical stenosis or other anatomic obstructions can also impede menstrual flow, though these are relatively infrequent in the secondary amenorrhea spectrum [^9cbd4fa8].

> But wait, what if the cause is systemic or iatrogenic? I should review medications and chronic disease. Combined hormonal contraception can cause withdrawal bleeding irregularities or amenorrhea, and after discontinuation, cycles may take time to normalize; I need to counsel that this is common and usually self-limited, though persistent irregularity warrants evaluation [^d6dccf8b] [^e0c1c0fd]. Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate suppresses ovulation and can delay return of menses for months after the last injection; I should confirm this expected delay and discuss alternative contraception if fertility is desired soon [^58950db6]. Chronic systemic illnesses such as uncontrolled diabetes, celiac disease, and chronic kidney disease can disrupt menstrual function via metabolic or endocrine effects, so I should screen for these when the history suggests them [^notfound]. I also need to remember that early pregnancy loss can present as a late, heavy period, and patients may not recognize it as a pregnancy event, which reinforces the need for sensitive pregnancy testing in any late menses scenario [^9b17da8b].

> Let me synthesize frequency so I prioritize the workup appropriately. In secondary amenorrhea, hypothalamic causes account for about 35%, ovarian causes about 40%, pituitary causes about 17%, and uterine/outflow causes about 7%; PCOS and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea dominate the ovarian and hypothalamic categories, respectively, which aligns with guideline summaries and supports starting with prolactin, TSH, and a reproductive hormone panel when pregnancy is excluded [^9cbd4fa8] [^e46fb782].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach and make sure I don't over-order tests. After excluding pregnancy, obtain a focused history covering cycle pattern, weight change, exercise, stress, galactorrhea, hot flashes, medications, and surgical or infectious uterine events; on exam, assess BMI, hirsutism, acanthosis, vitiligo, breast secretion, and pelvic findings. Initial labs should include hCG, TSH, prolactin, and a reproductive panel with FSH, LH, and estradiol to localize the defect to hypothalamic–pituitary, ovarian, or uterine levels; add testosterone, DHEAS, and metabolic labs if PCOS is suspected, and consider pelvic ultrasound if anatomic pathology is plausible or if the hormonal profile is indeterminate [^18e81a57] [^e46fb782].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate expedited evaluation. Any patient with new-onset secondary amenorrhea for 3–6 months, especially with hypoestrogenic symptoms or vasomotor changes, needs prompt assessment for primary ovarian insufficiency and estrogen deficiency sequelae; similarly, galactorrhea with amenorrhea suggests hyperprolactinemia and warrants pituitary imaging if confirmed, and post-pill or postpartum amenorrhea beyond expected timelines should trigger evaluation for persistent endocrine or anatomic causes rather than passive observation [^350e49e9] [^b6d01d1f] [^58950db6].

> I should also consider special populations and modifiers. In adolescents, immaturity of the HPO axis and PCOS are common, and cycles may take years to regulate; nonetheless, intervals beyond 45 days or more than 3 months between periods warrant evaluation and can unmask evolving endocrine disorders [^56c0518e] [^2a673a14]. In patients with obesity, insulin resistance and altered leptin signaling can worsen anovulation; weight management becomes a key therapeutic lever. In those with eating disorders or excessive exercise, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is likely and requires a multidisciplinary approach to restore energy balance and protect bone health [^37000c2a] [^13cc670a].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Non-pregnant causes of late or absent menses cluster into hypothalamic–pituitary dysfunction (notably functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease), ovarian disorders (PCOS, primary ovarian insufficiency), uterine or outflow tract abnormalities (Asherman syndrome, cervical stenosis), and systemic or iatrogenic factors (medications like depo-provera or combined pills, chronic disease, stress, weight extremes). A stepwise approach anchored by pregnancy testing, targeted history and exam, and a limited but strategic laboratory panel identifies the etiology in most cases and guides timely, cause-specific management [^9cbd4fa8] [^18e81a57] [^9871d281].

---

Late periods can result from **hormonal imbalances** (PCOS, thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia) [^e46fb782], **stress or excessive exercise** (functional hypothalamic amenorrhea) [^13cc670a], **weight changes** (rapid loss or gain, obesity) [^37000c2a], **chronic illnesses** (diabetes, celiac, liver/kidney disease) [^notfound], **medications** (hormonal contraception, antidepressants, antipsychotics) [^d6dccf8b], and **perimenopause** [^notfound]. Less common causes include **structural issues** (Asherman's, polyps, fibroids) [^notfound] and **genetic or endocrine disorders** (Turner, Cushing's) [^notfound]. Evaluation should start with a **pregnancy test** [^046be0d1], then assess history, exam, and targeted labs (TSH, prolactin, LH/FSH, androgens) [^18e81a57]; management is cause-specific, including lifestyle change, medication adjustment, or hormonal therapy [^13cc670a].

---

## Hormonal imbalances

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Irregular or absent periods due to anovulation; often with hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance [^339ef88c].
- **Thyroid disorders**: Hypo- or hyperthyroidism disrupts menstrual regularity via altered GnRH pulsatility [^e46fb782].
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Elevated prolactin suppresses GnRH, causing amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea [^b6d01d1f].
- **Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Stress, excessive exercise, or energy deficit suppress GnRH, causing amenorrhea [^13cc670a].

---

## Lifestyle and environmental factors

- **Stress**: Chronic stress alters HPA axis function, suppressing GnRH and delaying menses [^notfound].
- **Excessive exercise**: Low energy availability and stress suppress reproductive function [^notfound].
- **Weight changes**: Rapid loss or gain, and obesity, alter hormonal balance and ovulation [^37000c2a].
- **Travel and shift work**: Circadian disruption can delay ovulation and menses [^notfound].

---

## Medical conditions

- **Chronic illnesses**: Diabetes, celiac disease, liver or kidney disease, and inflammatory conditions can disrupt menstruation [^notfound].
- **Eating disorders**: Anorexia and bulimia cause hypothalamic suppression and amenorrhea [^notfound].
- **Perimenopause**: Hormonal fluctuations cause cycle irregularity before menopause [^notfound].

---

## Medications and substances

Medications and substances that can delay menses include **hormonal contraception** — such as pills, injections, or implants — which can cause breakthrough bleeding or amenorrhea [^d6dccf8b], and **psychiatric medications**, including antidepressants and antipsychotics, which can alter prolactin and menstrual timing. Chemotherapy may induce temporary or permanent ovarian suppression, and substances such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can subtly affect cycle regularity.

---

## Structural abnormalities

Structural abnormalities include **Asherman's syndrome** (intrauterine adhesions), which can cause amenorrhea or scanty bleeding, and **polyps or fibroids**, which may distort the endometrium and cause irregular bleeding.

---

## Genetic and endocrine disorders

Genetic and endocrine disorders include **Turner syndrome**, characterized by gonadal dysgenesis and primary amenorrhea, and **Cushing's syndrome**, in which excess cortisol disrupts menstrual function.

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Pregnancy test**: Always first to exclude pregnancy [^046be0d1].
- **History and exam**: Assess cycle pattern, stress, weight change, medications, and systemic symptoms [^18e81a57].
- **Laboratory tests**: TSH, prolactin, LH/FSH, androgens, and consider pelvic ultrasound if structural disease is suspected [^18e81a57].
- **Management**: Tailored to the cause — lifestyle modification, medication adjustment, or hormonal therapy (e.g. combined oral contraceptives, progesterone) [^13cc670a].

---

Late periods have diverse non-pregnant causes; a **structured evaluation** — pregnancy test first, then history, exam, and targeted labs — identifies the etiology and guides therapy.

3A. Menstruation and abnormal uterine bleeding

Hilary O.D. Critchley, MD; Jacqueline A. Maybin, PhD

I. The impact of menstrual bleeding complaints

Understanding the mechanisms underpinning the pivotal human event of menstruation is critical to our understanding of AUB. AUB, which includes the symptom of HMB, is a chronic complaint that affects the quality of life and well-being of 1 in 4 women of reproductive age (Figure 4). Previously, women experienced menstruation approximately 40 times owing to pregnancy and lactation amenorrhea, whereas in developed economies today, women can expect up to 400 menses in their lifetime. Therefore, AUB is becoming more common and problematic for women and society. In contemporary society, women are delaying having children for a variety of reasons such as personal choice, prioritization of career, and other factors that impose a delay in childbearing. Therefore, these women wish to preserve their uterus alongside their fertility. As a consequence, surgical options are not always appropriate because these end fertility and may also involve higher risks than medical management alternatives. In a recent systematic review relevant to the United States, it was conservatively estimated that annual direct and indirect economic costs of menstrual bleeding complaints were in the order of $1 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) are common, present in 70% to 80% of women by the age of 50 years, and associated with AUB or HMB. Among women in their 30s and 40s, leiomyomas are often the underlying cause of AUB, anemia, and iron deficiency anemia. When the presence of uterine fibroids is considered along with complaints of AUB, the annual estimated direct costs of this complaint in the United States, when surgery, hospital attendances, outpatient visits, and prescribed medications are taken into account, are as high as $4.1 billion to $9.4 billion. Furthermore, lost work hours resulted in costs ranging from $1.55 billion to $17.2 billion.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^046be0d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Addressing sex and gender to improve asthma management [^14cde438]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sex (whether one is 'male' or 'female', based on biological characteristics) and gender (defined by socially constructed roles and behaviors) influence asthma diagnosis and management. For example, women generally report more severe asthma symptoms than men; men and women are exposed to different asthma-causing triggers; men tend to be more physically active than women. Furthermore, implicit, often unintended gender bias by healthcare professionals (HCPs) is widespread, and may result in delayed asthma diagnosis, which can be greater in women than men. The sex and gender of the HCP can also impact asthma management. Pregnancy, menstruation, and menopause can all affect asthma in several ways and may be associated with poor asthma control. This review provides guidance for considering sex- and gender-associated impacts on asthma diagnosis and management and offers possible approaches to support HCPs in providing personalized asthma care for all patients, regardless of their sex or gender.

### Disorders of menstruation in adolescent girls [^c3ca53fc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal menstruation in adolescent girls can cause psychological and physical strain from excess, unpredictable, painful, or even absent bleeding. Care providers who understand what is normal and what is concerning can educate and often reassure the young woman and her family. When there is an abnormal or concerning scenario, they can initiate investigations and/or treatment in an expedient fashion to limit psychosocial and/or physical morbidity. This article provides pediatricians, family doctors, nurse practitioners, and adult gynecologists with the knowledge and understanding of the common complaints, differential diagnoses, and treatment strategies.

### Amenorrhea: evaluation and treatment [^1742464d]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

A thorough history and physical examination as well as laboratory testing can help narrow the differential diagnosis of amenorrhea. In patients with primary amenorrhea, the presence or absence of sexual development should direct the evaluation. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty commonly causes primary amenorrhea in patients with no sexual development. If the patient has normal pubertal development and a uterus, the most common etiology is congenital outflow tract obstruction with a transverse vaginal septum or imperforate hymen. If the patient has abnormal uterine development, müllerian agenesis is the likely cause and a karyotype analysis should confirm that the patient is 46, XX. If a patient has secondary amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. The treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhea is based on the causative factor. Treatment goals include prevention of complications such as osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and heart disease; preservation of fertility; and, in primary amenorrhea, progression of normal pubertal development.

### Current understanding of hypothalamic amenorrhoea [^13cc670a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HA is a common cause of amenorrhoea in women of reproductive age, which can go unrecognised. Thorough clinical evaluation is crucial in order to diagnose these women, establish the causative factor and initiate treatment appropriately. Treatment options need to be personalised and tend to focus on alleviating the underlying nutritional or psychosocial stress by lifestyle and behavioural interventions. Emerging hormonal therapies may prove useful in the future, especially in those women who do not respond to first-line behavioural treatment.

ACOG Committee Opinion — Epidemiology and vital sign rationale notes that despite variations worldwide and within the U.S. population, median age at menarche has remained relatively stable — between 12 years and 13 years — across well-nourished populations in developed countries, that a number of medical conditions can cause abnormal uterine bleeding characterized by unpredictable timing and variable amount of flow, and that by including an evaluation of the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign, clinicians reinforce its importance in assessing overall health status for patients and caretakers.

### Family planning and nutrition: systematic review of the effects of family planning on nutritional status of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age [^1257db08]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Overall, we found a lack of appropriate evidence to allow for strong and confident answers to our research questions about the relationships between use of FP and maternal nutrition outcomes. For many of our outcomes of interest, we were unable to conduct comparisons of contraceptive use to non-use of contraceptives due to the available study designs and data. Further, our intention was to investigate how FP exposure and interventions may change nutritional outcomes by reduction of maternal depletion through the pathways of delayed pregnancy, increased inter-pregnancy intervals, reduced parity and increased family income. However, among the included studies, none had long-term follow-up periods through multiple stages of reproductive life (eg, pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, post-partum, lactation). We are thus unable to draw conclusions regarding these longer-term mechanisms through which FP exposure or intervention is potentially related to nutritional outcomes. We are limited to more immediate pathways linked to changes to menstruation through contraceptive use. Similarly, we are unable to draw conclusions about how the duration of contraceptive use may be related to nutritional outcomes. In addition, nutrition-related outcomes were mostly reported as side effects of contraceptive use, including as reasons for discontinuation of use. As such, there is a high potential for selection bias due to differential lost to follow-up and confounding due to endogeneity in many of the available studies.

### Maternal body mass index and access to antenatal care: a retrospective analysis of 619, 502 births in england [^8553cf1f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

There is a lack of research exploring the potential influence of maternal body mass index (BMI) on access to antenatal care. Maternal weight status is categorised, using early- or pre-pregnancy BMI, as underweight (< 18.5 kg/m²), recommended weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m²), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m²) and obese (≥ 30 kg/m²). BMI is a significant predictor of maternal and perinatal health outcomes. For example, there is an increased risk of maternal and perinatal mortality, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pre- and post-term birth, stillbirth and congenital anomalies when mothers have a BMI in the overweight or obese ranges compared with women who have a BMI in the recommended range. There are also increased risks for mothers with an underweight BMI, including preterm birth and miscarriage. There are similarities between some of the adverse outcomes associated with BMI, and those associated with late access to antenatal care. For example, 33% of mothers who died in 2012–2014 had an obese BMI and a further 18% an overweight BMI. Epidemiological analyses of maternal obesity have also consistently shown significant associations with socio-demographic inequalities, similar to the inequalities in access to antenatal care such as deprivation and BME groups.

In addition to the similarity in socio-demographic factors and pregnancy outcomes among women with obesity and those accessing care late, there are also potential physiological and psycho-social associations. For example, there is a well-established association between obesity and delayed or avoidance of attendance for screening services, such as cervical and breast cancer screening. Pregnant women and non-pregnant patients describe delaying or avoiding accessing health services due to a history of negative interactions with health professionals about their weight, feeling blamed, and past experiences of obesity-related stigma within health service systems. There is potential for this phenomenon of delayed access to health services among obese populations to extend into antenatal care, although this is an under explored area of research. From a physiological perspective, both underweight and obesity can contribute to irregular menstruation including oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea and irregular uterine bleeding which may contribute to delayed realisation and confirmation of pregnancy, and subsequent delayed access to care.

### The correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3abaca48]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Menstruation serves as an indicator of women's reproductive well-being and plays a pivotal role in their fertility; nevertheless, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the epidemiological evidence linking menstrual characteristics as well as fertility.

Objective

To explore the correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane libraries to identify research articles published up until February 9, 2024.

Study Selection and Synthesis

We included all studies in which the relationship between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy rates among women of reproductive age was investigated. We excluded studies involving the administration of oral contraceptives, the application of assisted reproductive technologies, and individuals with a documented history of infertility or partners with a known history of infertility.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy and miscarriage.

Result(S)

This meta-analysis was composed of nine studies involving a total of 399,966 women, and the evidential quality derived from these studies was deemed to be high with a low risk of bias. Compared with a normal menstrual cycle length (25–32 days), the impact of a short (< 25 days) or long (> 32 days) menstrual cycle on a woman's pregnancy was relatively insignificant ([odds ratio {OR}, 0.81; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65–1.01; I², 68%] [OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75–1.06; I², 60%], respectively); however, a change in cycle length may increase the risk of miscarriage ([relative risk, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11–3.15; I², 0] [relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.57; I², 43%], respectively). In comparison to women experiencing menarche at a typical age (12–14 years), those with a late age at menarche (> 14 years) exhibited a decreased likelihood of pregnancy (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.91–0.93; I², 0%); and compared with women experiencing a normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4–7 days), those with a short duration of menstrual bleeding (< 4 days) exhibited reduced fertility potential (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84–0.88; I², 29%).

Conclusion(S)

Short and long menstrual cycle lengths may elevate women's susceptibility to spontaneous abortion, whereas late age at menarche as well as short duration of menstrual bleeding appear to be linked to diminished fertility among women of reproductive age.

### Hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor-1 α are required for normal endometrial repair during menstruation [^45a4912c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is common and debilitating, and often requires surgery due to hormonal side effects from medical therapies. Here we show that transient, physiological hypoxia occurs in the menstrual endometrium to stabilise hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and drive repair of the denuded surface. We report that women with HMB have decreased endometrial HIF-1α during menstruation and prolonged menstrual bleeding. In a mouse model of simulated menses, physiological endometrial hypoxia occurs during bleeding. Maintenance of mice under hyperoxia during menses decreases HIF-1α induction and delays endometrial repair. The same effects are observed upon genetic or pharmacological reduction of endometrial HIF-1α. Conversely, artificial induction of hypoxia by pharmacological stabilisation of HIF-1α rescues the delayed endometrial repair in hypoxia-deficient mice. These data reveal a role for HIF-1 in the endometrium and suggest its pharmacological stabilisation during menses offers an effective, non-hormonal treatment for women with HMB.

### Hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor-1 α are required for normal endometrial repair during menstruation [^76a70f0d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Excessive menstruation is common and debilitating, resulting in significantly decreased quality of life for women and a major socio-economic burden. Current medical treatments often have unacceptable hormonal side effects or are ineffective. We reveal that women with HMB have reduced endometrial HIF-1α and downstream targets and prolonged menstrual bleeding, suggestive of delayed endometrial repair. Herein, we detected hypoxia during active bleeding in the mouse model of simulated menses. Prevention of menstrual hypoxia decreased HIF-1α and delayed repair of the denuded endometrium. Deficient endometrial HIF-1α following P4-withdrawal in our mouse model was associated with delayed endometrial repair. Finally, we revealed that administration of DMOG (HIF stabiliser) at the time of simulated menstruation in our model of non-hypoxic menstruation significantly improved endometrial repair. These results confirm that pharmacological stabilisation of HIF-1α at menstruation has the potential to fulfil the unmet clinical need for a novel, non-hormonal therapeutic strategy for women with HMB.

As HIF has two transcriptionally active forms with distinct but overlapping target genes, we examined both subunits across the menstrual cycle. We found endometrial HIF-1α was present exclusively during the peri-menstrual phase (luteo-follicular transition), when vasoconstriction of spiral arterioles and local endometrial hypoxia are expected to occur. Endometrial HIF-2α was not present during menstruation, but only during the early to mid-secretory phase. This temporal pattern suggests HIF-2α does not have a key role in the regulation of menstruation, though it remains possible it may contribute to endometrial function at other stages. This is consistent with in vitro studies of breast cancer cells, where HIF-2α contributed to few, if any, of the transcriptional responses to acute hypoxia. We also revealed that women with objectively defined HMB (> 80 mL per cycle) had decreased endometrial HIF-1α protein and its downstream targets VEGF and CXCR4 during menstruation when compared to women with NMB. These carefully categorised tissues with linked objectively measured MBL suggest a role for hypoxia and HIF-1 in menstrual physiology and that aberrations may lead to HMB. Therefore, we utilised our mouse model of simulated menstruation to delineate the role of hypoxia and HIF-1α at menstruation.

### Menstrual induction with mifepristone and misoprostol [^f0dbebb2]. Contraception (2003). Low credibility.

Menstrual induction refers to early uterine evacuation without laboratory confirmation of pregnancy in women with delayed menses. Mechanical aspiration is the method used in many countries but, as suggested by a pilot study, mifepristone followed by a prostaglandin analogue could also be effective. We launched the present study to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of 150 mg of mifepristone, followed 2 days later by 0.4 mg misoprostol vaginally, for menstrual induction among women with a menstrual delay of up to 7 days. The outcome of treatment was uterine evacuation, which could mean menstruation or termination of early pregnancy. A total of 720 women were recruited. The mean delay of menstruation at recruitment was 4.9 (SD = 1.7) days. Retrospective analysis of human chorionic gonadotropin from serum samples taken at admission showed that 492 (68.3%) women were pregnant at admission, and 228 (31.7%) women had delayed menstruation without pregnancy. One nonpregnant woman was lost to follow-up. Bleeding was induced in 479 (97.4%) pregnant women and in 222 (97.8%) nonpregnant women. Among the pregnant women, 455 (92.5%) had complete abortion, 12 (2.4%) had incomplete abortion and pregnancy continued in 25 (5.1%) women, including one ectopic pregnancy. Side effects were mild and uncommon. We conclude that 95.8% of the women treated had the expected outcome. Further research is needed to compare the efficacy, safety and acceptability of the medical regimen to vacuum aspiration. A rather high continuing pregnancy rate in this study is a concern.

### Levonorgestrel (My way) [^e65e24e1]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

What should I do if my menstrual period is delayed beyond 1 week and I have severe lower stomach (abdominal) pain?

If you have severe lower stomach (abdominal) pain about 3 to 5 weeks after taking My Way, you may have a pregnancy outside the uterus, which is called a tubal pregnancy. A tubal pregnancy requires immediate medical treatment, so you should see a healthcare professional right away.

Can I use My Way for regular birth control?

No. My Way should not be used for regular birth control. It is an emergency or backup method to be used if your regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly or if you have sex without birth control. You should protect yourself against STDs and pregnancy every time you have sex. If you have unprotected sex again after taking My Way, it will not help protect you from getting pregnant.

How often can I use My Way?

My Way is meant for emergency protection only, and is not designed to be used frequently. If you find that you need to use emergency contraception often, talk to your healthcare professional and learn about methods of birth control and STD prevention that are right for you.

Will I experience any side effects from My Way?

When used as directed, My Way is safe for women. Some women will have mild, temporary side effects, such as menstrual changes, nausea, lower stomach (abdominal) pain, tiredness, headache, dizziness, breast pain and vomiting. These are similar to the side effects that some women have when taking regular birth control pills. Some women taking My Way will have menstrual changes such as spotting or bleeding before their next period. Some women may have a heavier or lighter next period, or a period that is early or late. If your period is more than a week late, you should get a pregnancy test.

### Menstruation: science and society [^731c54cb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Women's health concerns are generally underrepresented in basic and translational research, but reproductive health in particular has been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual physiology. Menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate. Yet for tens of millions of women around the world, menstruation regularly and often catastrophically disrupts their physical, mental, and social well-being. Enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena involved in menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, and other menstruation-related disorders will move us closer to the goal of personalized care. Furthermore, a deeper mechanistic understanding of menstruation-a fast, scarless healing process in healthy individuals-will likely yield insights into a myriad of other diseases involving regulation of vascular function locally and systemically. We also recognize that many women now delay pregnancy and that there is an increasing desire for fertility and uterine preservation. In September 2018, the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a 2-day meeting, "Menstruation: Science and Society" with an aim to "identify gaps and opportunities in menstruation science and to raise awareness of the need for more research in this field". Experts in fields ranging from the evolutionary role of menstruation to basic endometrial biology (including omic analysis of the endometrium, stem cells and tissue engineering of the endometrium, endometrial microbiome, and abnormal uterine bleeding and fibroids) and translational medicine (imaging and sampling modalities, patient-focused analysis of menstrual disorders including abnormal uterine bleeding, smart technologies or applications and mobile health platforms) to societal challenges in health literacy and dissemination frameworks across different economic and cultural landscapes shared current state-of-the-art and future vision, incorporating the patient voice at the launch of the meeting. Here, we provide an enhanced meeting report with extensive up-to-date (as of submission) context, capturing the spectrum from how the basic processes of menstruation commence in response to progesterone withdrawal, through the role of tissue-resident and circulating stem and progenitor cells in monthly regeneration-and current gaps in knowledge on how dysregulation leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and other menstruation-related disorders such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, and fibroids-to the clinical challenges in diagnostics, treatment, and patient and societal education. We conclude with an overview of how the global agenda concerning menstruation, and specifically menstrual health and hygiene, are gaining momentum, ranging from increasing investment in addressing menstruation-related barriers facing girls in schools in low- to middle-income countries to the more recent "menstrual equity" and "period poverty" movements spreading across high-income countries.

### Update in hyper-and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea [^4af71531]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Amenorrhea is a relatively common condition that is present in up to 5% of adult women at any time. The clinical significance of a lack of regular menstrual cycles extends beyond reproductive concerns. Episodes of amenorrhea as short as 90 d may have implications for bone and cardiovascular health. Prolonged amenorrhea, depending upon its underlying cause, can be a harbinger of substantial cardiovascular risk.

Materials and Methods

This is an update of recent medical literature on this topic.

Results

The past few years have been marked by a greater appreciation of the early presentation of common ovulatory disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and less common disorders, such as premature ovarian insufficiency/failure. The long-term implications of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and its genetic origins have also been further elucidated. Finally, health consequences of these and other menstrual disorders are increasingly well defined, with firmer clinical endpoints rather than merely risk factor assessments.

### "I can guess the month… but beyond that, I can' T tell" an exploratory qualitative study of health care provider perspectives on gestational age estimation in rajasthan, India [^ae92e742]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the challenges with widespread early access to ultrasound, gestational age estimation using last menstrual period remains a viable option for frontline health workers in low resource settings. However, this method yields accurate estimates only among women who had regular menstruation prior to pregnancy, something frontline healthcare providers may not account for. The proportion of pregnant women in low resource setting who have irregular or absent periods prior to pregnancy, which proscribes the use of LMP for gestational age estimation, is likely high due to undernutrition, hormonal disorders, early menopause, becoming pregnant again before postpartum menses regulates, and the use of many forms of contraception. Even among women who were menstruating regularly before becoming pregnant, communication about LMP is hindered by low client recall, poor client-provider rapport, shame around menstruation, and traditional approaches to timekeeping (harvests, festivals). Efforts to reduce shame and improve women's reproductive health knowledge may indirectly improve the use of LMP for gestational age estimation.

Late ANC reduces the likelihood that a woman will accurately recall the date of her last menstrual period and limits the capacity for ultrasound to produce an accurate gestational age estimate. ANC after the first trimester is common in many low and middle income countries, particularly among rural areas and among less educated women. Cultural norms around shame or bad omens influence when the news of a pregnancy can be shared with one's community: first ANC is delayed among women who wait until pregnancy is visible before talking to others, including health workers, often linked to an understanding that early pregnancy is a period of vulnerability. Women in South Africa and India have explained that they consider pregnancy a natural process with little risk to one's health (as opposed to labour, which has clear health risks), and thus does not require multiple or early ANC. Interventions have been moderately successful at changing these norms to increase ANC uptake through participatory community groups, as well as media campaigns, financial incentives, and home visits by healthcare providers.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^a57c8284]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with physical or cognitive disabilities or both — menstrual suppression is a safe and viable option for those who need or want fewer or no menses; although suppression should not be started until menarche, anticipatory guidance before menarche can be very useful and may lessen anxiety, and for patients with cognitive delay who may have trouble comprehending menstruation or maintaining hygiene, the approach should be comparable to neurotypical patients by starting with the lowest-risk and reversible options; gynecologists should educate patients based on cognitive abilities, maintain respect, maximize autonomy, avoid harm, and address patient and caregiver concerns.

### Menstruation: science and society [^e89c5d8a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

V. Current and future pathways

Moving forward, there is much left to be done, including addressing the menstruation-related issues faced by all those who menstruate, such as transmasculine and other populations; menstrual barriers faced in workplace contexts; recognition that more evidence is needed on vaginal bleeding across the life course, including the implications for the provision of water, sanitation, supplies, and access to healthcare and information; improved engagement of healthcare workers on the issue of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries in particular; the important intersection of menstruation and family planning; and improved measures for monitoring and assessing the impact of menstruation-focused interventions along with cost-effectiveness studies. Funding support has thus far been limited for addressing this broad spectrum of issues and for essential intervention and measures-related work that are needed to demonstrate critical associations between menstruation and population health more broadly. There is an urgent need for a strong funding stream to assure this impactful work can be done.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia: framing the issue [^c0e26ecb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

For girls and women in their reproductive years, the symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the most common cause of iron deficiency (ID), including the extreme manifestation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). It is recognized that these two clinical entities are not only ubiquitous, but their interrelationship is poorly appreciated and frequently normalized by society, healthcare providers, and affected girls and women themselves. Both HMB and ID/IDA adversely impact quality of life-HMB during the episodes of bleeding and ID daily as long as the ID exists. These combined issues undermine the lives of reproductive-aged girls and women of all ages, from menarche to menopause. At the same time, pervading culture and the often insidious nature of these disorders frequently lead to societal normalization, including by healthcare professionals. The effects on cognitive function as well as the related work and school absenteeism and presenteeism can undermine the efforts and function of women in all walks of life, be they students, educators, employers, or employees. There is also an increasing body of evidence suggesting that ID, even in early pregnancy, may adversely impact fetal neurodevelopment with enduring effects on a spectrum of cognitive and psychological disorders-effects that can have widespread impacts on society. Collectively, this critically important evidence begs the implementation of diagnostic and management guidelines aimed at identifying iron-deficient girls and women, repleting their iron stores, and, when present, effectively treating the most common reason for the problem-the various causes of the symptom of HMB.

PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy.

There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.

OVERDOSAGE

Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

OTHER INFORMATION

Your healthcare provider will take a medical and family history and examine you before prescribing oral contraceptives. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and your healthcare provider believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare provider if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare provider, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.

### Greater prevalence of anaemia and heavy menstrual bleeding reported in women of reproductive age in the United Kingdom compared to Australia [^b8f033b5]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Anaemia is common, affecting a quarter of the world population and disproportionately affecting non‐pregnant women (38%). The most common cause of anaemia is iron deficiency (ID)which, regardless of anaemia status, is known to cause non‐specific symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, shortness of breath, headache, hair loss and restless legs. Women are at an increased risk of ID during pregnancy due to increased iron demand. However, a common and often overlooked risk for iron deficiency is regular blood loss via menstruation. Around one in three women of reproductive age suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which occurs when there is > 80 mL of blood lost each menstrual cycle, which consequently increases the risk of developing ID.

The impact of HMB and ID is well documented but under‐recognized despite the impact on a woman's physical, emotional and social well‐being; mental and physical health and vitality; and overall impact on a woman's quality of life. Frequently normalized, HMB is often overlooked as a cause of ID, which in turn presents difficulties in differentiating symptoms from ID. Currently, screening for HMB and ID is not routinely performed for women of reproductive age.

A state of 'medical misogyny' was recently raised by the UK parliament, whereby the lack of awareness and education regarding menstrual health and female reproductive health conditions was flagged as problematic. In light of this, we have collated data gathered over the last decade of known risk factors for developing ID in reproductive‐aged women; where we have undertaken screening events in the community, at sporting events and Universities across both the United Kingdom and Australia.

Oral iron is the first‐line treatment for ID. It is affordable, effective and a readily available therapeutic option; however, gastrointestinal side effects are common and can result in a lack of therapeutic adherence in as many as half of women. This may explain the often long burden of iron deficiency, with many women suffering from iron deficiency for an average of 2 years. Due to a different mechanism of absorption, IV iron can be administered in a single, large dose, resulting in a quicker response time compared to oral iron therapy.

### Shining a light on endometriosis: time to listen and take action [^9a10596d]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis, an often severe and common chronic inflammatory condition, affects around 1 in 10 women of reproductive age worldwide. It can have devastating effects on women's physical and emotional well-being, quality of life, and reproductive health. Across the globe, March has been declared Endometriosis Awareness Month for a reason — it is time to increase awareness and education to allow for early diagnosis and eliminate the stigma surrounding this often-misunderstood condition. This editorial will shed light on endometriosis and explore why it is important to start listening and take action.

Endometriosis is characterized by tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus growing outside, usually in the pelvic area. During the menstrual cycle, this displaced tissue continues to thicken, break down, and bleed, just like the tissue inside the uterus, causing a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in scar tissue formation. Oftentimes, the endometrial tissue grows on pelvic organs such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the outside of the uterus, resulting in fibrotic lesions and adhesions. Notably, the extent of endometrial lesions does not necessarily correlate with the severity of symptoms. Patients can experience severe symptoms despite the absence of visibly large lesions and vice versa, and they can even be asymptomatic.

Patients with endometriosis often suffer from pain in diverse manifestations, such as chronic pelvic pain, painful periods, and pain during intercourse, ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain. Some patients may experience heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding and fatigue, possibly resulting from chronic pain and inflammation often associated with this condition. Even worse, endometriosis can compromise reproductive health and cause infertility, leading to problems in getting pregnant.

These symptoms vary broadly, and not all endometriosis patients may experience them with the same intensity. Some patients may not experience any symptoms at all, putting them even more at risk for a delayed diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms may also change over time and often, but not always, improve after menopause.

The symptomatic ambiguity and the lack of awareness of endometriosis among both patients and healthcare providers often lead to underdiagnosis and prevent timely treatment of this condition, which has significant social, public health, and economic implications. Severe pain, fatigue, and infertility can all contribute to a significantly impaired quality of life for those affected by endometriosis. In the worst cases, the debilitating pain prevents them from pursuing regular day-to-day activities and attending school or work. Moreover, their sexual health and partnerships might be affected by painful intercourse and infertility.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^bc721748]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ovulation timing and low-likelihood intervals for pregnancy risk assessment: During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20, and the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy; therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤ 7 days after an abortion. Among postpartum nonlactating women, the mean day of first ovulation occurred 45–94 days after delivery, with the earliest ovulation reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women within 6 months postpartum who are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥ 85%] of feeds are breastfeeds) and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is < 2%.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents — evaluation thresholds and indicators include that it is statistically uncommon to remain amenorrheic for more than 3 months or 90 days (the 95th percentile for cycle length), and girls and adolescents with more than 3 months between periods should be evaluated; experts typically report mean blood loss per period is 30 mL per cycle and chronic loss of more than 80 mL is associated with anemia; menstrual flow requiring product changes every 1–2 hours, particularly when lasting more than 7 days, is considered excessive; the diagnosis of pregnancy, sexual trauma, and sexually transmitted infections should be excluded.

### Building a network of sentinel centres for the care of women in an abortion situation: advances in Latin America and the caribbean [^6a29fddd]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Women who start contraceptive methods soon after the expulsion of products of conception have lower rates of unwanted pregnancies and subsequent abortions compared with women who delay starting contraceptives. However, women often have to wait for days until a new medical appointment is scheduled for counselling and establishment of a contraceptive method after abortion. This practice represents an unnecessary risk, since it is estimated that in 85% of women ovulation can return in the first month after abortion, even before they have an episode of menstruation.

### Risk factors associated with presenting for abortion in the second trimester [^a263c3dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine factors associated with delay of induced abortion into the second trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

Using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing, 398 women from 5 to 23 weeks of gestation at an urban hospital described steps and reasons that could have led to a delayed abortion. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent contributors to delay.

Results

Half of the 70-day difference between the average gestational durations in first- and second-trimester abortions is due to later suspicion of pregnancy and administration of a pregnancy test. Delays in suspecting and testing for pregnancy cumulatively caused 58% of second-trimester patients to miss the opportunity to have a first-trimester abortion. Women presenting in the second trimester experienced more delaying factors (3.2 versus 2.0, P < .001), with logistical delays occurring more frequently for these women (63.3% versus 30.4%, P < .001). Factors associated with second-trimester abortion in logistic regression were prior second-trimester abortion, delay in obtaining state insurance, difficulty locating a provider, initial referral elsewhere, and uncertainty about last menstrual period. Factors associated with decreased likelihood of second-trimester abortion were presence of nausea or vomiting, prior abortion, and contraception use.

Conclusion

Abortion delay results from myriad factors, many of them logistical, such as inappropriate or delayed referrals and delays in obtaining public insurance. Public health interventions could promote earlier recognition of pregnancy, more timely referrals, more easily obtainable public funding, and improved abortion access for indigent women. However, accessible second-trimester abortion services will remain necessary for the women who present late due to delayed recognition of and testing for pregnancy.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^e46fb782]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Causes of amenorrhea — prevalence and principal etiologies — The prevalence of amenorrhea not due to pregnancy, lactation, or menopause is approximately 3%–4%. Normal menstrual function requires four components (hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovaries, and genital outflow tract), and most cases are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. In specialized referral centers, approximately 5–20 patients per year were seen with primary amenorrhea annually. Amenorrhea may also occur with sexual ambiguity or virilization, and sexual ambiguity or virilization should be evaluated as separate disorders.

### Intermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in adolescent and adult menstruating women [^e097573d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet physiologic needs; it is caused by many conditions, particularly iron deficiency. Traditionally, daily iron supplementation has been a standard practice for preventing and treating anaemia. However, its long-term use has been limited, as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation, and teeth staining. Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for preventing and reducing anaemia at the population level, especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intermittent oral iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on anaemia and its associated impairments among menstruating women, compared with no intervention, a placebo, or daily supplementation.

Search Methods

In February 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and two trials registers. In March 2018, we also searched LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. In addition, we examined reference lists, and contacted authors and known experts to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were menstruating women; that is, women beyond menarche and prior to menopause who were not pregnant or lactating and did not have a known condition that impeded the presence of menstrual periods. The intervention was the use of iron supplements intermittently (one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) compared with placebo, no intervention, or the same supplements provided on a daily basis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies, checked data entry for accuracy, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 25 studies involving 10,996 women. Study methods were not well described in many of the included studies and thus assessing risk of bias was difficult. The main limitations of the studies were lack of blinding and high attrition. Studies were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one third of the included studies did not provide a funding source. Although quality across studies was variable, the results consistently showed that intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) compared with no intervention or a placebo, reduced the risk of having anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.87; 11 studies, 3135 participants; low-quality evidence), and improved the concentration of haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.19 g/L, 95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 15 studies, 2886 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and ferritin (MD 7.46 μg/L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 7 studies, 1067 participants; low-quality evidence). Intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 3 studies, 624 participants; low-quality evidence), but evidence was inconclusive regarding iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 1 study, 97 participants; very low-quality evidence) and all-cause morbidity (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; 1 study, 119 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women in the control group were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving intermittent iron supplements (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate-quality evidence). In comparison with daily supplementation, results showed that intermittent supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) produced similar effects to daily supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) on anaemia (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; 8 studies, 1749 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Intermittent supplementation may produce similar haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.43 g/L, 95% CI -1.44 to 2.31; 10 studies, 2127 participants; low-quality evidence) but lower ferritin concentrations on average (MD -6.07 μg/L, 95% CI -10.66 to -1.48; 4 studies, 988 participants; low-quality evidence) compared to daily supplementation. Compared to daily regimens, intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 1 study, 198 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women receiving iron supplements intermittently were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 6 studies, 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence). No studies reported on the effect of intermittent regimens versus daily regimens on iron deficiency anaemia and all-cause morbidity. Information on disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance was scarce, and evidence about the effects of intermittent supplementation on these outcomes unclear. Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings. Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria was frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings.

Authors' Conclusions

Intermittent iron supplementation may reduce anaemia and may improve iron stores among menstruating women in populations with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently is probably as effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression, and adherence to the intervention. The quality of this evidence base ranged from very low to moderate quality, suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc98b265]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Comments and evidence — ovulation timing and postpartum risk: During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20, and the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy; therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤ 7 days after an abortion. Among postpartum patients, the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery, with the earliest ovulation reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥ 85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is < 2%.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^7d338257]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^9c4c02bc]. Contraception (2023). High credibility.

Emergency contraception — pregnancy testing after EC is advised based on residual pregnancy risk and menstrual timing. EC is associated with pregnancy rates ranging from 0.009% to 2.6%. If an EC user experiences menses within two weeks of EC use, they can be reassured of their nonpregnant status; if not, a pregnancy test is recommended three weeks after EC use. Additionally, pregnancy testing should be considered one month following LNG IUD placement for EC given the potential for menstrual changes with this method. While pregnancy testing should be performed prior to IUD insertion for EC, EC should not be withheld or delayed for pregnancy testing. We recommend against withholding or delaying ECPs for pregnancy testing (GRADE 1B), and we recommend offering urine pregnancy testing for post-EC pregnancy assessment as needed (GRADE 1C).

### Maternal body mass index and access to antenatal care: a retrospective analysis of 619, 502 births in england [^37000c2a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

A recent review of the pathophysiology of obesity and menstrual disorders identified that obesity, especially central adiposity, was associated with increased oestrogen levels, circulating free testosterone, and with insulin levels which stimulates the production of androgens in ovarian tissue which can cause disruptions to normal ovulation and menstrual bleeding. Additionally, the association with menstruation disturbances was stronger for early onset obesity potentially due to the leptin levels which regulates the gonadotropin surge initiating pubertal stages. The association with menstrual disturbances may further contribute to late access to antenatal care due to delayed realisation about conception, particularly among women with central adiposity, or those who developed obesity during childhood. Qualitative research has also identified complex reasons for late access among socially excluded "hard to reach" groups of women. Haddrill et al. reported three themes to describe reasons for delayed access to antenatal care, including "not knowing" where women reported a lack of realisation about the pregnancy or beliefs that they were not pregnant (e.g. due to contraception use or maternal age); "knowing" including women who avoided or postponed access to antenatal care (e.g. due to fears or lack of perceived value of antenatal care); and being "delayed" including health professional and healthcare system failures (e.g. mis-estimation of gestational age, delays with referrals and appointments). A study for the UK Department of Health also grouped women into two distinct typologies: those who embraced their pregnancy such as women from Asian, Muslim, Somali and Romany communities; and those who were anxious about their pregnancy such as women who were homeless, drug and alcohol dependent, with learning difficulties and teenagers. The authors reported different reasons for delaying access to antenatal care between groups. Among those who embraced their pregnancy the family was a significant factor in their lives, and there were culturally defined roles of motherhood within society. Women were expected to continue their daily routine rather than seeking medical help as pregnancy was considered to just be part of life, or an act of God which was out of their hands. There was an emphasis on seeking medical advice from the family and distrust among certain groups of medical professionals. Our study identified the strongest associations with late access among women from BME groups, and previous studies in the UK report that South Asian women had fewer antenatal appointments and waited longer before seeking antenatal care when compared with White women, and women from BME groups report being insufficiently involved in decisions about their maternity care to have confidence and trust in the staff. However, among the population categorised as being anxious, reasons for late access related to difficulties accepting the pregnancy, or that accessing care was less important than other priorities such as finding housing. Similar to the group of women who embraced pregnancy, there was some distrust of medical professionals, plus fears of being labelled or referred to social services and having their baby taken into care. Extremely anxious women waited longer to seek antenatal care, particularly teenager mothers who reported feeling concerned about the associated stigma, fearful of health professionals informing their parents of the pregnancy, and relinquishing control. Previous studies have reported that teenage mothers are less likely to keep appointments or attend antenatal classes, and access maternity care later, which is also reflected in our analyses of teenage mothers and late access to care. Additional barriers to accessing care are inability to travel to appointments, language barriers for women who do not speak English, women with no fixed address who are not registered with a GP, and women with learning difficulties report being embarrassed to seek help as they did not understand written information leaflets. Although we were able to explore teenage pregnancy and maternal ethnic group in our analyses, the dataset did not include variables reflecting additional factors such as ability to speak English, learning difficulties or homelessness and therefore we could not explore these factors.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in the adolescent [^0facf221]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common problem in adolescents. The differential diagnosis varies from pregnancy and infection to anovulation and coagulopathy. Careful history and examination can help elucidate the best next steps for workup and management. Heavy menstrual bleeding is particularly worrisome in this group not only when it occurs at menarche, but also anytime afterward when bleeding lasts longer than 7 days, blood loss is greater than 80 mL per cycle, or other warning signs that indicate a history of heavy bleeding such as anemia. Once conditions of pregnancy, infection, structural abnormalities, and hormonal causes have been ruled out, first-line treatment is medical management with hormonal therapy or nonhormonal options. Invasive measures are a last resort in this patient population, because maintenance of fertility is of critical importance.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^0833e792]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. The criteria for determining whether a patient is pregnant depend on the assurance that the patient has not ovulated within a certain amount of time after their last menses, spontaneous or induced abortion, or delivery. Among menstruating patients, the timing of ovulation can vary widely. During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20. In addition, the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy. Therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤ 7 days after an abortion. A systematic review reported that the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery. In one study, the earliest ovulation was reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥ 85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is < 2%.

Although pregnancy tests often are performed before initiating contraception, the accuracy of qualitative urine pregnancy tests varies depending on the timing of the test relative to missed menses, recent sexual intercourse, or recent pregnancy. The sensitivity of a pregnancy test is defined as the concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at which 95% of tests are positive. Most qualitative pregnancy tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report a sensitivity of 20–25 mIU/mL in urine. However, pregnancy detection rates can vary widely because of differences in test sensitivity and the timing of testing relative to missed menses. Certain studies have demonstrated that an additional 11 days past the day of expected menses are needed to detect 100% of pregnancies using qualitative tests. In addition, pregnancy tests cannot detect a pregnancy resulting from recent sexual intercourse. Qualitative tests also might have positive results for several weeks after termination of pregnancy because hCG can be present for several weeks after delivery or abortion (spontaneous or induced).

### Factors associated with the timing of the first prenatal ultrasound in Canada [^d2a62673]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on the present study, only 68% of Canadian women received optimally timed prenatal ultrasounds. This is concerning because both over- and under-utilization of prenatal ultrasound can be problematic. The obvious consequences of overutilization lie in the cost associated with performing these tests, which can burden the healthcare system if used excessively, while underutilization may lead to missed opportunities for screening.

This study has found that, after adjusting for confounders, multiple maternal factors were associated with a higher likelihood of early but not late first prenatal ultrasound. Women who used fertility procedures or medications for this pregnancy were significantly more likely to have an early prenatal ultrasound. These women generally undergo more testing than other women do and require multiple ultrasounds in early pregnancy to check embryonic growth and development. Similarly, women who had pre-pregnancy or pregnancy conditions that warranted additional care during pregnancy may require earlier first prenatal ultrasounds than other women. In addition, underweight women were significantly more likely to have an early ultrasound. Obese women are more likely to access prenatal care late in pregnancy than non-obese women and are generally more likely to avoid or delay screening tests due to multiple factors including negative body image and to avoid weight loss advice, while underweight women are less likely to have late access to prenatal care. In addition to this, underweight women have a higher likelihood of irregular menstruation which may result in uncertain dates and, consequently, an earlier first prenatal ultrasound to establish gestational age. The present study also found that unintended pregnancy was significantly associated with increased likelihood of late ultrasound. This is in agreement with previous findings that women who have unintended pregnancies tend to have delayed prenatal care and possibly miss the window of an optimally timed prenatal ultrasound.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women receiving growth hormone replacement therapy enrolled in the nordiNet® international outcome study (IOS) and the American norditropin® studies: web-enabled research (ANSWER) program [^14945f19]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of pregnancy data and outcomes from two large non-interventional, real-world studies, NordiNet® IOS and the ANSWER Program, combining data from 47 pregnancies exposed to GH during pregnancy, provides insight into the use of GH replacement during pregnancy in real-world practice in Europe and the USA.

It is notable that, in NordiNet® IOS and the ANSWER Program, GHRT was at least partially continued at a constant dose during pregnancy for many women who became pregnant. Almost 79% of exposed pregnancies resulted in a normal delivery. Neonatal complications were not reported for this study. The observed termination rate (14.9%) was consistent with data from a study in Denmark that reported a 13.5% spontaneous abortion rate in the general population. However, spontaneous abortions could have been under-reported owing to denial, forgetfulness, misattribution as delayed menstruation, or because of a long delay between termination and the next clinical appointment with the endocrinologist. Despite limitations relating to missing information and potential under-reporting, data from NordiNet® IOS and ANSWER corroborate findings from previous reports, and provide additional real-world data about the safety profile of GHRT in pregnant adults with GHD. Three AEs were reported in two pregnancies, which were assessed to be unlikely to be related to the GHRT.

At the time of pregnancy, three different practices regarding GHRT were observed: discontinuation of the hormone replacement therapy, continuation of GH throughout pregnancy, and discontinuation of GHRT sometime during the first or second trimester. During pregnancy, pituitary GH decreases in the second trimester. Vila and colleagues suggest that gradually reducing GHRT to a complete cessation during the second trimester could better mimic normal physiology in pregnant women with GHD. As pregnancies in these patients are rare, the question of whether and when to discontinue GH replacement is a key clinical issue in this patient population. There may be concerns about continuing GH replacement for too long or discontinuing too early, as most women with GHD can experience difficulty becoming pregnant and could have an increased risk of abortion.

This study has numerous strengths. NordiNet® IOS and ANSWER were not constrained by a highly specific protocol (as clinical trials are), and so offer an inclusive picture of the use and effectiveness of GHRT in clinical practice. Thus, these studies provide real-world evidence of the outcomes of GH use in pregnant women.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^c33ba6d9]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) is a clinical diagnosis associated with an abnormal luteal phase length of ≤ 10 days. Potential etiologies of LPD include inadequate progesterone duration, inadequate progesterone levels, or endometrial progesterone resistance. LPD has not only been described in association with medical conditions but also in fertile, normally menstruating women. Although progesterone is important for the process of implantation and early embryonic development, LPD has not been proven to be an independent entity causing infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss. Controversy exists regarding the multiple proposed measures for diagnosing LPD and, assuming it can be diagnosed accurately, whether treatment improves outcomes. This document replaces the document entitled "Current clinical irrelevance of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion", last published in 2015 (Fertil Steril 2015;103:e27-e32).

PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE

When taken correctly without missing any pills, oral contraceptives are highly effective; however the typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.

 PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy.

There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.

 OVERDOSAGE

Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional.

 OTHER INFORMATION

Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.

### Committee opinion no. 651 summary: menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^87283a4e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite variations worldwide and within the U.S. population, median age at menarche has remained relatively stable-between 12 years and 13 years-across well-nourished populations in developed countries. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic conditions, nutrition, and access to preventive health care, may influence the timing and progression of puberty. A number of medical conditions can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, characterized by unpredictable timing and variable amount of flow. Clinicians should educate girls and their caretakers (eg, parents or guardians) about what to expect of a first menstrual period and the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns in adolescence may improve early identification of potential health concerns for adulthood. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding of the menstrual patterns of adolescent girls, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate the adolescent girl patient. By including an evaluation of the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign, clinicians reinforce its importance in assessing overall health status for patients and caretakers.

### Successful twin pregnancy in a patient with lupus erythematosus on hemodialysis: a case report and literature review [^7432cf9d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to irregular menstruation and hormonal state in ESRD, detection of pregnancy is often delayed, in the mean to 16.5 WOG. This can bear deleterious effects on fetal development, e.g. due to continuation of teratogenic medication – as happened to our patient previously – or delay of a beneficial intensification of dialysis.

Augmentation of HD time from < 18 h/week to 37–56 h/week during gestation was related to a significant increase in live birth rate (85% vs. 48%), gestational age at delivery (38 vs. 28 weeks) and median birth weight (2.6 kg vs. 1.8 kg), but means a high burden for the patient. Some authors consider it sufficient raising the dialysis dose to at least 20 h/week to achieve a serum BUN level below 50 mg/dL, but state a further augmentation to 24 h/week as beneficial. We chose a HD dose (25 h/week to 27.5 h/week) which led to a good outcome of 100% live birth rate in another setting. Evidently, the extent of maternal uremia rather than the duration of dialysis itself largely determines the pregnancy outcome in dialysis patients. Serum BUN levels and both birth weight and gestational age were negatively correlated: BUN levels < 48–49 mg/dL (≈ serum urea 102 mg/dL) corresponded to a birth weight > 1500 g and a gestational age > 32 WOG. Maternal uremia is thought to cause a fetal solute diuresis resulting in polyhydramnios, which itself can lead to premature birth, so there is a recent trend to target even lower BUN levels < 35 mg/dL. In our case, most blood tests showed completely normal pre-dialysis serum urea values of 20–48 mg/dL and polyhydramnios did not occur. A similar reduction of uremia by nocturnal dialysis of 48 ± 5 h/week could achieve almost full term pregnancies. We see both birth weight and gestational age in our case acceptable compared to the data reported in non -twin dialysis pregnancies.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^0c90b00c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Some fertility apps are based on sophisticated algorithms for individualised identification of the fertile window relying on physiological parameters such as BBT which are more acceptable for large numbers of women. Whilst LH test kits have been used to determine the day of ovulation for decades, they have a significant margin of error when used in isolation. The addition of BBT and the use of a fertility app may help to narrow down testing days and therefore be more convenient and cheaper. Individualised identification of the fertile window based on BBT and menstruation dates can help to reduce the time to conception in some cases.

With women globally delaying fertilitythe potential value of fertility tracking apps as a platform for delivery of individualised fertility education and preconception care should not be underestimated. Anecdotally there is poor understanding of fertility amongst the general population, which can lead to both unintended pregnancies and delayed time to conception with associated psychological suffering for those wishing to start a family. Fertility education delivered through an app has the potential to improve doctor–patient interactionsand communication between partners. The value of fertility apps as educational platforms to achieve public health benefits through standardised health promotion messages during key stages of reproductive life such as preconception, pregnancy and birth spacing is also being explored.

Finally, the widespread use of mobile phone apps for personal health monitoring is generating large amounts of data on the menstrual cycle. Provided that the real-world data can be validated against traditional clinical studies done in controlled settings, there is enormous potential to uncover new scientific discoveries. This is one of the largest ever analyses of menstrual cycle characteristics. These initial results only scratch the surface of what can be achieved. We hope to stimulate greater interest in this field of research for the benefit of public health.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome underdiagnosis patterns by individual-level and spatial social vulnerability measures [^339ef88c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinology among reproductive-aged women, contributes a significant economic and health burden through its effects on reproductive, metabolic, and psychosocial health. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated to be between 6% and 12% in the United States. In 2020 alone, PCOS was associated with healthcare costs of ∼$8 billion in the United States. PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in reproductive-aged women, and women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its associated comorbidities, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, throughout their life course.

Despite potential serious implications, many women who meet diagnostic criteria for PCOS remain undiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis. The Rotterdam Criteria for diagnosis, established in 2003, requires 2 out of the 3 cardinal features of PCOS: irregular menstruation, symptoms of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism) or lab tests for biochemical androgen excess, and the presence of ovarian cysts on transvaginal ultrasound. According to current guidelines, if a provider suspects a patient has PCOS, they will inquire about relevant symptoms including menstrual cycle irregularity, hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss, and weight gain. If PCOS is suspected but not confirmed symptomatically, after ruling out other endocrinopathies that present with similar symptoms, a provider may order a test for biochemical hyperandrogenemia or a pelvic ultrasound to check for polycystic ovarian morphology to confirm diagnosis. After receiving a PCOS diagnosis, a patient ideally receives access to counseling around menstrual and uterine health, information about potential comorbidities and prevention strategies, and tailored fertility care during periods of attempted conception.

### Menstrual cycle-related exacerbation of disease [^5a7d997b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Exacerbation of common medical and mental health disorders at specific phases of the menstrual cycle is a prevalent phenomenon. Although the precise cause is unclear, studies implicate complex interactions between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. The menstrual cycle also is a trigger for the onset of depressive disorders, including premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a disorder specific to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and depression associated with the transition to menopause. This article discusses common mental health problems exacerbated by the menstrual cycle, with a particular focus on premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression. Throughout the reproductive lifespan, routine screening and assessment for the presence of common psychiatric disorders are critical for accurate diagnosis and provision of effective treatment. Management options include referral or consultation with a primary care provider or psychiatrist; treatment options for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression include pharmacotherapy with antidepressant agents and/or psychotherapy. Hormones may be helpful.

### Clinical evaluation before… [^07ceac22]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

While waiting to start a new birth control method, many women become pregnant unintentionally. Tradition determines that women delay starting hormonal contraceptives until the next menses, until a certain number of weeks have passed after childbirth, or until a breastfeeding infant is weaned. In addition, many physicians delay prescribing contraceptives for women who have not had a recent physical examination and Papanicolaou smear. Unintended pregnancy poses significant health risks to women and their families — it is associated with higher rates of domestic violence, maternal drug and alcohol use during pregnancy, delayed prenatal care, and low birth weight. Office Visits Between Menses When women request birth control at an office visit occurring between menses, many physicians delay starting hormonal contraceptives. Waiting until the next menses provides assurance that the woman is not already pregnant when she begins the new method.

This practice probably began in order to avoid exposing a fetus to hormones, before studies had evaluated teratogenicity. Now there is a large body of evidence that refutes this risk; combined estrogen/progestin contraceptives do not cause birth defects. 4 A more limited body of evidence indicates that hormonal contraceptives taken in early pregnancy cause no significant increase in the risks of miscarriage or fetal growth problems. 5–7 Concern that hormones can mask the symptoms of early pregnancy, thus delaying diagnosis and leading to a later abortion or later onset of prenatal care, can be addressed through appropriate use of urine pregnancy tests, consideration of emergency contraception, and use of backup contraception during the first week of hormonal contraceptive use.
8. Lactation As in the postpartum phase, contraceptive choice during lactation depends on the length of time since childbirth and on the type of hormone selected.

WHO advises against hormonal contraception use during the first six weeks postpartum in women who are breastfeeding because of concerns about the potential effects of steroids on liver and brain development in neonates. From six weeks to six months postpartum, the risk of diminished quantity and quality of breast milk may outweigh the benefits of estrogen-containing contraceptives. Lactation itself prevents pregnancy in the first six months postpartum in women who remain amenorrheic and whose babies get 90 percent or more of their calories from breast milk. However, a recent review of lactational amenorrhea as a contraceptive method found pregnancy rates ranging from 0 to 7. 5 percent, 21 pointing to the need to explore contraceptive options even with women who are breastfeeding exclusively.

HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of combination oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are:

menstrual cycles may become more regular
blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur.
pain or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently
ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently
noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently
acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently
oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus.

### "I was waiting for my period": understanding pregnancy recognition among adolescents seeking abortions in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Zambia [^21e86107]. Contraception (2023). Medium credibility.

3.3 Factors that delayed pregnancy recognition

Adolescents gave several reasons why they did not rely on a single factor, sign, or symptom in recognizing their pregnancy. Many adolescents had multiple missed periods before recognizing a pregnancy. Particularly in Ethiopia, some adolescents bought multiple medical pregnancy tests, increasing the cost of pregnancy recognition:

At home, I tested my urine and there were two lines, but the other one was not clear to identify. So, I bought the testing kit three times.

19-year-old, Ethiopia, abortion at the recruitment facility, nulliparous

Prior irregular menstruation, as well as recent menarche, meant adolescents did not connect changes in menstruation to a pregnancy:

Int: As you told me before, your pregnancy was more than three months, why were you late to terminate the pregnancy?

R: Because I did not know about my pregnancy. I was waiting for my period, but it did not happen as usual.

18-year-old, Ethiopia, abortion at the recruitment facility, nulliparous

Not recognizing that signs or symptoms could be associated with a pregnancy was a major contributor to delayed recognition. For some adolescents, symptoms such as vomiting (n = 58 [18.5%]), breast tenderness (n = 30 [9.6%]), and nausea (n = 29 [9.3%]) were commonly reported but not understood as signs of a pregnancy. For others, the association of symptoms with other conditions (e.g. malaria, typhoid) limited the extent to which adolescents reported that they suspected they could be pregnant:

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (bekyree) [^d6dccf8b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DAY 1 START

Counting the first day of menstruation as "Day 1", tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days. For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last yellow tablet. [If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]

If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, non-functional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If both pregnancy and pathology have been excluded, time or a change to another preparation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.

LPD has been described with medical conditions and also in fertile women with normal menstruation, and although progesterone is important for implantation and early embryonic development, LPD has not been demonstrated as an independent entity causing infertility or recurrent miscarriage. There is controversy regarding multiple proposed diagnostic measures and, even if accurately diagnosed, whether treatment improves outcomes. This document replaces a prior opinion last published in 2015.

### Menstrual bleeding: perspective of Brazilian women [^ca80f14b]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Menstrual patterns, induced amenorrhea and the use of some contraceptive methods which induce non-bleeding are issues under debate among health professionals and women. The objective of the study was to describe perspectives and attitudes of Brazilian women regarding menstruation and its interference in daily activities.

Study Design

A semistructured questionnaire was applied to nonpregnant, nonlactating women between 18 and 45 years old, who were menstruating, consulting at public health services for other complaints than gynecological or reproductive health care, and staff members and teachers of public universities in one city of each geographic region of Brazil and the Federal District.

Results

Of the 885 women interviewed, 51.5% were aged 20–29 years, almost 60% reported normal frequency of bleeding, 22% and 43% reported interference of menstruation in their school activities and in the relationship with their partner, respectively. The value attributed to each interference (< 5; ≥ 5; in a scale up to 10) was > 5 for more than 60% of the women in all evaluated domains. The most common reason for disliking menstruation was inconvenient and/or discomfort, and for liking menstruation were feeling healthy and confirmation of not being pregnant. The variables associated to liking menstruation were attending < 8 years of school and low economic class, having more than one child and no history of premenstrual tension.

Conclusion

A great proportion of the interviewed women disliked having menstruation even when they did not present menstrual-related problems. However, some women still preferred monthly menstruation because they felt healthy and it was a free pregnancy test.

PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE

Combined Oral Contraceptives

The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately one percent (i.e., one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are 5%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.

PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy.

There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.

OVERDOSAGE

Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional or pharmacist.

OTHER INFORMATION

Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.

Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills.

HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of combined oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are:

menstrual cycles may become more regular
blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur.
pain or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently
ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently
noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently
acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently
oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy — pregnancy, nursing, and fertility counseling (Recommendation 43): Female patients of reproductive age receiving RAI therapy should have a negative screening evaluation for pregnancy prior to RAI administration and avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after receiving RAI. (Good Practice Statement) RAI should not be given to nursing female patients; treatment should be deferred until lactating women have stopped breast-feeding or pumping for at least 3 months, and a diagnostic 123I scan may be performed in recently lactating women to detect breast uptake. (Good Practice Statement) Male patients receiving cumulative radioiodine activities ≥ 14.8 GBq (400 mCi) should be specifically counseled regarding potential risks of infertility, and female patients receiving RAI should be counseled that such therapy has not been shown to impact future fertility. (Good Practice Statement) Treatment with 131I is contraindicated during pregnancy; temporary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea occurs in 8–27% of menstruating women within the first year after RAI for DTC, and while long-term rates of infertility, miscarriage, and fetal malformation do not appear elevated, one large cohort found delayed childbearing and lower later birth rates; another study suggested postponing pregnancy for 1 year after RAI due to miscarriage risk, although this was not confirmed subsequently.

### The clinical rationale for menses-free contraception [^835799ae]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

The impact of monthly menstruation may range from a minor inconvenience for some women to a major health concern for those who suffer from menstrual disorders and health conditions that are aggravated during their menstrual cycle. Oral contraceptives (OCs) have been used safely in continuous regimens for the treatment of menstrual disorders in some women and for others who choose to extend their 28-day menstrual cycle to accommodate major life events. There is no physiological requirement for the monthly hormone withdrawal bleed that is experienced by women taking cyclic OCs or for a menstrual period in women who do not desire to (or cannot) become pregnant. Thus, the use of continuous or extended-cycle OC regimens that eliminate the menstrual cycle represents a viable and attractive option for many women. The availability of more choices for menstrual suppression, such as continuous use of OCs, will improve the quality of life for many women who suffer from menstrual-related disorders and provide greater convenience for women with busy and active lifestyles.

### Go the distance: reproductive health care for people with sickle cell disease [^e236af15]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This overview of reproductive and sexual health care concerns for people with sickle cell disease (SCD) addresses clinical concerns that can be complex and are inherently multidisciplinary. Clinicians must be prepared to initiate reproductive health care discussions, as these intimate concerns may not be volunteered by patients. SCD is associated with delayed onset of puberty, sickle pain during menstruation, disease-specific contraceptive considerations, high-risk pregnancy, priapism, erectile dysfunction, and offspring who inherit a hemoglobinopathy trait from affected parents. Reproductive health considerations are underrecognized, undertreated, and understudied. They need attention in primary care and specialty SCD, urology, and obstetrics and gynecology clinics.

5.7	Weight Gain

Weight gain is a common occurrence in women using depo-subQ provera 104. In three large clinical trials using depo-subQ provera 104, the mean weight gain was 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) in the first year of use. In a small, two-year study comparing depo-subQ provera 104 to DMPA-IM, the mean weight gain observed for women using depo-subQ provera 104 [7.5 lb (3.4 kg)] was similar to the mean weight gain for women using DMPA-IM [7.6 lb (3.5 kg)].

Although there are no data related to weight gain beyond 2 years for depo-subQ provera 104, the data on DMPA-IM may be relevant. In a clinical study, after five years, 41 women using Depo-Provera CI (150 mg) had a mean weight gain of 11.2 lb (5.1 kg), while 114 women using non-hormonal contraception had a mean weight gain of 6.4 lb (2.9 kg).

5.8	Delayed Return of Ovulation or Fertility

Return to ovulation is likely to be delayed after stopping depo-subQ provera 104, as demonstrated in a study of 15 women who received multiple doses of depo-subQ provera 104:

Median time to ovulation was 10 months after the last injection.
Earliest return to ovulation was 6 months after the last injection.
12 women (80%) ovulated within 1 year of the last injection.

However, ovulation has occurred as early as 14 weeks after a single dose of depo-subQ provera 104; therefore, administer the next depo-subQ provera 104 12 to 14 weeks after the last injection.

Return to fertility also is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy. Among 28 women using depo-subQ provera 104 for contraception who stopped treatment to become pregnant, 7 women were lost to follow-up. One woman became pregnant within one year of her last injection and another woman became pregnant 443 days after her last injection. The remaining 19 women had not become pregnant; it is not known if these 19 women were still attempting to become pregnant or if they had started a new contraceptive method.

### Approach to the patient with new-onset secondary amenorrhea: is this primary ovarian insufficiency? [^350e49e9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Menstrual cyclicity is a marker of health for reproductively mature women. Absent menses, or amenorrhea, is often the initial sign of pregnancy-an indication that the system is functioning appropriately and capable of generating the intended evolutionary outcome. Perturbations of menstrual regularity in the absence of pregnancy provide a marker for physiological or pathological disruption of this well-orchestrated process. New-onset amenorrhea with duration of 3 to 6 months should be promptly evaluated. Secondary amenorrhea can reflect structural or functional disturbances occurring from higher centers in the hypothalamus to the pituitary, the ovary, and finally, the uterus. Amenorrhea can also be a manifestation of systemic disorders resulting in compensatory inhibition of reproduction. Identifying the point of the breakdown is essential to restoring reproductive homeostasis to maintain future fertility and reestablish reproductive hormonal integrity. Among the most challenging disorders contributing to secondary amenorrhea is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). This diagnosis stems from a number of possible etiologies, including autoimmune, genetic, metabolic, toxic, iatrogenic, and idiopathic, each with associated conditions and attendant medical concerns. The dual assaults of unanticipated compromised fertility concurrently with depletion of the normal reproductive hormonal milieu yield multiple management challenges. Fertility restoration is an area of active research, while optimal management of estrogen deficiency symptoms and the anticipated preventive benefits of hormone replacement for bone, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive health remain understudied. The state of the evidence for an optimal, individualized, clinical management approach to women with POI is discussed along with priorities for additional research in this population.

### Determinants of non-adherence to iron folic acid supplementation among pregnant women attending public health facilities in bishoftu town, Ethiopia: case-control study [^b4eeecf2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-adherence to iron folic-acid supplementation among pregnant women is a common public health problem in developing countries, particularly in low-income countries, and it is associated with serious adverse health outcomes. The non-adherence to iron-folic acid can occur when pregnant women in all settings should not receive 30–60 mg of iron element and 400 μg (0.4 mg) folic acid during pregnancy, due to late or non-initiation of the supplements, suboptimal implementation of the dosing regimen, or early discontinuation of adherence to iron-folic acid supplementation. Iron folic acid intake among pregnant women is a core process indicator of the global nutrition monitoring framework that helps to halt the burden of iron deficiency anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder in the world and pregnant women are especially at risk.

Globally, about 41.8% of pregnant women worldwide are anemic and iron deficiency anemia alone accounts for 22% of all anemia deaths. The most common causes of anemia are poor nutrition, deficiencies of iron, micronutrient deficiencies including folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin B12. Iron deficiency anemia is estimated to affect 38.2% of pregnant women globally, with the highest prevalence in the regions of South-East Asia at 48.7% and Africa 46.3%.

Women of reproductive age are at particular risk due to menstruation, whereas pregnancy and childbirth results in a net iron loss of 580 to 680 mg because of fetal and placental requirements and bleeding during delivery, in young children, rapid expansion in red cell mass results in very high dietary iron requirements. It is also responsible for some pregnancy complications, such as neural tube defects, including spinal bifida and anencephaly, fetal malformation, type 2 diabetes, and obesity in the newborn.

As many as 80% of reproductive-aged women experience physical changes associated with menstruation, and 20% to 40% experience menstrual-cycle-related symptoms. Decades of research in women with menstrual disorders, such as dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, have shown that continuous use of oral contraceptives (OCs), without the hormone-free interval, is a safe and effective method to relieve these symptoms and ultimately induce amenorrhea in many women. If given the opportunity, a majority of women would opt for extended-cycle or continuous regimens, and numerous clinical trials have shown that continuous OC regimens induce amenorrhea in 80% to 100% of women by 10 to 12 months of use. For women who do not wish to become pregnant, a continuous OC regimen should be an available option.

### Which appendicitis scoring system is most suitable for pregnant patients? A comparison of nine different systems [^6d6a7df3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of non-obstetric emergency surgery in pregnant women. Appendicitis occurs in one out of 1500 pregnant women. Furthermore, negative appendectomy rates in females of reproductive age are reported to be up to 26%. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain during pregnancy is more complicated than in typical patients. In addition to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which are common during pregnancy, an increased white blood cell (WBC) count and limited radiological methods complicate the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, negative appendectomy rates remain relatively high regardless of the testing conducted.

The main goals in the diagnosis of appendicitis are to reduce negative appendectomy rates, avoid perforation, and protect the patient from unnecessary surgical intervention. A meta-analysis reported that it is essential to make an exact diagnosis and avoid any delay therein. However, another article reported that a delay in the diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis of up to 24 h is safe. That article stated that non-operative management through antibiotic treatment is safe in cases of uncomplicated appendicitis. Unfortunately, the rates of abortion and preterm labor are significantly higher in women with appendicitis. Timely diagnosis is critical, as delays may lead to both maternal (1–4%) and fetal (1.5–35%) mortality due to perforation of the appendix. To this end, various scoring methods have been developed based on imaging studies, clinical findings, and laboratory results. The present study aimed to evaluate the extent to which these scoring methods are suitable for the diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy.

### Intermittent iron supplementation for reducing anaemia and its associated impairments in menstruating women [^885f0897]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Daily iron supplementation has been traditionally a standard practice for preventing and treating anaemia but its long term use has been limited as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation and teeth staining. Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for preventing and reducing anaemia at population level, especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intermittent oral iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on anaemia and its associated impairments in menstruating women, compared with no intervention, a placebo or daily supplementation.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in May 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years), Science Citation Index (1970 to 27 May 2011), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to current), and CPCI-S (1990 to 27 May 2011). On 7 July 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, metaRegister and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also contacted relevant organisations (on 11 October 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were menstruating women, that is women beyond menarche and prior to menopause who were not pregnant or lactating and did not have a known condition that impeded the presence of menstrual periods. The intervention was the use of iron supplements intermittently (one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) compared with no intervention, a placebo, or the use of same supplements on a daily basis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies, checked data entry for accuracy and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.

Main Results

We included 21 trials involving 10,258 women. Although the quality across trials was variable, the results consistently show that in comparison with no intervention or a placebo, intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) reduces the risk of having anaemia (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95, 10 trials) and improves the concentration of haemoglobin (MD 4.58 g/L; 95% CI 2.56 to 6.59, 13 trials) and ferritin (MD 8.32 μg/L; 95% CI 4.97 to 11.66, six trials). However, in comparison with daily supplementation, women receiving supplements intermittently presented anaemia more frequently (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.51, six trials), despite achieving similar haemoglobin concentrations on average (MD -0.15 g/L; 95% CI -2.20 to 1.91, eight trials). Information on disease outcomes, adherence, side effects, economic productivity and work performance is scarce and the evidence about the effects of intermittent supplementation on them is unclear. Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings. Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria is frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings.

Authors' Conclusions

Intermittent iron supplementation in menstruating women is a feasible intervention in settings where daily supplementation is likely to be unsuccessful or not possible. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently is less effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression and adherence to the intervention.

### Perception of pregnant women towards early antenatal visit in Fiji: a qualitative study [^e25f9ec5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstetric factors

Delayed diagnosis of pregnancy was another cited factor that postponed booking. Many women interviewed said that they were not aware of being pregnant and because pregnancy was diagnosed late, they came late for ANC booking.

Some women reported having the "normal" cycle irregularity which delayed their access to early antenatal care while a few did not notice signs such as amenorrhea as the cardinal sign of pregnancy.

"… unsure initially if pregnant or not… I always miss my period for two to four months but this time more than 5 months… " (27yr FI G3P2)

Moreover, some pregnant women recognized their pregnancy late because of conceiving while lactating or continued to have menstruation even after conception.

"… no signs of pregnancy unlike with the other kids… i am breastfeeding so unsure as wasn't having any menses… only last week Friday pregnancy test was done… " (22yr old IT G2P1)

One woman had attributed her delay on timely booking to failure of family planning. Therefore, lack of knowledge about the chances of getting pregnant while on family planning and the time frame for the side-effects of family planning medicine to disappear delayed accessing ANC service.

"… on family planning doc, was on Jadelle which just got removed. So, didn't expect to be pregnant… " (25yr old G5P4)

Child spacing was another barrier for multiparous pregnant women to timely initiation of ANC. Participants who had younger children reported that they had to plan for children before they could come for booking.

"… my two kids going to school. Have to look after the youngest one who is 2 years of age… today I arrange my sister to look after him so I came… " (26yr old IT G4P3)

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^55871dec]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Several studies have been published in the last year using assumed or estimated menstrual cycle phases. These phases are 'generated' solely on regular menstruation. As more of these studies are published, founded on data that was not actually measured, it becomes imperative to grasp the difference between what is measured versus what is assumed or estimated. We need to measure, not guess, to draw valid and meaningful conclusions in a research topic that is riddled with considerable debate over contradicting outcomes. Hence, this editorial is a call to action directed at editors and reviewers. It is intended to raise the quality, practical implications, application and integrity of future studies investigating the effect of menstrual cycle phases on a given outcome. We do not intend to focus on individual papers but want to ensure that female populations can use their reproductive data accurately and effectively.

### The pediatric clinician's approach to adolescent reproductive health in females with sickle cell disease [^4446f98c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

With improvements in health care, most females with sickle cell disease (SCD) are surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Delayed onset menarche, increased risk of acute vaso-occlusive pain associated with menstruation and dysmenorrhea, and increased odds of pregnancy-related complications are prevalent in females with SCD. Significant knowledge gaps exist in the management of reproductive health issues in adolescent females with SCD. This article highlights the pediatric clinicians' approach to essential reproductive health issues such as menarche, acute vaso-occlusive pain temporarily associated with menstruation and dysmenorrhea, and pregnancy in adolescent females with SCD.

Emergency contraception (EC) with 10 mg mifepristone can prevent pregnancy up to 5 days after a single act of unprotected intercourse. No methods have been shown to be effective when treatment is administered more than 5 days after a single unprotected act or after several unprotected acts. Therefore, we tested, among 699 Chinese women requesting EC and exposed to the risk of pregnancy described, the potential of 100 mg mifepristone followed 2 days later by 0.4 mg misoprostol orally, when administered in the luteal phase of the cycle. At the time of treatment urinary pregnancy test had to be negative. Despite treatment, 25 women (2.7%) became pregnant. Among women with treatment delayed more than 5 days, the pregnancy rate was related to the number of acts of intercourse before treatment, being 1.4% with one episode and increasing to 6.5% when the number of episodes was two or more (relative risk = 4.62, 95% CI: 1.06–20.18). Side effects within a week after treatment were mild, and most women (57.2%) had menstruation within 3 days as expected. An occasional treatment with mifepristone in combination with misoprostol could provide an option for preventing unwanted pregnancies in women who are late for EC.

### Current clinical irrelevance of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^7c056537]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) has been described in healthy normally menstruating women and in association with other medical conditions. Although progesterone is important for the process of implantation and early embryonic development, LPD, as an independent entity causing infertility, has not been proven. This document replaces the document by the same name, last published in 2012 (Fertil Steril 2012;98:1112–7).

### Hyperprolactinemia and infertility [^b6d01d1f]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are a common cause of amenorrhea and infertility in premenopausal women. The goals of therapy are to normalize prolactin, restore gonadal function and fertility, and reduce tumor size, and dopamine agonists are the preferred therapy. Clinically significant tumor enlargement during pregnancy is uncommon and dependent on tumor size and prepregnancy treatment.

### Period problems: disorders of menstruation in adolescents [^2c6293ca]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Adolescence is a time of great psychological and physical change. In the UK, girls enter puberty around the age of 10 years with a median age of menarche of 12.9 years; thereafter, it may be several years before regular menstrual cycles are established. Variations in the type and the frequency of periods may create anxiety regarding ill health or serious underlying disorders. With the increase in childhood obesity and subsequent polycystic ovary syndrome, there is a greater awareness and presentation of girls with disorders of menstruation. This review focuses on normal variations of menses and common pathological causes of menstrual problems, including amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia. Further consideration is given to the variations of presentation of polycystic ovary syndrome. It provides a guide to evaluate the various symptoms, investigations and management options.

### Applying reflective multicriteria decision analysis to understand the value of therapeutic alternatives in the management of gestational and peripartum anaemia in Spain [^8a590861]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide, being present in 29% non-pregnant women, 38% pregnant women, and more than 40% of children. Data for the prevalence of anaemia in Europe reports rates of 11% (6–20) for children under 5 years old, 16% (12–22) for non-pregnant women aged 15–49, and 22% (16–29) for pregnant women between 15–49 years old, this data is in accordance with a national study reporting a prevalence of 22.6% of anaemia in pregnant women aged 16–43. Women are specially affected by IDA due to blood loss caused by menstruation. During pregnancy, anaemia is common due to higher requirements of iron and the effect of haemodilution caused by an increase in plasma volume. IDA during pregnancy has been reported to be associated with intra- and postpartum haemorrhage and transfusion need and it is not just the mother who is affected by IDA but the new-born as well, as iron deficiency affects growth and organ functioning, the immune system is also altered, and neurodevelopmental impairments and predisposition to postnatal iron deficiency have been reported.

Routine clinical care for these patients has been oral iron, normally ferrous sulphate (FS), and intravenous (IV) iron in those cases of severe IDA or newly diagnosed pregnant women beyond 34 weeks of pregnancy because of its rapid effectiveness in rising iron levels to correct the anaemia before labour as it is likely to result in excessive bleeding, post-labour anaemia, and use of blood products such as blood transfusion. In Spain, a guide on the management of IDA in pregnancy, follows this same approach of using oral iron when possible and IV iron for those moderate-severe, non-responder, or last minute cases. Nevertheless, a study carried out in a Spanish hospital about the use of IV iron reported that 24.82% of the patients requiring this treatment were related to the obstetric department.

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) was approved in Spain in 2008 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2007 and its labelled indications are: oral iron non-responder patients, when oral iron cannot be used, and when there is an urgent need for iron. Specifically for pregnant women, FCM can be only administered in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy and even though its clinical benefits above oral iron have been demonstrated in several clinical trials it is not widely used, what seems to be driven by its higher acquisition cost.

### Evaluation and management of amenorrhea [^9871d281]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstrual periods in women.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of amenorrhea is complex and multifactorial. It can be caused by hormonal disorders such as pituitary dysfunction and absent ovarian function. It can also be caused due to chromosomal abnormalities and impairment of GnRH pulsatile secretion.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence rates of primary and secondary amenorrhea in the general population are estimated at 0.3% and 3–4%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, amenorrhea presents as the absence of menstrual periods. In primary amenorrhea, there is also an absence of secondary sexual characteristics in phenotypic women aged ≥ 14 years. In secondary amenorrhea, there may be other associated symptoms depending on the underlying cause. For example, patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may present with severe bradycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, and/or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is reversible, and normal menstrual function can be restored with appropriate treatment. Amenorrhea due to chromosomal abnormalities or primary ovarian insufficiency may not be reversible.

### Non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women with bleeding disorders [^efe1a0f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding without an organic lesion is mainly due to an imbalance of the various hormones which have a regulatory effect on the menstrual cycle. Another cause of heavy menstrual bleeding with no pelvic pathology, is the presence of an acquired or inherited bleeding disorder. The haemostatic system has a central role in controlling the amount and the duration of menstrual bleeding, thus abnormally prolonged or profuse bleeding does occur in most women affected by bleeding disorders. Whereas irregular, pre-menarchal or post-menopausal uterine bleeding is unusual in inherited or acquired haemorrhagic disorders, severe acute bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding at menarche and chronic heavy menstrual bleeding during the entire reproductive life are common. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of non-surgical interventions versus each other, placebo or no treatment for reducing menstrual blood loss in women with bleeding disorders.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (25 August 2016), Embase (May 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trial registry (February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies of non-surgical interventions for treating heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women of reproductive age suffering from a congenital or acquired bleeding disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

Three cross-over studies, with 175 women were included in the review. All three studies had an unclear risk of bias with regards to trial design and overall, the quality of evidence generated was judged to be poor. Two of the studies (n = 59) compared desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) with placebo. Menstrual blood loss was the primary outcome for both of these studies. Neither study found clear evidence of a difference between groups. The first of these reported a mean difference in menstrual blood loss in the desmopressin versus placebo group of 21.20 mL (95% confidence interval -19.00 to 61.50)The second study reported that even though there was an improvement of pictorial bleeding assessment chart scores with desmopressin and placebo when compared to pretreatment assessment, there was no clear evidence of difference in these scores when the two were compared to each other (results presented graphically, P = 0.51). The data from these studies could not be combined. The third study (n = 116) compared desmopressin with tranexamic acid (n = 116). This study found a decrease in pictorial bleeding assessment chart scores after both treatments as compared to baseline. The decrease in these scores was greater for tranexamic acid than for desmopressin, with a mean difference of 41.6 mL (95% confidence interval 19.6 to 63) (P < 0.0002). In relation to adverse events, across two studies, there was no clear evidence of a difference when placebo was compared to desmopressin, risk ratio 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 3.34). The same was also true when desmopressin was compared to tranexamic acid, risk ratio 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 3.34). Only the study that compared desmopressin to tranexamic acid assessed quality of life. However, we are unable to present any data from this study, since no differences in this outcome between the two intervention groups were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from randomised controlled studies on the effect of desmopressin when compared to placebo in reducing menstrual blood loss is very limited and inconclusive. Two studies, each with a very limited number of participants, have shown uncertain effects in menstrual blood loss and adverse effects. A non-randomised comparison in one of the studies points to the value of combining desmopressin and tranexamic acid, which needs to be tested in a formal randomised controlled study comparison. When tranexamic acid was compared to desmopressin, a single study showed a reduction in menstrual blood loss with tranexamic acid use compared to desmopressin. There is a need to evaluate non-surgical methods for treating of menorrhagia in women with bleeding disorders through randomised controlled studies. Such methods would be more acceptable than surgery for women wishing to retain their fertility. Given that women may need to use these treatments throughout their entire reproductive life, long-term side-effects should be evaluated.
