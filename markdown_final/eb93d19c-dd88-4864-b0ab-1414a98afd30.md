## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an interpretation of an MRI of the cervical spine that reports degenerative changes greatest at C5–6 with focal severe central stenosis (right > left), cord compression, and a "subtle myelopathic cord signal abnormality", plus implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnosis and whether these MRI findings represent degenerative cervical myelopathy rather than an incidental compressive change. Then, I should analyze the anatomic level and pattern of compression. Next, I will scrutinize what "subtle" intramedullary signal likely means pathologically and prognostically, and cross-check this against the literature. After that, I need to correlate the imaging with clinical features and consider diagnostic limitations and advanced imaging tools. Finally, I will examine management thresholds, surgical timing and approach, prognosis modifiers, and conclude with practical recommendations and knowledge gaps.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnosis. Severe focal canal stenosis at C5–6 with cord compression and intramedullary signal change constitutes the classic triad of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM): canal narrowing, mechanical cord compression, and parenchymal injury, making DCM the leading global cause of adult spinal cord dysfunction and strongly favoring a pathologic rather than incidental process [^1161pkAJ].

> I will now examine the anatomic and mechanical context. The C5–6 level is a typical degenerative hot spot, and "severe central stenosis R > L" implies anteroposterior canal compromise below critical thresholds that are strongly associated with cord contour deformity and compression, with population data indicating a CDdisc under 9.9 mm markedly increases the odds of cord compression even in nonmyelopathic volunteers, which I should keep in mind when correlating with symptoms [^115mSw5r].

> Hold on, I should verify the biological consequences of compression at this stage. Chronic mechanical compression precipitates microvascular compromise, blood–spinal cord barrier dysfunction, neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss, which together underpin progressive neurological decline in DCM; this pathophysiologic cascade supports why intramedullary signal change — however "subtle" — matters clinically [^1161pkAJ] [^116xa8nx].

> Next, I should review what "subtle myelopathic cord signal" likely represents. Wait, let me verify whether this implies faint T2 hyperintensity without T1 hypointensity; if so, that pattern typically maps to edema and early demyelination rather than established myelomalacia, and tends to be more reversible after decompression than sharply marginated or multilevel changes or combined T2/T1 abnormalities, which portend chronicity and poorer recovery [^1132Bf2m] [^115GZzKb] [^112zAvmu].

> Let me consider prognostic nuance from the signal phenotype. Focal, sharply delineated "snake-eye" patterns and multilevel T2 hyperintensity are linked with worse outcomes, whereas diffuse, blurry single-level T2 hyperintensity is more consistent with edema and better potential for improvement; moreover, higher quantitative signal change ratios (for example SCR > 1.46) independently predict poorer surgical recovery, so I should check if such quantitation is available for this case [^1132Bf2m] [^1132N82S] [^11773oRw]. Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost concluded that any T2 change predicts better outcomes than no change, but that is not consistently supported; large cohort analyses suggest T2-only hyperintensity has similar outcomes to no-signal groups, whereas T1 hypointensity plus T2 hyperintensity is clearly worse, so I should not overstate a "paradoxical" benefit of subtle T2 alone without context [^112zAvmu] [^1132N82S].

> I need to ensure rigorous clinical correlation because stenosis and even cord contour changes can be incidental. Prevalence studies show MRI cord compression is common in adults over 40, but symptomatic myelopathy is relatively infrequent; thus, I must look for typical DCM features such as hand clumsiness, numbness, gait imbalance, hyperreflexia, long-tract signs, and sphincter disturbance, and I should be alert to dynamic worsening with neck flexion or extension, which can accentuate cord impingement beyond neutral-position imaging [^115mSw5r] [^114RvLNn] [^111E9EDb] [^1148XUKi].

> I should double-check the reliability of calling a signal "subtle". Visual grading of intramedullary changes has only moderate interrater reliability, so observer bias is a concern; automated, objective quantification — such as the T2 Myelopathy Index or standardized T2-SI variability metrics — can reduce rater dependency and better stratify disease stages, and advanced modalities like DTI, phase-contrast CSF flow, or even FDG-PET may expose microstructural injury, dynamic obstruction, or metabolic activity that refine diagnosis and prognosis in equivocal cases [^112axQrT] [^1126sNtn] [^115rFHkF] [^111wa6MA] [^114mh9aH] [^111A395B].

> Now, I need to evaluate management implications without jumping to conclusions. Severe stenosis plus cord compression plus intramedullary signal change usually places the patient at least in a moderate-risk category where surgical decompression is recommended to halt progression, with earlier intervention associated with better functional recovery; surgical approach selection hinges on the number of affected levels, sagittal alignment, and ventral versus dorsal pathology dominance, and should be individualized in a surgical consultation [^1161pkAJ] [^116xa8nx] [^111jJime]. But wait, I should also weigh the nonoperative trajectory: natural history data show substantial deterioration over several years in symptomatic patients managed conservatively, supporting timely decompression when clinical myelopathy is present and not mild or stable [^112TSoxC] [^111rgMR1].

> Let me think about prognosis with this imaging pattern. Favorable elements include single-level disease at C5–6 and the absence of reported T1 hypointensity, both aligning with potentially reversible edema, while unfavorable modifiers include longer symptom duration and older age, which independently blunt recovery; quantitative T2 signal ratios, if elevated, would also signify higher risk of incomplete postoperative improvement [^11773oRw] [^117Xhdy6] [^112zAvmu] [^1132N82S]. I should confirm the symptom timeline, baseline mJOA, and any multilevel subtle changes to refine the estimate of recovery potential [^112zAvmu].

> I should now translate this into concrete diagnostic and therapeutic steps. Let me first confirm a detailed neurological examination with mJOA scoring, correlate lateralizing signs with the right-greater-than-left compression at C5–6, and obtain urgent spine surgery consultation given the combination of severe stenosis, cord compression, and intramedullary signal change; if diagnostic uncertainty persists or symptoms seem disproportionate, consider adjunct imaging such as DTI or standardized T2-SI quantification, and counsel the patient that surgery aims to halt progression and often improves function but cannot reverse established myelomalacia [^1161pkAJ] [^111wa6MA] [^116xa8nx]. If the finding were truly incidental and the patient asymptomatic — which I should verify carefully — close clinical surveillance with activity modification and interval imaging would be reasonable, recognizing that conservative care has limited utility once clear myelopathy is present [^112TSoxC].

> Finally, I should review knowledge gaps and next steps to strengthen decision-making. Standardized MRI protocols and automated metrics like the T2 Myelopathy Index can reduce interobserver variability and may yield prognostically relevant thresholds; dynamic assessments and neurophysiologic adjuncts can unmask position-dependent compression; and exploratory biomarkers such as perioperative monocyte dynamics may eventually refine recovery prediction, though these remain investigational and should not delay indicated decompression [^1126sNtn] [^115rFHkF] [^111E9EDb] [^1148XUKi] [^111hCk4R].

> In summary, this MRI most likely represents clinically significant DCM centered at C5–6 with early, "subtle" intramedullary change consistent with edema or early demyelination rather than established myelomalacia, making this a surgically amenable lesion at a potentially reversible stage; urgent clinical correlation and timely decompression are warranted to prevent progression, with prognosis tempered by symptom duration, age, and any quantitative signal burden, and with right-predominant compression expected to map to lateralized signs on examination [^1161pkAJ] [^1132Bf2m] [^116xa8nx].

The MRI shows **severe central canal stenosis at C5-C6** with **right-dominant cord compression** and **subtle T2 cord signal abnormality**, consistent with early degenerative cervical myelopathy. This pattern reflects mechanical cord injury with early edema or demyelination [^1132Bf2m]. The right-greater-than-left asymmetry suggests more pronounced right-sided symptoms. Given the severity of stenosis and the cord signal change, **surgical decompression is recommended** [^1161pkAJ] to prevent progression [^114mGYrE] and stabilize or improve neurologic function.

---

## MRI findings and clinical correlation

- **Degenerative changes at C5-C6**: Degenerative disc disease, osteophytes, and ligamentous hypertrophy [^112GhXG5] are typical at C5-C6 and can cause significant canal narrowing and cord compression.

- **Severe central canal stenosis**: Severe stenosis reduces canal diameter, compressing the cord and causing neurologic deficits such as weakness, sensory loss, gait instability, and sphincter dysfunction [^1161pkAJ].

- **Right-dominant cord compression**: Asymmetric compression often produces more pronounced right-sided symptoms, including weakness, sensory changes, and hyperreflexia.

- **Subtle myelopathic cord signal abnormality**: T2 hyperintensity indicates early cord edema or demyelination [^1132Bf2m] from chronic compression, correlating with myelopathy severity and prognosis [^112zAvmu].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

- **Progression of neurological deficits**: Without treatment, chronic cord compression can cause progressive myelopathy, including weakness, sensory loss, gait instability, and sphincter dysfunction [^112TSoxC].

- **Prognostic significance of MRI findings**: T2 hyperintensity reflects early cord injury and is associated with worse baseline severity and reduced recovery potential [^112zAvmu], especially if multilevel or combined with T1 hypointensity [^1132N82S].

- **Risk of permanent neurological impairment**: Persistent compression with cord signal change increases the risk of irreversible deficits if not promptly addressed [^1161pkAJ].

---

## Recommended management strategies

- **Surgical decompression**: Surgery is the standard of care for moderate-to-severe myelopathy or progressive deficits [^1161pkAJ], aiming to halt progression and improve function [^114mGYrE].

- **Timing of surgery**: Early decompression is recommended to prevent irreversible cord injury and optimize outcomes [^116xa8nx].

- **Surgical approach**: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is often preferred for focal anterior compression at C5-C6 [^115kMZw6], while posterior approaches may be considered for multilevel or posterior disease [^111jJime].

- **Postoperative rehabilitation**: Structured rehabilitation is essential to maximize functional recovery and quality of life.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Delayed or inadequate treatment can cause **neurological deterioration** [^112TSoxC], with worsening myelopathy and permanent deficits. Surgery carries risks such as **infection, bleeding, nerve injury, and adjacent segment disease** [^116f2fvi]; however, in severe myelopathy, the **benefits generally outweigh these risks** [^114mGYrE]. Some patients may experience persistent or recurrent symptoms due to irreversible cord injury or ongoing degeneration [^112zAvmu].

---

## Summary and recommendations

The MRI demonstrates severe right-dominant central canal stenosis at C5-C6 with cord compression and subtle T2 signal change, consistent with early degenerative cervical myelopathy. **Prompt surgical decompression** is recommended [^1161pkAJ] to prevent progression and improve neurologic function, with ACDF often preferred for focal anterior compression [^115kMZw6]. Early intervention and rehabilitation are critical to optimize outcomes and reduce the risk of permanent impairment [^112zAvmu].

The radiological assessment in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) remains challenging and requires further improvement due to the restricted correlation between imaging alterations and the clinical severity of affected patients, as well as controversial prognostic utilization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice because of its highest tissue resolution and advanced measurements to characterize spinal cord function. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted sequences are routinely applied for characterizing the anatomical configuration of the spinal canal, the compression of neuronal tissue, and for identifying pathological intramedullary signal alterations.

Hyperintensities within the spinal cord on T2-weighted images and hypointensities on T1-weighted images are associated with obvious clinical myelopathy. Their occurrence is of prognostic relevance, predominantly associated with poor clinical outcomes with or without surgical therapy, especially in sharply delineated ("snake-eye") or multilevel T2 signal increases, and when T2 and T1 myelopathy signs occur combined. Only slightly blurry, delineated, or postoperatively disappearing T2 hyperintensities are postulated to have better clinical outcomes than the aforementioned intramedullary signal aberrations.

The character of the intramedullary signal change seems to reflect the progressive tissue destruction in DCM, starting with intramedullary edema and local demyelination, eventually leading to necrosis and spinal cord atrophy. In contrast, there are reports within the literature that statin…

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy - update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs, and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the aging population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability.

Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes.

Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management, and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

### Surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy: A nationwide registry-based observational study with patient-reported outcomes [^114RvLNn]. Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive spine disorder and the most common cause of spinal cord impairment in adults over 55 years. The cervical spine is prone to degenerative changes such as disk herniation, ligament hypertrophy or ossification, and osteophyte formation that may lead to spinal cord compression and dysfunction. DCM should be considered in patients over 50 years with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck, pain and numbness in limbs, poor coordination, imbalance, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and bowel and/or urinary incontinence. As nonspecific and subtle initial early features of DCM overlap with other neurological conditions, it is frequently challenging to catch the diagnosis early. Lack of awareness and incomplete neurological assessments can also delay diagnosis, increasing patients' risk of developing lifelong disability and impaired quality of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice to detect spinal cord compression with or without intramedullary signal abnormalities, and electrophysiologic testing can sometimes help exclude alternative diagnoses. Incidental degenerative changes in the cervical spine with spinal cord compression are commonly encountered on MRI and do not correlate well with the severity of symptoms. As the oldest sector of the population continues to grow and wishes to remain active, physicians will be required to manage an increasing number of patients with degenerative changes in the spine and DCM.

### Systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging characteristics that affect treatment decision making and predict clinical outcome in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1152bFpe]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This study was designed as a systematic review with the objective of determining whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy impact treatment decisions or predict postsurgical outcomes and adverse events. Although the role of MRI in confirming the clinical diagnosis and guiding surgical management for cervical spondylotic myelopathy is well established, its potential as a prognostic tool remains largely unexplored.

A systematic search was conducted using PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library, covering articles published between January 1, 1956, and November 20, 2012. The overall body of evidence for each clinical question was evaluated based on guidelines provided by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group, as well as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommendations.

The initial search resulted in 268 citations, with twenty publications meeting all inclusion criteria for the review. Among these, three publications assessed MRI predictors for clinical deterioration in cases receiving conservative treatment, while seventeen evaluated MRI anatomic or cord characteristics that could forecast surgical outcomes or adverse events. There is low evidence to suggest that a high signal intensity (SI) grade on T2WI is linked with patient deterioration during conservative treatment. Furthermore, high SI grade on T2WI, compression ratio, and canal diameter were not significant predictors of outcome.

### Predicting the risk of adjacent segment pathology in the cervical spine: a systematic review [^116f2fvi]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The study design is a systematic review. The objective of the review was to determine the risk and define potential identifiable risk factors for the development of adjacent segment pathology (ASP) after cervical fusion surgery.

During the past several decades, the indications for spinal arthrodesis have expanded, with a dramatic increase in the rate of cervical spine fusion in the United States. As more of these procedures are performed over time, concerns have been raised about the potential for patients to develop changes at levels adjacent to the index procedure. Questions remain regarding whether the development of clinical ASP (CASP) is iatrogenic in nature or part of the natural history.

A systematic review of the literature was carried out for articles published in English between 1990 and March 15, 2012. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify articles reporting risk factors for CASP after cervical fusion. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the overall quality of the literature using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

The results identified 5 studies (4 retrospective cohorts, 1 database study) that met the inclusion criteria from a total of 176 possible studies for review. The prevalence of CASP ranged from 11% to 12% at 5 years, 16% to 38% at 10 years, and 33% at 17 years. Factors that may contribute to these outcomes were also examined.

### Magnetic resonance T2 image signal intensity ratio and clinical manifestation predict prognosis after surgical intervention for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^117SyByU]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

The study design involved a retrospective imaging study of 73 patients who underwent surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) between April 2005 and July 2007.

The objective was to investigate whether magnetic resonance (MR) T2 image signal intensity (SI) ratio and clinical manifestation can assess the prognosis in patients with CSM.

The association between intramedullary high SI on T2-weighted MR images and surgical outcome in CSM remains controversial. The means of quantizing SI ratio for the disease has not been discussed.

Methods included enrolling a total of 73 patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. They were treated with anterior, posterior, and posterior-anterior united decompression. All patients underwent 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging before surgery. T2-weighted images of sagittal increased SI on the cervical spinal cord were obtained, with regions of interest (ROIs) taken by 0.05 cm. Additionally, T2-weighted MR images of sagittal normal cord SI on the cervical regions between C7-T1 disc levels were obtained, with ROIs taken by 0.3 cm. SI value is measured by computer, and the SI ratio between the 0.05 cm and 0.3 cm regions was calculated. If no intramedullary high SI was noted on T2-weighted MR images, the ROIs were taken by 0.05 cm of the severe compression cord. All patients were divided into three groups through hierarchical clustering analysis based on the SI ratio: Group 1 (low SI ratio), Group 2 (middle SI ratio), and Group 3 (high SI ratio). Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 11.0.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115ki6zy]. Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

Figure 5 depicts two exemplary segments at level C5/6 with a typical T2-SI curve for a patient showing high signal variability (red curve) and a healthy volunteer with a nearly linear curve (blue). The extent of the variability might reflect the dimension of intramedullary alterations and is expected to be associated with the severity of myelopathy symptoms and anticipated outcome after treatment. All three parameters reflecting the T2-SI variability have the advantage of grading alterations within the spinal cord in a more dedicated, metric setting, rather than dealing with binary or ordinal subjective scales. Therefore, a better correlation to the clinical affection and different stages of DCM is expected.

A limitation of this data is that we show isolated radiological parameters without linking them to clinical affection. It is expected that, associated with mentioned prior evaluations, the extent of the signal variability correlates with clinical impairment, which is already the subject of further clinically centered investigations. Independently of the clinical correlation, this evaluation procedure works fully automated without dealing with rater dependency, and it is applicable for every high-resolution T2-weighted sequence in advance, which represents a new step in the radiological assessment of DCM.

Figure 5 provides an example of the spinal cord segmentation procedure for cervical level C5/6 and the corresponding T2 signal intensity (T2-SI) curves of two representative subjects for both groups: the signal intensity curve for a T2-positive patient (red) shows a higher range and therefore variability of the T2-SI.

### New diffusion metrics for spondylotic myelopathy at an early clinical stage [^113m5kBa]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

This study was conducted between 28 October 2010 and 25 February 2011 and involved 50 consecutive patients at our institution (22 male, 28 female; mean age 58 years; age range 20–86 years) who exhibited clinical signs and symptoms indicative of early cervical myelopathy. Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and ethics approval was secured from the institutional review board before commencing the study.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) the presence of other intraspinal diseases; (b) the presence of abnormal intensity in the spinal cord on conventional MR imaging (T1- or T2-weighted imaging); (c) a history of neck surgery for any disease; and (d) unsatisfactory image quality for calculating diffusion metrics.

### Effect of spinal cord signal intensity changes on clinical outcome after surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1132N82S]. Journal of neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of intramedullary T2 high signal intensity changes in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) indicates the existence of a chronic spinal cord compressive lesion. However, the prognostic significance of signal intensity changes remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of spinal cord T2 signal intensity changes on the outcome after surgery for CSM.

In a prospective study, 64 patients with CSM who underwent surgical treatment between October 2006 and April 2008 using an anterior approach were included. Based on the clinical symptoms and signs present, the severity of neurological deficits of all patients was scored according to a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale score for CSM just before the surgery and at 6 months follow-up. Recovery rates were calculated at 6 months.

There were 22 patients who did not have spinal cord intensity changes on MR imaging and 44 who demonstrated high-intensity signal changes on T2-weighted images (focal or segmental). No statistically significant differences were found in recovery rates between cases with T2 signal intensity changes and those with no signal intensity changes. However, the postoperative modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale scores and the recovery rates were much lower in patients with multisegmental signal intensity changes compared with those without these changes or those with focal signal intensity change, and ANOVA demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### Clinical evidence for cervical myelopathy due to Chiari malformation and spinal stenosis in a non-randomized group of patients with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^115zR94b]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

While patients with fibromyalgia report symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy, a detailed neurological evaluation is not routine. We sought to determine if patients with fibromyalgia manifest objective neurological signs of cervical myelopathy.

Two hundred and seventy patients, 18 years and older, who carried the diagnosis of fibromyalgia but had no previously recognized neurological disease, underwent detailed clinical neurological and neuroradiological evaluation for the prevalence of objective evidence of cervical myelopathy and radiological evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation (Chiari 1 malformation) or cervical spinal canal stenosis.

Patients were primarily women (87%), with a mean age of 44 years, who had been symptomatic for 8 years (standard deviation, 6.3 years). The predominant complaints were neck/back pain (95%), fatigue (95%), exertional fatigue (96%), cognitive impairment (92%), instability of gait (85%), grip weakness (83%), paresthesiae (80%), dizziness (71%), and numbness (69%). Eighty-eight percent of patients reported worsening symptoms with neck extension.

The neurological examination was consistent with cervical myelopathy: upper thoracic spinothalamic sensory level (83%), hyperreflexia (64%), inversion of the radial periosteal reflex (57%), positive Romberg sign (28%), ankle clonus (25%), positive Hoffman sign (26%), impaired tandem walk (23%), dysmetria (15%), and dysdiadochokinesia (13%). MRI and contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the cervical spine revealed stenosis.

### Radiographic assessment [^1144nW4p]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, particularly with respect to cervical imaging, radiography, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a 3-view cervical spine X-ray (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) in patients with symptoms of suspected cervical spinal cord injury if CT is unavailable. It is advisable to obtain a follow-up CT, when available, to further define areas that are suspicious or not well visualized on plain cervical X-rays.

### A diagnostic biomarker for cervical myelopathy based on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging [^111E9EDb]. Spine (2023). High credibility.

This multicenter prospective observational study evaluates the use of diffusion tensor imaging in flexion-extension to improve the diagnosis of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). The study aims to provide an imaging biomarker for detecting DCM, which is the most common form of spinal cord dysfunction in adults, though imaging surveillance remains poorly characterized.

Symptomatic DCM patients were examined in maximum neck flexion-extension and neutral positions using a 3T-magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Participants were allocated into two groups: (1) those with visible intramedullary hyperintensity (IHIS+) on T2-weighted imaging (n = 10), and (2) those without IHIS (IHIS-, n = 11). Various parameters such as range of motion, space available for the spinal cord, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were measured and compared between neck positions, groups, and between control (C2/3) and pathologic segments.

- **Results**: Significant differences were observed between the control level (C2/3) and pathologic segments for the IHIS+ group at the neutral neck position in AD, at flexion in ADC and AD, and at neck extension in ADC, AD, and fractional anisotropy values. For the IHIS- group, significant differences between the control level (C2/3) and pathologic segments were identified only for ADC values in neck extension. Comparative analysis of diffusion parameters between groups showed radial diffusivity was significantly different in all three neck positions.

### Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: 2-dimensional operative video [^111jJime]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common cause of progressive quadriparesis in adults. It is characterized by compression of the cervical spinal cord due to degenerative changes, including intervertebral disc protrusion, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation. Clinically, patients can present with declining motor control in the extremities, gait imbalance, spasticity, hyperreflexia, or possibly frank weakness.

Surgical treatment options include ventral and dorsal approaches, whose indications vary depending on spinal alignment, number of levels requiring decompression, the dorsal/ventral/circumferential location of compression, and patient-specific anatomic constraints. Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion is a mainstay of treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy when a dorsal approach is indicated.

In this video, we present a case of a 60-year-old female who presented with signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, with MRI findings of C3 on C4 anterolisthesis and circumferential central stenosis worst at C4–5 and C5–6. We demonstrate the operative steps to complete a C3 to C6 decompression and instrumented fusion with lateral mass screws. Appropriate patient consent was obtained.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^111wa6MA]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

For the future, diagnostic accuracy and prognostic information for affected patients should be improved by combining different MRI modalities. Especially diffusion-based techniques, such as diffusion microstructural imaging (DMI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), may allow conclusions about alterations of the axonal integrity and intramedullary free water distribution. Cerebro-spinal fluid and spinal cord motion, assessed by phase-contrast imaging, or even specific metabolite configurations from magnetic resonance spectroscopy, may provide additional pathodynamic information. We are working on a multimodal MRI assessment, integrating different modalities and correlating the imaging information with symptomatic and electrophysiological data to optimize clinical treatment decisions and outcomes for DCM patients.

This evaluation represents one step for this approach with the implementation of a routinely applicable, fast, and observer-independent assessment of intramedullary T2 signal alterations, transferring this into a quantifiable setting.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112crLZ2]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

The translation of these techniques is most likely to benefit patients with mild forms of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) where there is greater diagnostic uncertainty. For example, fewer patients display the more objective examination findings, such as the Hoffman sign. There is also management uncertainty: are the risks of surgery warranted against the natural history of mild DCM?

In keeping with DCM research in general, relatively few imaging studies have investigated mild myelopathy. Martin et al. used microstructural MRI, particularly T2✱ gray matter/white matter ratio assessment, to identify subclinical evidence of spinal cord damage in a cohort of patients with cervical stenosis, thus confirming its promise. This finding is supported by similar studies using multimodal evoked potentials, suggesting that solutions may also lie outside of imaging.

Whatever the modality, the development of assessments to unlock this conundrum is crucial. Being able to identify who requires surgery and perform it before there is irreversible damage would transform outcomes for DCM, moving it from a paradigm of reactive to pre-emptive care.

### Diagnostic role of flexion-extension central motor conduction time in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^113fEa1o]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Based on our results, we have identified that neck motions — flexion and extension — increase cervical cord compression in terms of neurophysiology. This finding supports previous studies on dynamic MRI, which insist that the spinal canal narrowing worsens during neck flexion. Our discovery is also evidenced by the MRI findings in this study. Furthermore, our finding means that neck movement provokes either temporary or continuous cervical cord compression in CSM patients, and cord impingement due to repeated neck motions causes symptoms to progress and worsen slowly.

Numerous studies have described the mechanisms causing spinal canal stenosis and cord compression due to neck motions. Most space-occupying lesions due to cervical degeneration occur anterior to the cervical cord. Diseases such as disc protrusion, OPLL, vertebral osteophyte, and retrolisthesis can cause an increase in mechanical compression of the spinal canal and the cervical cord during neck flexion. Meanwhile, during neck extension, spinal canal narrowing becomes prominent, and the spinal cord shifts forward. Those changes increase the pressure received by the spinal canal due to the aforementioned anterior cervical lesions. Furthermore, most CSM patients experience thickening of the ligamentum flavum and facet joint hypertrophy, which are other common causes of increasing pressure on the spinal canal and the cervical cord during neck extension. Microvascular injury is yet another mechanism for explaining cord injury caused by repeated neck movement. Cervical cord stretching occurs during neck flexion and cervic…

### Location, length, and enhancement: Systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^115ZeMn3]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Compressive myelopathy is a common cause of weakness and sensory deficits in older patients, often due to cervical compressive myelopathy or myelopathic spondylosis. These conditions can occur secondary to spondylotic changes in the cervical spine and less commonly due to congenital abnormalities. The mechanism involves decreased canal diameter and spinal stenosis, leading to focal signal abnormality within the affected cord (Fig. 23). Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common contributor. Compressive myelopathy typically demonstrates focal T2 hyperintensity in the cord at a level of spinal stenosis (at the level of a disc) with or without associated enhancement.

- **Compressive myelopathy diagnosis**:
	- Fig. 23 shows a 50-year-old patient with bilateral hand tingling.
	- In image (a), a sagittal T2 view reveals severe spinal canal narrowing at C3–C4 due to degenerative changes, with focal faint signal hyperintensity (arrow).
	- In image (b), the post-contrast image indicates focal enhancement (arrow).

- **Miscellaneous lesion summary**:
	- Hirayama disease primarily affects young males and is mostly recognized in Japan and India.
	- It presents with unilateral upper extremity weakness and is associated with a lax dura mater, which changes position during flexion and extension.
	- These changes cause repetitive circulatory issues in the anterior spinal artery due to cord compression, leading to atrophy and eventual necrosis in the anterior horns.
	- MRI plays a crucial role in diagnosing this rare disease (Fig. 24), but neutral cervical spine images are not very sensitive in showing the pertinent changes.

### Prevalence and imaging characteristics of nonmyelopathic and myelopathic spondylotic cervical cord compression [^115mSw5r]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional population-based observational study aims to estimate the prevalence of nonmyelopathic spondylotic cervical cord compression (NMSCCC) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in individuals over 40 years of age and to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of these conditions. The prevalence of NMSCCC and CSM is not well known, and there is no widely accepted quantitative MRI definition of cervical cord compression.

A total of 183 randomly recruited volunteers, comprising 93 women with a median age of 66 years (range 40–80 years), underwent MRI examination of the cervical spine and spinal cord using a 1.5 T device. Conventional sequences from disc levels C2/C3 to C6/C7 were employed. The imaging criterion for cervical cord compression was defined as a change in spinal cord contour at the level of an intervertebral disc on axial or sagittal MRI scans.

MRI signs of cervical cord compression were observed in 108 individuals (59.0%; 95% CI: 51.5%-66.2%), with an increase in prevalence from 31.6% in the fifth decade to 66.8% in the eighth decade. Clinical signs of symptomatic CSM were identified in two cases (1.1%), while 75 cases (41.0%) showed no compression. An anteroposterior cervical canal diameter at the level of the intervertebral disc (CDdisc) of less than 9.9 mm was associated with the highest probability of NMSCCC (odds ratio, OR = 32.5), followed by a compression ratio of ≤ 0.5 (OR = 11.1).

In conclusion, the prevalence of NMSCCC in individuals older than 40 years is higher than previously reported and increases with age.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115kcHih]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

The post-processing procedure includes 3D spinal cord segmentation and generation of the T2-SI curve from C2 to C7 slice-by-slice for a patient with spinal stenosis at the level C5/6 without intramedullary T2 hyperintensities.

To compare the respective cervical segments, the mean, standard deviation (SD), and range of the T2-SI for all slices were calculated from the center of the upper to the center of the lower cervical body, respectively. Representing the extent of T2-SI variability, we introduced the "T2 myelopathy index" (T2-MI) as a new parameter, defined as the percentage of the T2-SI range in relation to the mean absolute T2-SI within each cervical segment.

The complete post-processing, including segmentation, T2-SI curve generation, and calculation of the evaluated parameters, takes about 3 minutes.

The subjective categorization of T2 hyperintensities involves the definition of ground truth, where the presence of a T2 hyperintensity within the spinal cord is subjectively evaluated at each cervical level from C2 to C7, receiving five ratings per MRI scan (levels C2/3, C3/4, C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7). All segments are classified in a binary fashion as "T2-positive" if a hyperintensity occurs or "T2-negative" if it does not. To increase reliability, the categorization was performed by three independent, blinded, experienced observers, each with at least 10 years of experience in spinal MRI evaluation. The agreement among all three observers was evaluated through Fleiss' kappa statistics.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^113n4Ssc]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

The exact position of the T2 signal alteration within the spinal cord and the type of their boundaries was not addressed in our evaluation due to the averaging of every cross-section. However, the sharp or blurry demarcation of T2 hyperintense areas was a relevant prognostic factor in previous subjective classifications, which must be considered a limitation. A reported CNN-based detection of multiple sclerosis lesions and their shape showed sufficient accuracies, which seems to be an option for the detection of myelopathic lesions similarly. Two MRI examinations showed a prominent central canal, which could affect the signal intensity evaluation.

For the required 3D segmentation of the spinal cord, a slice thickness of a maximum of 1 mm is necessary and almost possible in an adequate acquisition time due to enhanced MRI scanner technology. Our whole evaluation procedure takes about 7 minutes, consisting of nearly 4 minutes of acquisition time and about 3 minutes of post-processing, which seems to be implementable in every clinical "all-day" setting. The applied 3D T2 SPACE sequence has the disadvantage of a worse signal-to-noise ratio and image contrast compared to conventional 2D T2-weighted sequences, usually used for subjective categorization of T2 hyperintensities. However, the diagnostic quality is acceptable for the evaluation of intramedullary T2-SI variations, as demonstrated through our results.

The absolute T2-SI values are not interindividually comparable due to known specific imaging conditions for each MRI scan, a fact that could be confirmed by these results, showing no significant difference.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^1126sNtn]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Detection of T2 hyperintensities in suspected degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is done subjectively in clinical practice. To obtain objective quantification for dedicated treatment, signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord is purposeful. We investigated fully automated quantification of the T2 signal intensity (T2-SI) of the spinal cord using a high-resolution MRI segmentation.

A matched-pair analysis was conducted on prospectively acquired cervical 3D T2-weighted sequences from 114 symptomatic patients and 88 healthy volunteers. The cervical spinal cord was segmented automatically using a trained convolutional neural network, followed by subsequent T2-SI registration performed slice-by-slice. The received T2-SI curves were subdivided for each cervical level from C2 to C7. Additionally, all levels were subjectively classified with respect to the presence of T2 hyperintensity. For T2-positive levels, corresponding T2-SI curves were compared to the curves of age-matched volunteers at the identical level.

Forty-nine patients exhibited subjective T2 hyperintensities at any level. The corresponding T2-SI curves demonstrated higher signal variability as reflected by the standard deviation (18.51 vs. 7.47 a.u.; p < 0.001) and range (56.09 vs. 24.34 a.u.; p < 0.001) compared to matched controls. The percentage of the range from the mean absolute T2-SI per cervical level, introduced as the "T2 myelopathy index" (T2-MI), was significantly higher in T2-positive segments (23.99% vs. 10.85%; p < 0.001). ROC analysis indicated excellent differentiation for all three parameters (AUC 0.865–0.920).

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115ieCpK]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Ask patients to report any worsening or new symptoms or signs as untreated levels of the cervical spine might further degenerate and cause spinal cord compression.

- **Education into practice**: What features would prompt you to suspect DCM in a patient? How would you explain a diagnosis of DCM to your patient? Are you aware of the appropriate local pathways for arranging an urgent MRI scan for patients with suspected DCM? After reading this article, are there any aspects of imaging or referral that you would approach differently?

This article was reviewed and endorsed by individuals experiencing DCM who were part of a committee at Myelopathy.org. The committee was keen to emphasize the possible prevalence of DCM and its long-term effects, even after surgery. More specifically, it was involved in shaping the paragraph "What is DCM?"

Myelopathy.org is the first organization dedicated to raising awareness, providing information, and supporting research for DCM. It provides a forum for individuals to communicate their experiences of DCM and offers peer-to-peer support to patients. Reports of delayed and/or misdiagnosis are common, which result from a lack of awareness among frontline medical specialties, particularly primary care. The committee proposed an educational initiative, which included this article.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115rFHkF]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

This fully automated T2 signal quantification of the spinal cord was able to reveal a significantly different variability of the T2-SI in patients with DCM and present T2 hyperintensities compared to healthy volunteers. Whilst the absolute T2-SI values are not applicable due to known individual imaging conditions, we introduced the new, inter-individually comparable T2 myelopathy index (T2-MI), showing corresponding significances to the extent of signal variability represented by the standard deviation and range of T2-SI at every cervical level.

This automated, innovative procedure has the potential for diagnosing radiological DCM more objectively and in a standardized manner, thus optimizing the recommendation for treatment. The determination of more detailed cut-off values associated with the different stages of DCM and its diagnostic accuracy is under further investigation.

### Cervical spinal cord compression attributable to a calcified intervertebral disc in a patient with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets: Case report and review of the literature [^115rL1Js]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is a common inherited phosphate-wasting disorder, but it is a rare cause of spinal cord compression. The article presents the first reported case of a calcified intervertebral disc causing spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 44-year-old woman presented with paresthesia of her left arm and a loss of grip in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a calcified intervertebral disc, as well as a posterior osteophytic bar causing marked cervical cord compression at C6/C7.

- **Intervention**: An anterior cervical discectomy at C6/C7 and fusion with autologous bone graft were performed. The patient then exhibited significant improvement.

- **Conclusion**: A review of the 16 published cases demonstrates that thickening of the vertebral laminae, facet joint hypertrophy, and ossification of the intervertebral discs, posterior longitudinal ligament, and/or ligamentum flavum contribute to spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Those changes are caused by the disease itself and are unlikely to be related to long-term vitamin D treatment. Eleven of 16 patients were reported to have experienced favorable outcomes after surgery.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^115kMZw6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Spondylotic degeneration in the cervical spine may result in static and/or dynamic spinal cord compression, leading to associated signs and symptoms of myelopathy. Clinical examination, combined with appropriate imaging studies, helps confirm the diagnosis. Classic natural history and basic science studies suggest a pernicious course of demyelination and neurologic decline in a large subset of patients. The characterization of disease severity and progression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has improved with recent advances in imaging and data from prospective and multicenter studies.

Additionally, advances in surgical techniques, implants, and imaging modalities have enhanced the identification of surgical candidates with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and associated treatment strategies. Surgical treatment, via an anterior, posterior, or combined approach, primarily aims to arrest neurologic progression, although it can improve function in many patients. Alignment and the characteristics and location of spinal cord compression help determine the ideal surgical approach. Distinct complications associated with each technique may be mitigated by appropriate patient selection and should be discussed preoperatively to ensure informed decision-making.

### Spinal involvement in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio-Brailsford or Morquio A syndrome): Presentation, diagnosis and management [^112YBz5T]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

In MPS IVA, spinal cord compression may occur in the upper cervical, cervicothoracic, and thoracolumbar regions. Aetiological factors include ligamentous thickening resulting from accumulation of GAGs and fibrocartilaginous tissue, cervical instability, cartilaginous and ligamentous hypertrophy at the atlantoaxial joint, thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the sub-axial spine and in the thoracic and lumbar spine, acquired central canal stenosis, disc protrusion, and thoracolumbar kyphosis. A stenotic spinal canal or a combination of stenosis and instability may be predictive of spinal cord compression, although direct measurement by MRI is necessary to confirm compression, judge severity, and identify the presence of cord injury. Spinal stenosis with concomitant loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow on MRI signifies spinal cord compression. If left untreated, compression can lead to cord damage and myelopathy.

Myelomalacia is best depicted by T2-weighted MR obtained in the sagittal and axial planes where an increase in T2 signal, coupled with volume loss in regions of cord compression, is diagnostic of myelomalacia. When T2 hyperintensity is present without atrophy, the differential diagnosis would include edema due to contusion or microvascular injury. These changes may be more apparent following surgical decompression.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112gw8P9]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of spinal cord impairment in adults. DCM is an important, disabling, and unfortunately frequently overlooked condition, estimated to affect as many as one in 50 adults. Despite the prevalence of DCM, awareness of this condition among the public and even among physicians is lacking. Consequently, many patients do not receive a timely diagnosis, with wait times ranging on average from two to five years.

Given the frequent delays in diagnosis and treatment, many individuals are left with lifelong disabilities despite appropriate surgical intervention. AO Spine RECODE DCM (Research Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) was formed as an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM. One of the research priorities is the development of comprehensive diagnostic criteria for DCM to facilitate early diagnosis and timely management. This requires standardized clinical evaluation metrics based on objective and reproducible signs and symptoms, coupled with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches and standardized evaluation methods.

This is particularly relevant to DCM, as MRI findings, such as cord compression, are often incidental and only weakly correlate with disease severity. To stimulate research and awareness, we discuss a proposed diagnostic framework to advance the role of imaging in the diagnosis of DCM.

### Correlation between operative outcomes of cervical compression myelopathy and MRI of the spinal cord [^117NzxcK]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance images of cervical compression myelopathy were retrospectively analyzed in comparison with surgical outcomes. The objective was to investigate which magnetic resonance findings in patients with cervical compression myelopathy reflect the clinical symptoms and prognosis, and to determine the radiographic and clinical factors that correlate with the prognosis.

Signal intensity changes of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging in chronic cervical myelopathy are thought to be indicative of the prognosis. However, the prognostic significance of signal intensity change remains controversial.

The participants in this study were 73 patients who underwent cervical expansive laminoplasty for cervical compression myelopathy. Their mean age was 64 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up period was 3.4 years. The pathologic conditions were cervical spondylotic myelopathy in 42 patients and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in 31 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (spin-echo sequence) was performed in all the patients. The transverse area of the spinal cord at the site of maximal compression was computed, and spinal cord signal intensity changes were evaluated before and after surgery.

Three patterns of spinal cord signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences/T2-weighted sequences were detected as follows: normal/normal, normal/high-signal intensity changes, and low-signal/high-signal intensity changes. Surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSPINE International study on 479 patients [^117Xhdy6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In general, older patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) are believed to have lower recovery potential following surgery due to increased degenerative pathology, comorbidities, reduced physiological reserves, and age-related changes to the spinal cord. This study aims to determine whether age truly is an independent predictor of surgical outcomes and to provide evidence to guide practice and decision-making.

- **Methods**: A total of 479 patients with DCM were prospectively enrolled in the CSM-International study at 16 centers. The sample was divided into a younger group (< 65 years) and an elderly group (≥ 65 years). A mixed model analytic approach was used to evaluate differences in the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), Nurick, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores between groups. An unadjusted model between age and surgical outcome was first created, followed by the development of two adjusted models accounting for variations in (1) baseline characteristics and (2) both baseline and surgical factors.

- **Results**: Of the 479 patients, 360 (75.16%) were < 65 years and 119 (24.84%) were ≥ 65 years. Elderly patients had a worse preoperative health status (p < 0.0001) and were functionally more severe (p < 0.0001). The majority of younger patients (64.96%) underwent anterior surgery, whereas the preferred approach in the elderly group was posterior (58.62%, p < 0.0001). Elderly patients had a greater number of decompressed levels than younger patients (p < 0.0001). At 24 months after surgery, younger patients achieved a higher postoperative mJOA (text missing).

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: A consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy focus issue in Spine collates the existing evidence related to the natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy but with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression.

With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112Dxn95]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

While these new modalities remain in development, there are many simpler gains. For example, discussions within the RECODE DCM working group revealed that the imaging framework could support educational initiatives. Those living with DCM often reference the common misconception that a diagnostic test provides certainty. This framework could help raise awareness among non-expert professionals to identify those with seemingly mild stenosis and symptoms, allowing for timely management, while avoiding unnecessary surgery in patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

Future directions in the neuroimaging evaluation of DCM require a standardized definition of spinal canal narrowing, spinal cord compression, and intrinsic cord signal changes. Systematic literature reviews with consensus-based evidence synthesis could set the stage for developing an objective imaging diagnostic framework for DCM.

Creating a straightforward framework for diagnosis in DCM has the potential to dramatically change care and outcomes. Novel methods for determining spinal cord distress are currently under examination and may reshape our understanding of DCM; however, these methods remain a work in progress. We look forward to the feedback and perspectives of the community and hope more will work with us on this endeavor.

### Hypermetabolism in 18F-FDG PET predicts favorable outcome following decompressive surgery in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111A395B]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the regional changes of glucose metabolism in the cervical spinal cord of patients with degenerative cervical spine stenosis and symptomatic cervical myelopathy after decompressive surgery using (18)F-FDG PET.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with symptomatic degenerative monosegmental cervical stenosis and neuroradiologic signs of spinal cord compression underwent decompressive surgery. The clinical course, using a functional status score (Japanese Orthopedic Association [JOA] score), (18)F-FDG uptake, and MR imaging, was assessed before surgery and at a 12-month follow-up. Pre- and postoperative changes of (18)F-FDG PET were correlated with the patients' clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Ten patients demonstrated preoperatively a focally increased (18)F-FDG uptake at the level of the stenosis. At follow-up, the uptake declined significantly (P = 0.008), and a significant improvement in JOA scores (P < 0.001) was observed. The remaining ten patients were characterized preoperatively by an inconspicuous glucose uptake at the level of cord compression, along with a post-stenotic decrease of (18)F-FDG uptake. At follow-up, both JOA scores and (18)F-FDG uptake changed insignificantly.

- **Conclusion**: Focal glucose hypermetabolism at the level of cervical spinal cord compression may predict an improved outcome after surgical decompression. Thus, this finding on (18)F-FDG PET suggests a functional damage in a reversible phase of cervical myelopathy.

### Diagnostic role of flexion-extension central motor conduction time in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1148XUKi]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) results from progressive compression of the spinal canal and cervical cord due to degenerative changes in the cervical vertebrae, often associated with aging. Representative degenerative conditions of cervical stenosis include intervertebral disc protrusion, spondylolisthesis, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). These conditions provoke symptoms ranging from mild neck pain and radiating pain to spinal cord syndromes such as paresthesia, weakness, clumsy hand, and gait disturbance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized as a diagnostic tool for confirming cord compression. Many patients with CSM exhibit not only static cord compression in a neutral neck position but also dynamic cord compression during neck flexion and extension. Numerous studies describe the diagnosis of compressive cervical myelopathy using both dynamic and static MRI to identify cervical cord impingement.

Electrophysiological studies have been conducted to evaluate not only spinal cord compression but also combined neurologic conditions such as cervical radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathies. Among these electrophysiological evaluations, motor evoked potential (MEP), recorded by transcranial magnetic stimulation, is key for ascertaining whether there is a disturbance of central motor conduction along the corticospinal tract. It has been widely reported that central motor conduction time (CMCT), derived from MEP and motor conduction studies, provides objective and sensitive values for assessing central motor conduction disturbances.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy due to chronic compression: The role of signal intensity changes in magnetic resonance images [^115GZzKb]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Although there is agreement that low-intensity signal changes on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images are a prognostic factor for poor outcome after surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy due to chronic cord compression, the role of high-intensity signal changes on T2-weighted images is still controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine whether T2-weighted MR imaging can help assess the prognosis of the disease.

A prospective case series study was conducted. The population comprised 67 patients who underwent surgery between 1994 and 2004 to treat myelopathy caused by chronic cervical cord compression. The mean follow-up period was 39 months. Preoperative and postoperative functional status was evaluated using a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and the recovery rate was calculated using the Hirabayashi method. Magnetic resonance images were acquired 3 months or less before surgery. High-intensity signal changes were evaluated according to the extent of these changes on T2-weighted sequences; low-intensity T1-weighted signal changes were also evaluated. In patients with low-intensity changes on T1-weighted images and in those with high-intensity changes spanning multiple levels on T2-weighted images, the authors documented a poor functional recovery.

Multisegmental high-intensity change on T2-weighted MR imaging is a more sensitive indicator of outcomes than T1-weighted signal changes because of its higher frequency in patients with advanced myelopathy.

### Do intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI affect surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^117GRWyn]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Some controversy still exists over the optimal treatment time and the surgical approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity (hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL. This study was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Fifty-six patients with cervical myelopathy due to OPLL were enrolled and assigned to either group A (receiving anterior decompression and fusion, n = 27) or group P (receiving posterior laminectomy, n = 29). All patients were followed up for an average of 20.3 months (range: 12–34 months). Clinical outcomes were assessed by the average operative time, blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, improvement rate (IR), and complications.

To determine the relevant statistics, two factorial designs were employed, and the data of all patients were regrouped into group H (with hyperintensity on MRI, n = 31), group L (with hypointensity on MRI, n = 19), and group N (no signal on MRI, n = 25). These groups were further categorized into six subgroups: AH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group A, n = 15), PH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group P, n = 16), AL (with hypointensity on MRI from group A, n = 10), PL (with hypointensity on MRI from group P, n = 9), AN (no signal intensity on MRI from group A, n = 12), and PN (no signal intensity on MRI from group P, n = 13).

### "I am not delusional"! Sensory dysaesthesia secondary to degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111rgMR1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: DCM is defined as symptomatic spinal cord compression secondary to degenerative changes in the cervical spine. It is common, with a prevalence of up to 5% in those over 40, which is expected to rise as populations age. However, most patients never receive a diagnosis, and those that do face long diagnostic delays, often with initial misdiagnosis. This is significant given that surgery is the only currently effective treatment, but it cannot reverse existing damage.

	- Misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay are key problems in DCM. As in this case, patients often consult many times and wait years for an accurate diagnosis. The reasons for this are unclear but likely include a poor awareness of DCM among non-specialist health professionals, subtle non-specific early symptoms, and poor understanding of the most common symptoms and natural history. Substantial diagnostic delays in the context of the progressive nature of DCM are likely key factors behind DCM having patient quality of life scores among the worst of any chronic disease.

- **Sensory dysaesthesia**: Sensory dysaesthesia is defined as abnormal sensation. The involvement of all four limbs in our patient is consistent with a myelopathic aetiology; however, we are unaware of previous reports of such widespread sensory dysaesthesia in DCM. Nonetheless, unusual sensory presentations of other common neurological diseases, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, have been reported.

- **Facial sensory dysaesthesia**: While facial sensory dysaesthesia would be unexpected secondary to spinal pathology, recent studies report structural and functional changes rostral to the compressive lesion in DCM.

### Predictors of surgical outcome in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: Focusing on the quantitative signal intensity [^11773oRw]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The association between intramedullary increased signal intensity (ISI) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and surgical outcome in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the quantitative signal change ratio (SCR) on the surgical outcome for CSM.

The prospective study included 108 consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment for CSM. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery rate were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. A JOA recovery rate of less than 50% was defined as a poor clinical result. The SCR was defined as the signal intensity at the level of ISI or severely compressed cord (in cases with no ISI) divided by the signal intensity at the C7-T1 disc level. Factors assessed included age, sex, body mass index, duration of symptoms, surgical technique, preoperative JOA score, levels of compression, preoperative SCR, preoperative C2–7 angle, and preoperative C2–7 range of motion.

Forty patients (37.0%) had a recovery rate of less than 50%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher preoperative SCR and a longer duration of symptoms were significant risk factors for a poor clinical outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the optimal preoperative SCR cutoff value as a predictor of a poor clinical result was 1.46. The area under the ROC curve of preoperative SCR for predicting a poor surgical outcome was 0.844.

In conclusion, preoperative SCR significantly reflected the surgical outcome in patients with CSM.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^112axQrT]. Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

In clinical routine, the evaluation of intramedullary signal changes is conducted subjectively, predominantly resulting in a binary categorization for T1 hypointensities. As previously mentioned, different types of signal changes on T2-weighted images exist, yet a validated or internationally standardized scoring system is lacking. Additionally, there is consensus regarding the rater-dependency of such subjective classifications. For T2 hyperintensities, prior evaluations have shown statistically substantial reliabilities for multiple observers, with kappa values ranging from 0.60 to 0.82 for binary classifications and intra-class correlation coefficients between 0.75 and 0.87 for ordinal scores. However, because treatment decisions are based on these classifications, the presence of incongruent ratings holds clinical significance.

There are only a few objective evaluations of spinal cord signal intensity, usually measured through manually placed regions of interest. These evaluations predominantly confirm an inferior prognosis for increased T2 signaling in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Therefore, a more precise and completely objective assessment of intramedullary signal alterations seems beneficial for optimal treatment planning in affected patients. We investigated a fully automated quantification of T2 signal intensity (T2-SI) of the entire cervical spinal cord, based on high-resolution T2 MRI segmentation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of degenerative cervical myelopathy: A review of structural changes and measurement techniques [^112GhXG5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a spectrum of age-related structural changes of the cervical spine that result in static and dynamic injury to the spinal cord and collectively represent the most common cause of myelopathy in adults. Although cervical myelopathy is determined clinically, the diagnosis requires confirmation via imaging, and MRI is the preferred modality. Because of the heterogeneity of the condition and evolution of MRI technology, multiple techniques have been developed over the years in an attempt to quantify the degree of baseline severity and potential for neurological recovery.

- **Techniques and categorization**: In this review, these techniques are categorized anatomically into those that focus on bone, ligaments, discs, and the spinal cord. Measurements for the cervical spine canal size and sagittal alignment are also described briefly. These tools have collectively resulted in the identification of numerous useful parameters.

- **Challenges and emerging techniques**: However, the development of multiple techniques for assessing the same feature, such as cord compression, has also resulted in a number of challenges, including introducing ambiguity in terms of which methods to use and hindering effective comparisons of analysis in the literature. In addition, newer techniques that use advanced MRI are emerging and providing exciting new tools for assessing the spinal cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: A multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^113Cuewd]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of nontraumatic spinal cord injury in adults, with a rising incidence among the global aging population. DCM-induced disability can manifest differently in individuals, spanning a spectrum from mild pain and minor hand numbness to severe cases of incomplete tetraplegia. These severe cases can result in long-lasting impairments of upper extremity function, gait difficulties, and bladder dysfunction. DCM is characterized by chronic spinal cord compression, leading to neural tissue destruction at the site of compression, but also includes remote changes of the spinal cord and can even affect the brain. The standard of care for moderate to severe DCM is surgical decompression. Nevertheless, for mildly affected DCM patients, the ideal timing for surgical intervention remains uncertain. Additionally, even after anatomically successful surgery, some DCM patients may still experience progressive disability.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) techniques have the potential to offer biomarkers that are sensitive to pathophysiological changes with clinical significance. Consequently, these techniques hold promise for enhancing the prediction of recovery in patients with DCM and assisting with clinical decision-making. The robustness and reproducibility of qMRI methods across multiple clinical sites are crucial prerequisites for the development of such biomarkers. Furthermore, there is a growing need to enhance statistical power to improve the efficiency of clinical trials.

### Clinical and radiological correlates of severity and surgery-related outcome in cervical spondylosis [^112FTZYK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine if radiological features could be used to predict outcomes in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

The authors studied 69 patients who were consecutively referred to The National Hospital, Queen Square, for decompressive surgery. Data obtained from preoperative cervical spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were analyzed on two separate occasions by two blinded radiologists. The parameters determined were signal change and the presence and severity of compression. Clinical outcomes were determined by pre- and postoperative timed walks, as well as by evaluation of myelopathy disability index scores, Ranawat classification, and Nurick grades. There was good inter- and intraobserver reliability for determination of radiological data.

A significant relationship was found between MR imaging signal change and surgery-related outcomes, as reflected by improvement in walking parameters. However, this was confounded by the fact that signal change also related to preoperative walking parameters. Patients for whom preoperative walking function was worse experienced greater functional improvement in walking postoperatively. The relationships between ambulatory-related data and severity or extent of spinal cord compression were less marked.

Cervical cord compression and intrinsic MR imaging signal change correlate with clinical severity. In this population, the presence of signal change was correlated with better surgery-related outcomes. However, confounding factors and the lack of stro

### State of the art in degenerative cervical myelopathy: An update on current clinical evidence [^116xa8nx]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common cause of spinal cord dysfunction that clinicians encounter daily. Research over the past few decades has provided improved insight into the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder. We aim to update clinicians regarding the state of the art in DCM, focusing on more recent research on pathophysiology, natural history, treatment, consideration of the minimally symptomatic patient, surgical outcome prediction, and outcome measurement.

Concepts of pathophysiology emphasize the combination of static and dynamic elements leading to a breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier at the site of compression, resulting in local inflammation, cellular dysfunction, and apoptosis.

In terms of treatment, although there is a dearth of high-quality studies comparing surgical to non-operative treatment, several large prospective studies have recently associated surgical management with clinically and statistically significant improvements in functional, disability, and quality of life outcomes at long-term follow-up.

When selecting the specific surgical intervention for a patient with DCM, anterior (discectomy, corpectomy, hybrid discectomy/corpectomy), posterior (laminectomy and fusion, laminoplasty), and combined approaches may be considered as options depending on the patient's specifics; evidence supporting each of these approaches is reviewed in detail. Recently developed clinical prediction models allow accurate forecasting of postoperative outcomes.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^114LHtBo]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

This study employs a matched-cohort analysis comparing patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) to healthy volunteers from two separate trials. Participants underwent identical cervical MRI protocols conducted prospectively between July 2018 and January 2022. Inclusion criteria for patients involved those from the local outpatient clinic exhibiting cervical spinal canal compromise with at least radiological contact of degenerative tissue to the spinal cord, combined with symptoms of degenerative cervical spine disease. Healthy volunteers were recruited through a clinical announcement. Specifics on inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously published. Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained for both trials (reference numbers 261/17 and 338/17), and the study was registered at the National Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00012962 and DRKS00017351). All participants provided signed informed written consent before their inclusion.

### Increased flow signal in compressed segments of the spinal cord in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^114mh9aH]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

In a prospective controlled trial, researchers aim to describe a newly discovered increased flow signal in phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, observed in the compressed segments of the spinal cord in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). The derangement of cerebrospinal fluid movement in the spine is a well-known cause of syringomyelia. However, its role in CSM has not been well studied, despite similar derangements occurring in CSM.

In a consecutive series of 57 patients with CSM, cardiac-gated phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed. The amplitude of the flow signal obtained in the compressed segment of the spinal cord was compared with that obtained in the lesion-free C2 segment, as well as with controls from 10 healthy volunteers. Additionally, the study examined whether the amplitude correlated with the severity of cervical canal stenosis, neurological symptoms, surgical indications, and the presence of intramedullary high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images. In 33 patients who underwent decompression surgical procedures, the amplitude of the flow signal was compared between preoperative and postoperative states.

Results indicated an increased flow signal on phase-contrast studies in compressed segments of the spinal cord in 36 (63%) patients. The mean amplitude of the signal in the compressed segment was 0.64 ± 0.06 cm/s, while in the C2 segment, it was 0.27 ± 0.01, and in controls, it was 0.28 ± 0.01. The flow signal linearly increased as the severity of can

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: Results of the AOSPINE North America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (i.e. cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (e.g. ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (HLF)). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 years old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these individuals become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 years or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM largely stems from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a significant number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt the progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming the standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptoms.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112H5FTc]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

In degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), cervical spine imaging, particularly MRI, is essential for diagnosis as spinal canal narrowing is a prerequisite for spinal cord compression. However, given the high prevalence of patients with asymptomatic spinal canal stenosis, the strong interrelation of degenerative features, and the challenges of correlating clinical and radiological findings, we advocate that spinal canal narrowing alone does not suffice for diagnosing DCM. An accurate diagnostic approach will need to define other characteristics, such as signs and symptoms, that permit a final diagnosis when cervical canal narrowing is present on MRI. In addition, differential diagnoses, for example, multiple sclerosis and tumors, should be ruled out with MRI.

### The changes in systemic monocytes in humans undergoing surgical decompression for degenerative cervical myelopathy may influence clinical neurological recovery [^111hCk4R]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2019). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury worldwide. Surgical decompression is recommended as the preferred treatment strategy for DCM as it halts disease progression and improves neurologic symptoms. We previously demonstrated that neuroinflammation, including monocytes, plays a critical role in the pathobiology of DCM and in ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) following surgical decompression. Monocytes are able to enter the spinal cord and brain tissues due to damage to the blood spinal cord and blood-brain barrier following injury. Studies have demonstrated that stroke patients and individuals undergoing hip replacement surgery have increased systemic levels of monocytes. Additionally, changes in the signaling responses of monocytes are associated with post-surgical recovery or with ischemic neural tissue damage. Herein, we investigated the role of systemic monocytes as a predictive biomarker for clinical recovery following decompressive surgery for DCM.

- **Findings**: There was a two-fold increase in the number of monocytes in DCM patients at 24 hours following decompression compared to baseline levels, which was associated with a significant improvement in the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (mJOA) at 6 months after surgery (p < .0001). In a mouse model of DCM, depleting acute monocytes reduced the non-classical (Ly6C low) subset from circulation (p < .05) and resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in CD11b expression in the spinal cord at 5 weeks following decompression.

### The relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Analysis of a global cohort [^112zAvmu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

The study design is a retrospective analysis of prospective data. The objective is to assess the relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Several studies have sought to assess the extent of spinal cord dysfunction and the potential for postoperative neurological recovery through the evaluation of spinal cord signal change on T2-weighted (T2WI) and T1-weighted images (T1WI). There remains ambiguity if T2WI and T1WI signal changes relate to baseline severity and predict neurological recovery after surgical treatment.

Methods involved examining 419 MRIs from two prospective multicenter studies. Images were assessed for the presence, levels, and location of spinal cord signal intensity changes and compared with clinical data. Signal changes were also evaluated for the prediction of two-year postoperative outcomes using mJOA parameters.

Results indicated that MRIs were categorized by T1WI and T2WI signal change as follows: no signal change (28.9%), T2WI hyperintensity-only (T2WI-only, 51.8%), and T2WI-hyperintensity and T1WI-hypointensity (T1WI+T2WI, 19.3%). T2WI-hyperintensity was present at multiple levels in 27% of patients overall. Baseline severity increased from no signal change to T2WI-only to T2WI+T1WI (P < 0.0001), with an incremental increase in the frequency of signs and symptoms. There were no differences in outcomes between no signal change and T2WI-only groups. The presence of T1WI-hypointensity correlated with a reduced recovery ratio (P = 0.03).
