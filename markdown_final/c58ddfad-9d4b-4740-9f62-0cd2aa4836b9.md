## Question

elevated TSH and normal T4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing an elevated TSH with normal free T4, i.e., subclinical hypothyroidism, including when to treat, when to observe, and how to monitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and excluding assay or physiologic confounders. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis, especially distinguishing primary from central causes. Next, I will assess progression risk using antibodies and TSH magnitude. After that, I need to weigh treatment benefits versus harms by TSH strata and patient factors. Finally, I will outline concrete management pathways, special populations, and a practical monitoring plan, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical definition and the need to verify persistence before labeling subclinical hypothyroidism, because a single elevated TSH with normal free T4 is insufficient for diagnosis and could reflect transient fluctuation or assay variability. I should repeat TSH and free T4 in 2–3 months to confirm persistence and avoid premature treatment decisions [^11777Vu1] [^116W6nFP].

> Wait, let me verify potential confounders that can mimic or blunt TSH signals before I anchor on primary thyroid disease. Recent illness, medications like amiodarone or glucocorticoids, biotin supplementation, heterophile antibodies, and nonthyroidal illness can distort TSH and thyroid hormone assays, so I need to check history, medications, and consider repeating testing on a different platform or using alternative methods if results are discordant with the clinical picture [^113XpJMe] [^114fiaqB] [^112jhSYv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should confirm whether this is primary subclinical hypothyroidism versus central hypothyroidism or assay interference, because central causes show low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4, whereas here TSH is elevated and free T4 is normal, which fits primary subclinical hypothyroidism, most commonly due to autoimmune thyroiditis, so I will now examine thyroid peroxidase antibodies to stratify progression risk and etiologic likelihood [^11777Vu1] [^115QehcY].

> I need to check the magnitude of TSH elevation and antibody status to gauge progression risk. TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L represents mild disease with about 2–3% annual progression to overt hypothyroidism, whereas TSH greater than 10 mIU/L carries higher progression risk, and positive TPO antibodies further increase progression, so I should document both to guide counseling and follow-up intensity [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

> Let me consider the evidence on treatment benefits and harms before recommending therapy. High-quality randomized trials show no clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life or symptoms with levothyroxine in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, and there is a risk of iatrogenic overtreatment, particularly in older adults, so I should be cautious and individualize decisions rather than reflexively treat [^114LBMH9] [^1151QfPg].

> I should double-check the TSH thresholds that trigger treatment discussions. Guidelines converge on treating when TSH is persistently above 10 mIU/L, and for TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, treatment may be reasonable in selected patients with symptoms, positive TPO antibodies, or cardiovascular risk, but I must acknowledge that evidence for benefit is limited and shared decision-making is essential [^114LBMH9] [^1168sTdk] [^116Sn7Cd].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy? I need to ensure a lower treatment threshold because even mild TSH elevation can have maternal–fetal implications, so in women who are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or undergoing assisted reproduction, treatment to achieve trimester-specific targets, often TSH less than 2.5 mIU/L, is recommended despite the general adult guidance to avoid overtreatment [^111RdcN1] [^116y3PNk].

> Let me think about older adults specifically. TSH distribution shifts upward with age, and many older adults with mildly elevated TSH normalize spontaneously within a year, so I should confirm persistence with at least two measurements and consider a higher diagnostic threshold or a watchful waiting approach to avoid unnecessary lifelong therapy and overtreatment harms [^116W6nFP] [^113kszhz].

> I will now examine the monitoring strategy if I choose observation. Repeating TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months is reasonable, with closer intervals if TSH is rising or antibodies are positive, and I should educate the patient about symptoms of overt hypothyroidism to prompt earlier reassessment if they emerge [^notfound].

> If I decide to treat, I should confirm the dosing and monitoring approach. Levothyroxine is first-line, typically started at 25–50 mcg daily in otherwise healthy adults, with dose adjustments based on free T4 rather than TSH in the early phase because TSH can lag, aiming for a free T4 in the upper half of normal while watching for atrial arrhythmias or bone loss, especially in older adults [^116uLLpr] [^113mkwj1].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts. In children and adolescents, most cases are transient and observation is preferred unless there are risk factors or progression, in nonthyroidal illness TSH abnormalities often reverse and should not be overinterpreted, and in central hypothyroidism TSH is unreliable so free T4 must guide diagnosis and therapy, which means I need to tailor my approach to the underlying condition and avoid reflex TSH-only algorithms in these settings [^111brCgr] [^115QehcY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "never treat" when TSH is below 10 mIU/L, but I should correct that. While the BMJ guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine levothyroxine for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, it explicitly carves out exceptions such as pregnancy, severe symptoms, or very high TSH, and professional society guidance still supports individualized treatment in selected patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L who have symptoms, positive antibodies, or cardiovascular risk, so I need to ensure shared decision-making rather than a blanket prohibition [^114LBMH9] [^1168sTdk] [^116Sn7Cd].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm persistence with repeat TSH and free T4, exclude confounders, assess TSH magnitude and TPO antibodies, stratify by patient factors such as age, pregnancy status, symptoms, and cardiovascular risk, treat if TSH is persistently above 10 mIU/L or if there are compelling indications despite lower TSH, observe with periodic monitoring if mild and low risk, and adjust levothyroxone to free T4 when treating, documenting the rationale and patient preferences at each step [^11777Vu1] [^114LBMH9] [^112GQShE].

Elevated TSH with normal T4 is **subclinical hypothyroidism** [^11777Vu1], most often due to autoimmune thyroiditis [^1151QfPg]. Confirm with **repeat TSH and free T4** in 3–6 months [^116XK1nC], check TPOAb, and assess symptoms and cardiovascular risk [^1168sTdk]. Treat if TSH is persistently > 10 mIU/L [^1151QfPg], if TPOAb is positive, or if symptoms are present; otherwise, monitor annually. Levothyroxine is first-line therapy [^113mkwj1]; start low and titrate to normalize TSH, with closer monitoring in older adults or those with comorbidities [^113mkwj1].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a **persistently elevated TSH with normal free T4 and T3** [^11777Vu1]. It is a biochemical diagnosis, typically detected on routine screening [^117PVhnp]. The **prevalence** is up to 10% in adults, increases with age, and is more common in women and in the presence of thyroid autoimmunity [^1151QfPg].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

The **most common cause** is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) [^113mkwj1], characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and progressive hypofunction. Other causes include iodine deficiency, medications (e.g. amiodarone, lithium), and transient thyroiditis [^113XpJMe].

---

## Clinical significance and progression

- **Progression**: About 2–5% per year progress to overt hypothyroidism, especially with positive TPOAb or higher TSH [^11777Vu1].
- **Symptoms**: Often mild or nonspecific (fatigue, weight gain, depression, cognitive impairment) [^1151QfPg].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Associated with dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and heart failure, particularly in younger adults [^11777Vu1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months [^116XK1nC].
- **Autoimmunity**: Measure TPOAb to assess progression risk [^1151QfPg].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound if goiter or nodules are present.
- **Exclude assay interference**: Consider heterophile antibodies or biotin interference if results are discordant [^114fiaqB].

---

## Management strategies

### Observation and monitoring

Observation is appropriate for **TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L** without symptoms or cardiovascular risk, with **monitoring** of TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months [^111yYVBa].

---

### Pharmacological treatment

- **Indications**: TSH > 10 mIU/L, positive TPOAb, symptoms, or cardiovascular risk factors [^1168sTdk].
- **First-line therapy**: Levothyroxine [^113mkwj1]; start low (25–50 mcg/day) and titrate to normalize TSH [^113mkwj1].
- **Monitoring**: TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^notfound].
- **Special populations**: Use lower starting doses in older adults or those with comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Controversies include the **TSH upper limit**, with debate over whether it should be lowered to 2.5 mIU/L [^113kszhz] [^112t6NpZ], and the **treatment threshold**, given limited evidence of benefit in mild cases, especially in older adults [^114LBMH9] [^116W6nFP]. Potential **overdiagnosis** may occur due to age-related TSH shifts and assay variability [^114bqgrE].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, asymptomatic | Observe, repeat TSH in 6–12 months [^notfound] |
| TSH > 10 mIU/L or positive TPOAb | Initiate levothyroxine therapy [^1151QfPg] |
| Symptomatic patients | Consider levothyroxine therapy [^1168sTdk] |
| Elderly patients | - Lower starting dose <br/> - Close monitoring [^notfound] |
| Pregnancy or planning pregnancy | Treat to achieve TSH < 2.5 mIU/L [^116y3PNk] |

---

Elevated TSH with normal T4 reflects subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. Management should be **individualized**, balancing progression risk, symptoms, and patient factors, with observation for low-risk patients and levothyroxine for those at higher risk or with symptoms [^1151QfPg].

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^116JxCS5]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

Suppressed TSH in the first trimester — initial evaluation: During normal early pregnancy, serum TSH may fall due to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation, with a peak hCG "between 7 and 11 weeks gestation". A "serum TSH below 0.1 mU/L… may be present in approximately 5% of women by week 11 of pregnancy". An "abnormal serum TSH value should be evaluated in conjunction with serum TT4 (total T4) (or FT4 [free T4]) and T3 values".

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^116uLLpr]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^117E4w72]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116e2Ezy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^112UcR3F]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Is an isolated TSH elevation in chronic nonthyroidal illness "subclinical hypothyroidism"? [^111brCgr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Elevated TSH with normal T4 frequently occurs with chronic kidney, liver, and heart diseases. Whether isolated TSH elevations represent mild thyroid gland failure has not been established.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for longitudinal studies in chronic heart, liver, or kidney disease documenting persistent isolated TSH elevations or progression to overt hypothyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

Four articles met inclusion criteria. In 16 end-stage renal failure patients, four had isolated TSH elevations. All normalized within 14 months. In 452 systolic heart failure patients, 20 had isolated TSH elevations, five of 20 were persistent, and none progressed to overt hypothyroidism within 6 months. In 207 untreated chronic hepatitis C patients, 12 had isolated TSH elevations and four had increased TSH with reduced free T4; all were female, and 14 had positive antithyroid antibodies. After 1 year, two of 12 developed "clinical hypothyroidism". In 72 chronic hepatitis C patients, nine females had positive antithyroid antibodies. Two antibody-negative patients had TSH 5–6 mU/L with reduced free T4. After 1 year, three of four with positive antithyroid antibodies and baseline TSH < 4 mU/L had elevated TSH with reduced free T4.

Conclusions

In chronically ill patients, there is inadequate evidence to determine: 1) that isolated TSH elevations usually persist or progress to overt hypothyroidism; 2) the etiology and clinical significance of isolated TSH elevations; and 3) whether levothyroxine therapy is indicated for persistent isolated TSH elevations. Thus, isolated TSH elevations in chronic renal, cardiac, or liver diseases have not been documented to indicate mild thyroid gland failure.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^117W8kM1]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect insufficient thyroid replacement in patients with CeH when serum free T4 concentrations are below or close to the LLN, particularly when associated with serum TSH > 1.0 mU/L and multiple and persistent hypothyroid manifestations.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood [^111qrnmf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with a normal total or free thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). It is frequently encountered in both neonatology and general paediatric practice; however, its clinical significance is widely debated. Currently there is no broad consensus on the investigation and treatment of these patients; specifically who to treat and what cut-off level of TSH should be used. This paper reviews the available evidence regarding investigation, treatments and outcomes reported for childhood SH.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

Conclusions

This update of the consensus guidelines on CH recommends worldwide neonatal screening and appropriate diagnostics — including genetics — to assess the cause of both primary and central hypothyroidism. The expert panel recommends the immediate start of correctly dosed LT4 treatment, and frequent follow-up including laboratory testing and dose adjustments to keep TH levels in their target ranges, timely assessments of the need to continue treatment, attention for neurodevelopmental and neurosensory functions and, if necessary, consulting other health professionals, and education of the child and family about CH. Harmonization of diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up will optimize patient outcomes. Lastly, all individuals with CH are entitled to a well-planned transition of care from pediatrics to adult medicine. This consensus guidelines update should be used to further optimize detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of children with all forms of CH in the light of the most recent evidence. It should be helpful in convincing health authorities of the benefits of neonatal screening for CH. Despite ∼50 years of neonatal screening for CH, some important questions remain, such as the genetic etiology of TD, the assumed harm of subclinical CH, that is, a normal fT4 in combination with an elevated TSH, and the cause of the gradually increased incidence of CH with GIS. Further epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to understand the increased incidence of this condition.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Incidence and determinants of spontaneous normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults [^116W6nFP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we have demonstrated that in a large proportion of older adults with mild subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH levels spontaneously normalized in a median follow-up of 1 year, even after 2 consecutive measurements (≥ 3 months apart) of elevated TSH levels. These results have clinical relevance. Current guidelines recommend that a single measurement of elevated serum TSH, with fT4 within reference range, should be confirmed by a repeat measurement of both serum TSH and fT4, along with thyroid peroxidase antibodies, after a 2- to 3-month interval. However, international guidelines differ in their recommendations on the TSH threshold at which treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism should be considered in older adults. Once levothyroxine treatment is initiated, it is often continued lifelong. Based on the observation that with age, the TSH distribution shifts toward a higher level, it has been proposed to extend the upper limit of the TSH reference to 7 mU/L for people aged 80 years or older. Although increasing the upper reference limit will likely reduce unnecessary levothyroxine prescribing for older people, instead of a binary approach, our results support applying more continuous age-related reference ranges, which may be modified by other factors such as sex and season. Moreover, based on the high incidence of spontaneous normalization of TSH levels in a large proportion of older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (also after confirmation by repeat measurement), a third measurement may be recommended before considering initiation of treatment. Based on such an approach, the frequency of the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism can likely be reduced in older adults. This could potentially contribute to a reduction in health care costs, treatment burden, and risk of overtreatment. These results may also have implications for follow-up studies. Levothyroxine is among the most frequently prescribed drugs. Although general practitioner prescription practices vary widely between countries, many older adults have initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a mildly elevated TSH. Moreover, in clinical practice, treatment has often been started after a single measurement of TSH. A recent meta-analysis indicated that deprescribing levothyroxine could be successful for carefully selected patients, although the quality of available evidence was considered low. This underscores the need for future high-quality studies to assess the effects of safely withholding levothyroxine treatment in older adults who initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a diagnosis of mild subclinical hypothyroidism on relevant patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Kumyp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### How should we manage patients with mildly increased serum thyrotrophin concentrations? [^113VUdm6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

A mildly increased serum thyrotrophin (TSH) is usually because of mild thyroid failure, and the most common aetiology in iodine-replete communities is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. It is more common in women, and the prevalence increases with age in both men and women and is associated with the presence of antithyroid antibodies. The majority will have serum TSH levels between 5–10 mIU/l, normal free thyroxine (T4) levels and relatively few symptoms. In 2004, US evidence-based consensus guidelines concluded that there were no adverse outcomes of a mildly increased serum TSH other than a risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and few data to justify levothyroxine therapy. There is still debate as to what constitutes an increased serum TSH, particularly in older subjects. Although some subjects will progress to overt hypothyroidism, recent data suggest a significant proportion revert to a serum TSH within the reference range without treatment. Two recent meta-analyses have suggested that the possible cardiovascular risks may be more significant in younger adults. Other data suggest that mild thyroid failure may be the only reversible cause of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. No appropriately powered prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded interventional trial of levothyroxine therapy for a mildly increased serum TSH exists. However, treatment in subjects who are symptomatic, pregnant or preconception, aged less than 65 years and older subjects with evidence of heart failure appear justified.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115jXbXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- Definition: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- Pathophysiology: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- Epidemiology: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- Disease course: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) in subclinical hypothyroidism — treatment target and threshold: Subclinically hypothyroid women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) should be treated with LT4, and the goal of treatment is to achieve a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration < 2.5 mU/L; it therefore seems prudent to recommend treatment of subclinically hypothyroid women seeking pregnancy with ART for any TSH elevation > 2.5 mU/L. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Clinical thyrotropin (TSH) measurement — Serum TSH measurement is the best test to screen for primary hypothyroidism in all age groups, but TSH measurement alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis or treatment of patients with central hypothyroidism. In acute and/or intercurrent illness, interpretation is not straightforward and should take into account other patient factors, and age, sex, reproductive status, medications, ethnicity, iodine intake, and biological variation, but not circadian or circannual rhythms, are important variables to consider when interpreting TSH values.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115izZ2e]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1131GDkM]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism — diagnostic considerations are as follows: In the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance, a normal serum TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely, and "euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia" denotes elevated total serum T4 (often total T3) without hyperthyroidism due to thyroid hormone–binding protein disorders including elevations in TBG or transthyretin, abnormal albumin with high-capacity T4 binding (familial hyperthyroxinemic dysalbuminemia), abnormal TTR, and rarely immunoglobulins binding T4 or T3; TBG excess may be hereditary X‑linked or acquired with pregnancy, estrogen administration, hepatitis, acute intermittent porphyria, or drugs (5‑fluorouracil, perphenazine, some narcotics), and other causes include drugs that inhibit T4→T3 conversion (amiodarone or high‑dose propranolol), acute psychosis, extreme high altitude, amphetamine abuse; spurious free T4 elevations may occur with heparin therapy; when free thyroid hormone concentrations are elevated with normal or elevated TSH, further evaluation is necessary and, after excluding euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, TSH‑mediated hyperthyroidism should be considered, with a pituitary lesion on MRI and disproportionately high alpha‑subunit supporting a TSH‑producing pituitary adenoma, while family history and positive genetic testing for T3 receptor mutations support thyroid hormone resistance; heterophilic antibodies can cause spuriously high TSH values.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense? [^111sz82J]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs; in other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results; uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

fT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially AF (risk increased up to 9 × across the normal reference range (30)), with levels of fT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases appears to be, at least in the heart, proportional to circulating fT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in the circumstances of multisystem entities such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible too that additional analyses might find that TSH levels are providing an additional signal to fT4 levels, in some populations for some conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects rather than via the reflection of thyroid status might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, thus far, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone and particularly fT4 levels, rather than TSH levels, with clinical features has been noted by many authors, covering many individual parameters. In particular, the meta-analysis regarding AF noted the association with fT4 but not with TSH. Authors also previously found evidence of associations of clinical parameters with fT4 in the absence of an association with subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently diagnosed. One of these studies also showed associations with TSH.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

American Thyroid Association — diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (Recommendation 78) states that diagnosis should be made using serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values with either total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) using adjusted reference ranges or free T4 and total T3 with trimester-specific normal reference ranges; this is a Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. If trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, consideration should be given to utilizing total T4 and T3 levels and multiply the nonpregnancy reference range by 1.5 after week 16.

Method of thyroid re-evaluation — For a precise diagnosis, L‑T4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period with re‑evaluation at the end including biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed; alternatively, L‑T4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks, and if TSH increases to ≥ 10 mU/l continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed, whereas if thyroid function remains normal the dose may be reduced further followed by retesting. By the age of 2 to 3 years, severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or high TSH levels despite treatment in cases of imperfect compliance.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116HLXFb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113skzpS]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Thyroid dysfunction screening — test interpretation and confirmation in asymptomatic adults indicates that accurate interpretation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is further complicated by measurement variability and conditions other than thyroid disease, and many professional groups recommend repeating thyroid function tests for confirmation of persistent dysfunction over 3- to 6-month intervals in asymptomatic persons before diagnosis or treatment unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.
