## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in cardiovascular risk assessment, including when to order it, how to interpret it, and how to act on it in both primary and secondary prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biology and assay distinctions. Then, I should verify the strength of epidemiologic associations and causality. Next, I will review guideline positions and risk-enhancer thresholds. After that, I need to check the magnitude of incremental predictive value and reclassification. Then, I will examine trial evidence that translates hs-CRP into outcomes, especially JUPITER and its subgroups. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, including when to measure, how to interpret, and what to do with elevated results, while noting limitations and controversies.

> Let me first confirm the biology and assay issues. CRP is a hepatically synthesized acute-phase reactant induced by IL-6; hs-CRP assays detect low-grade inflammation in the 0.1–10 mg/L range, whereas conventional CRP is used for acute infection/inflammation and is not sensitive enough for cardiovascular risk stratification, so I need to ensure I'm ordering the right test in the right context [^41b1b9ea] [^18a945fe]. Wait, let me verify the regulatory language: FDA materials distinguish hs-CRP and "cardiac CRP" assays by performance characteristics and intended use, reinforcing that hs-CRP is the appropriate modality for CVD risk assessment rather than standard CRP [^12cf7f34].

> Next, I should review the strength of association and whether it reflects causality. Large prospective cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show that higher hs-CRP associates with increased risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and vascular mortality, with risk ratios around 1.3–1.6 after adjustment for traditional risk factors, supporting its role as an independent risk marker [^aed73218] [^420a69c2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; Mendelian randomization analyses using CRP gene variants do not support a causal role for CRP in coronary heart disease, suggesting CRP is a marker rather than a mediator, though this does not negate its clinical utility for risk prediction [^c1a4521c] [^b6879812].

> I will now examine guideline positions to anchor practice. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline advises that if, after quantitative risk assessment, treatment decisions remain uncertain, hs-CRP can be considered among optional markers to inform therapy, reflecting a Class IIb, Level B recommendation and aligning with the concept of risk enhancers [^a61e874a] [^5671a26a]. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend routine hs-CRP testing for all asymptomatic adults, citing small incremental benefit and uncertain outcome impact, so I should be selective rather than universal in ordering it [^e082212e] [^7d779a83]. But wait, what if newer guidance shifts this? The 2025 ACC scientific statement recommends obtaining a single hs-CRP measurement in routine practice to identify inflammatory risk, which is a notable evolution toward more routine use in primary prevention, so I need to contextualize this with evolving evidence and local practice patterns [^d0bd0b3c].

> Let me consider the magnitude of incremental predictive value and reclassification. Adding hs-CRP to traditional risk models yields modest improvements in discrimination (C-index increases ~0.003–0.005) and small net reclassification improvements (~1.5–2%), which means the clinical impact is greatest when baseline risk is intermediate and the treatment decision is borderline [^5ef3bcc7] [^28bcba8f]. I should double-check that this aligns with earlier guidance: yes, ACC/AHA explicitly notes that hs-CRP can be considered when risk-based treatment decisions are uncertain, which operationalizes its use as a tiebreaker rather than a screening tool for everyone [^a61e874a].

> Now, I need to translate this into trial-level outcomes. The JUPITER trial randomized 17,802 primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L to rosuvastatin 20 mg vs placebo and showed a 44% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events, with an NNT around 25 over 5 years, establishing that hs-CRP can identify a high-benefit subgroup for statin therapy even when LDL-C is "normal" [^dc8809c8] [^a97d1821]. Hold on, I should verify subgroup applicability: in the 5–10% and 10–20% 10-year risk strata, similar relative risk reductions were observed, supporting use in intermediate-risk patients with elevated hs-CRP, which is precisely where traditional risk models often under-treat [^03dbea97].

> Let me synthesize when to measure hs-CRP. I should order hs-CRP when the patient is asymptomatic, not acutely ill, and when the 10-year ASCVD risk is borderline or intermediate and the treatment decision is uncertain, or when I suspect residual inflammatory risk on therapy; I should avoid measuring during acute illness or in patients with obvious high risk where treatment is already indicated, as results may be confounded and won't change management [^a61e874a] [^d0bd0b3c]. Wait, I should confirm the threshold for "elevated": most guidance uses ≥ 2 mg/L as the risk-enhancing threshold, with ≥ 3 mg/L historically denoting high risk, so I will interpret values in those bands while considering repeat testing if the first result is borderline or unexpected [^e329dcad] [^5e614f39].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results. Values < 1 mg/L are low risk, 1–3 mg/L intermediate, and > 3 mg/L high risk; however, I need to check for confounders such as obesity, smoking, arthritis, or acute illness, and if hs-CRP is > 10 mg/L, I should reconsider whether an acute inflammatory process is present rather than attributing it to chronic cardiovascular risk [^5e614f39] [^953fcd3f]. Hold on, I should verify the recommendation to repeat: yes, if the initial value is elevated and the patient is otherwise well, repeating in 2–3 weeks and averaging improves reliability given biological and analytical variability [^18a945fe].

> I will now examine what to do with elevated hs-CRP. In primary prevention, an hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L in a borderline or intermediate-risk patient supports intensifying lifestyle therapy and considering statin therapy even if LDL-C is not high, consistent with risk-enhancer logic and the JUPITER results; in secondary prevention or high-risk primary prevention, persistent elevation signals residual inflammatory risk and can justify higher-intensity statins and closer follow-up, recognizing that hs-CRP is not itself a treatment target [^e329dcad] [^93ad0ff0] [^2c71ab4f]. Let me reconsider whether anti-inflammatory drugs beyond statins are indicated: current evidence does not support routine use of agents like methotrexate solely to lower hs-CRP outside trials, so statins and lifestyle remain first-line [^notfound].

> But wait, what about special populations and limitations. In obesity, hs-CRP may be chronically elevated due to adipose-derived IL-6, so I should interpret values cautiously and prioritize weight loss and metabolic risk reduction; nonetheless, even in obese individuals, hs-CRP can still stratify risk and guide therapy when integrated with the overall profile [^29b2ea65]. In acute coronary syndromes, peak CRP correlates with infarct size and adverse remodeling, but hs-CRP measured weeks later reflects residual inflammatory risk and predicts recurrent events, so timing and context matter for interpretation and action [^90fca485] [^6fd987e4].

> I should double-check the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. hs-CRP is a validated, modestly incremental risk marker that is most useful when baseline risk is intermediate and the treatment decision is uncertain; it is not a screening test for everyone, not a substitute for traditional risk factors, and not a causal target, but it can identify patients who benefit from statin therapy and flag residual inflammatory risk on treatment, which is why guidelines have evolved from "consider in select cases" to "obtain a single measurement in routine practice" in 2025 ACC statements [^a61e874a] [^d0bd0b3c]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating universality: the USPSTF still finds insufficient evidence for routine screening in all adults, so shared decision-making and judicious use remain essential until outcome data from broader implementation emerge [^e082212e].

CRP is a **marker of inflammation** [^aed73218] and a validated, independent predictor of cardiovascular risk [^2ebfda4a], especially in primary prevention [^a762a064]. It is best used to refine risk in **intermediate-risk patients** [^2ebfda4a] [^5ef3bcc7] and to guide statin decisions when LDL-C is borderline or normal but hs-CRP is elevated [^c1390c81] [^93ad0ff0]. Routine screening is not recommended for everyone [^e082212e]; measure hs-CRP once in adults 40–75 when risk is borderline or when assessing residual inflammatory risk on therapy [^d0bd0b3c] [^178b21f8]. Values ≥ 2 mg/L indicate higher risk and support more aggressive prevention; repeat testing is advised if the initial result is elevated or unexpected, and results should be interpreted in clinical context [^e329dcad] [^18a945fe].

---

## Clinical significance of CRP in cardiovascular disease

CRP is a **hepatic acute-phase reactant** [^c1a4521c] that rises with systemic inflammation — a key driver of atherogenesis and plaque instability [^7d629bce]. Elevated hs-CRP independently predicts incident CHD, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality [^aed73218], even after adjusting for traditional risk factors [^2ebfda4a].

---

## Measurement and interpretation of CRP levels

High-sensitivity CRP assays detect low-grade inflammation and are the standard for **cardiovascular risk assessment** [^41b1b9ea]. Interpretation uses **three categories**:

| **Crp level (mg/l)** | **Risk category** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1.0 | Low | Low cardiovascular risk |
| 1.0–3.0 | Intermediate | Moderate cardiovascular risk |
| > 3.0 | High | Increased cardiovascular risk |

---

Repeat testing is recommended if the initial result is **elevated or unexpected**, given biological variability and confounders [^18a945fe] [^ab212c97].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Primary prevention**: ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines suggest considering hs-CRP when treatment decisions are uncertain after quantitative risk assessment, particularly in intermediate-risk patients [^a61e874a] [^5671a26a].
- **Secondary prevention**: ACC 2025 recommends recognizing hs-CRP as a powerful predictor of recurrent events in patients with established CVD, including those on statins [^178b21f8].
- **Routine screening**: USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend routine hs-CRP testing for all adults [^e082212e] [^7d779a83].

---

## Clinical scenarios for CRP testing

- **Intermediate risk**: Patients with 10-year ASCVD risk 5–20% where hs-CRP may refine risk and guide therapy [^2ebfda4a] [^5ef3bcc7].
- **Borderline LDL-C**: LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL with elevated hs-CRP supports statin initiation [^c1390c81] [^93ad0ff0].
- **Residual risk**: On-treatment patients with recurrent events or persistent inflammation [^178b21f8] [^23341197].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Non-specificity**: CRP rises with infection, injury, and chronic inflammatory conditions, so interpret in context [^953fcd3f].
- **Variability**: Single measurements can misclassify; repeat if unexpected or elevated [^ab212c97] [^18a945fe].
- **Obesity**: CRP correlates with adiposity, which can confound risk interpretation [^29b2ea65].

---

## Clinical actions based on CRP levels

- **Elevated hs-CRP (≥ 2 mg/L)**: Consider intensifying lifestyle measures and statin therapy, even if LDL-C is normal [^e329dcad] [^93ad0ff0].
- **Normal hs-CRP (< 1 mg/L)**: Continue standard prevention; no immediate change in therapy [^notfound].
- **Persistent elevation**: Evaluate for secondary causes and consider anti-inflammatory strategies or closer follow-up [^b7ff280d].

---

## Recent developments and controversies

Recent guidance emphasizes **residual inflammatory risk** and supports hs-CRP use to identify patients who may benefit from intensified prevention, including higher-intensity statins and lifestyle change [^178b21f8] [^b7ff280d]. Controversy persists about routine screening and whether CRP is causal or simply a marker; Mendelian randomization suggests CRP is likely a marker rather than a direct cause [^c1a4521c] [^b6879812].

---

CRP is a **practical, validated inflammatory biomarker** that refines cardiovascular risk assessment, especially in intermediate-risk patients and those with residual inflammatory risk. It should be used selectively, interpreted in context, and integrated with traditional risk factors to guide prevention strategies.

### Narrative review: assessment of C-reactive protein in risk prediction for cardiovascular disease [^1684445b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Some experts propose C-reactive protein (CRP) as a screening tool for prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many epidemiologic studies show positive associations between elevated CRP levels and incident CVD. Assessment of the value of new prognostic tests, however, must rely on understanding of test characteristics rather than on associations measured by relative risks. In the case of CRP, test characteristics must be judged in the context of currently available CVD risk prediction algorithms. In this review of literature published before January 2006, the authors describe what is known about the additional utility of CRP in risk prediction. They find no definitive evidence that, for most individuals, CRP adds substantial predictive value above that provided by risk estimation using traditional risk factors for CVD. Use of CRP may add to risk estimation in a limited subset of individuals who are at intermediate predicted risk according to the Framingham risk score. The authors propose that many questions still must be addressed before CRP is incorporated into risk prediction algorithms and before universal screening with CRP can be recommended.

### C-reactive protein as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analyses for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^2ebfda4a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) may help to refine global risk assessment for coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly among persons who are at intermediate risk on the basis of traditional risk factors alone.

Purpose

To assist the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in determining whether CRP should be incorporated into guidelines for CHD risk assessment.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles (1966 to November 2007), supplemented by reference lists of reviews, pertinent studies, editorials, and Web sites and by expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Prospective cohort, case-cohort, and nested case-control studies relevant to the independent predictive ability of CRP when used in intermediate-risk persons.

Data Extraction

Included studies were reviewed according to predefined criteria, and the quality of each study was rated.

Data Synthesis

The validity of the body of evidence and the net benefit or harm of using CRP for CHD risk assessment were evaluated. The combined magnitude of effect was determined by meta-analysis. The body of evidence is of good quality, consistency, and applicability. For good studies that adjusted for all Framingham risk variables, the summary estimate of relative risk for incident CHD was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.37 to 1.83) for CRP levels greater than 3.0 mg/L compared with levels less than 1.0 mg/L. Analyses from 4 large cohorts were consistent in finding evidence that including CRP improves risk stratification among initially intermediate-risk persons. C-reactive protein has desirable test characteristics, and good data exist on the prevalence of elevated CRP levels in intermediate-risk persons. Limited evidence links changes in CRP level to primary prevention of CHD events.

Limitations

Study methods for measuring Framingham risk variables and other covariates varied. Ethnic and racial minority populations were poorly represented in most studies, limiting generalizability. Few studies directly assessed the effect of CRP on risk reclassification in intermediate-risk persons.

Conclusion

Strong evidence indicates that CRP is associated with CHD events. Moderate, consistent evidence suggests that adding CRP to risk prediction models among initially intermediate-risk persons improves risk stratification. However, sufficient evidence that reducing CRP levels prevents CHD events is lacking.

### Biomarkers. screening for C-reactive protein in CVD prediction [^c89863de]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Adding C-reactive protein (CRP) level to conventional cardiovascular risk models has been suggested to improve risk prediction for cardiovascular events. However, evaluation of the potential impact of CRP measurement in cardiovascular risk management will require studies designed to quantify the effect of additional CRP assessment on medical decision-making, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.

### Inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk: association or cause and effect? [^ba2a3a19]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

With the current understanding that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, markers of the associated systemic inflammatory response have been extensively studied as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Recently the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed for risk assessment in individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease. The traditional view of inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, regards them as risk markers rather than risk factors. Either category of marker would serve a diagnostic role, monitor disease activity, and indicate the efficacy of therapy or changing prognosis. However a risk factor with a causal role would be a potential target for therapy. This review discusses the available evidence that argues for and against a causal role for inflammatory biomarkers, with specific reference to CRP, in the atherosclerotic process.

### C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease: a critical review [^8765284e]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Modestly elevated baseline concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase protein, are associated with the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in general populations, whilst the major acute phase response of CRP following myocardial infarction is associated with death and cardiac complications. The pathogenic and clinical significance of these associations is controversial. Here we critically review the evidence and describe large-scale epidemiological studies, novel experiments and possible specific therapies which will rigorously inform the debate. We distinguish between the potential pathogenicity of high acute phase circulating CRP concentrations in individuals with substantial tissue damage and modest but persistent increases in baseline values in generally healthy subjects.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease: a resolute belief or an elusive link? [^0b0040c0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) events is well established. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has received the most attention for its use in screening and risk reclassification and as a predictor of clinical response to statin therapy. Although CRP is involved in the immunologic process that triggers vascular remodeling and plaque deposition and is associated with increased CV disease (CVD) risk, definitive randomized evidence for its role as a causative factor in atherothrombosis is lacking. Whether measurement of hsCRP levels provides consistent, clinically meaningful incremental predictive value in risk prediction and reclassification beyond conventional factors remains debated. Despite publication of guidelines on the use of hsCRP in CVD risk prediction by several leading professional organizations, there is a lack of clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical use of hsCRP. This article reviews 4 distinct points from the literature to better understand the current state and application of hsCRP in clinical practice: 1) the biology of hsCRP and its role in atherosclerosis; 2) the epidemiological association of hsCRP with CVD; 3) the quality of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk; and 4) the use of hsCRP as a tool to initiate or tailor statin therapy. Furthermore, we highlight recommendations from societies and important considerations when using hsCRP to guide treatment decisions in the primary prevention setting.

### C-reactive protein comes of age [^7d629bce]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death throughout the world despite advances in its detection and treatment. Commonly used risk algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to identify all affected individuals. Novel cardiovascular risk factors that identify these missed individuals would greatly improve overall care of patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, has emerged as a leading candidate to fulfill this role. Based on the results of several prospective epidemiologic studies, CRP has emerged as one of the most powerful predictors of cardiovascular disease. This marker provides valuable information to clinicians in various clinical settings, ranging from overt cardiovascular disease, stable angina, presenting acute coronary syndromes and peripheral vascular disease, to the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, CRP has been demonstrated to actively contribute to all stages of atherogenesis, participating in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic-plaque formation, plaque maturation, plaque destabilization and eventual rupture. Thus, it might also serve as a therapeutic target. It is our contention that the future will see much wider use of CRP and CRP-driven therapies in clinical medicine, improving our ability to identify and manage cardiovascular disease.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^e5ba8b02]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is much recent evidence demonstrating a strong association between elevated hs-CRP values and atherosclerosis. There remains, however, controversy as to whether CRP itself is pathogenic. Although animal studies suggest that CRP may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, recent Mendelian randomization studies have failed to demonstrate a causal role between CRP levels and atherosclerosis, suggesting that CRP may more likely be a marker than an actual pathogenic component of atherosclerosis.

Ongoing studies should provide important additional information. The Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial aims to further assess the role of CRP as a target for therapy, as well as confirm the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis, in the setting of very-low-dose methotrexate therapy in 7,000 patients with stable coronary artery disease and persistent elevations of CRP.

In any case, hs-CRP has been demonstrated to improve global cardiac risk estimation compared with traditional cardiac risk factor assessment. The Reynolds Risk Score, which takes into account hs-CRP readings, has been shown to improve global CV risk prediction compared with previous assessment of traditional CV risk factors and represents a practical and simple method of risk assessment in the clinical setting.

Further studies are clearly warranted to elucidate the potential pathogenic role of CRP in atherothrombosis and to determine whether CRP is a useful target of therapy. In addition, it remains to be determined if routine use of hs-CRP in risk calculation will definitively improve CV risk estimation.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^28bcba8f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular risk assessment—high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): Evidence indicates hs-CRP is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) events and that adding hs-CRP to risk prediction among initially intermediate-risk persons improves risk stratification, but few studies directly assessed reclassification in intermediate-risk persons and it was not clear whether reclassification led to a net improvement in prediction, with reports suggesting impact probably modest. Broader epidemiology notes continuous associations with coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, vascular mortality, and certain cancers, although the relevance to such a range of disorders is unclear, and a large collaboration did not directly assess value in risk prediction and provided no additional evidence for discrimination, calibration, reclassification, or cost-effectiveness. For myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality, adding hs-CRP to traditional risk factors improves risk prediction, but the clinical relevance and cost-effectiveness remain unclear; absolute differences in c-statistics between models including and not including hs-CRP ranged from 0.00 to 0.027.

### Role of C-reactive protein in coronary risk reduction: focus on primary prevention [^f5290a16]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of current risk assessment strategies, adjunctive markers are needed to improve the prediction of a first coronary event. Research into the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis suggests that inflammatory-response proteins may serve as potential predictors of clinical events. One in particular, C-reactive protein, has been the focus of much attention. Epidemiologic studies have shown a fairly consistent independent association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) elevations and coronary risk, although a causal relation has not yet been established. Given this association, current guidelines recommend the optional use of hs-CRP to predict enhanced absolute risk in selected patients. The use of a marker in general clinical practice should be based on statistical measures that show incremental benefit over established risk factors and on randomized clinical trials in which therapy initiated as a result of marker screening improves patient outcomes. Thus far, statistical evidence concerning the incremental benefit of hs-CRP is not conclusive. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is now being conducted to compare the efficacy of statin therapy versus placebo in subjects considered to be at increased risk on the basis of hs-CRP elevations, despite low to normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, although epidemiologic studies suggest that low-grade C-reactive protein elevations are independently associated with coronary risk, more complete evidence is needed to validate the use of hs-CRP as a risk assessment tool in general practice and as a target for therapy in individual patients.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^ccb69b92]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Newer CV risk stratification strategies incorporating hs-CRP (e.g. Reynolds Risk Score) have also been shown to improve risk stratification better than algorithms incorporating only traditional risk factors. There is also evidence from several landmark statin trials that on-treatment hs-CRP levels predict the likelihood of CV events. Although there is increasing evidence that CRP may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the question of whether reduction in CRP levels and/or its associated downstream effects will provide novel therapeutic avenues to reduce CV risk requires further investigation.

CV diseases are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Recent efforts directed at primary prevention of atherosclerosis have significantly reduced the incidence of initial clinical presentation of atherosclerosis. It is well established that patients with known diabetes or other traditional CV risk factors have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, 15–20% of major CV events occur in patients with no major traditional CV risk factors. As a result, recent preventive efforts have been directed at finding newer, nontraditional, biomarkers to improve risk stratification, particularly in otherwise apparently low-risk individuals.

hs-CRP, previously considered to be an indicator of systemic inflammation, has recently received much attention in the scientific literature, not only as a potential marker of increased atherosclerotic risk, but also as a potential target of therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In this review, we discuss whether hs-CRP should indeed be a target for therapy in the prevention of CV disease as well as other potential clinical implications related to hs-CRP.

### Inflammation and atherosclerosis: role of C-reactive protein in risk assessment [^6d130d35]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation participates critically in atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of several inflammatory markers rise in individuals at risk for atherosclerotic events. In particular, elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific acute-phase reactant that is easily and reliably measured, has strong predictive power for cardiovascular events. Indeed, measurements of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) plasma levels add to both the prognostic information gleaned from assay of plasma lipid risk factors and the risk levels estimated by means of Framingham study-based criteria. Retrospective data suggest the hypothesis that hs-CRP plasma levels may be useful for guiding use of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals who appear to be at low risk according to traditional risk assessment. A large-scale, randomized clinical trial-Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER)-will test whether rosuvastatin therapy will reduce incident cardiovascular disease in subjects with elevated plasma hs-CRP concentrations who do not meet current criteria for initiation of lipid-lowering drug therapy. Such clinical trial data may provide an evidence base for the use of plasma CRP assay as an adjuvant guide to therapy to complement the established traditional risk factors such as plasma lipid levels. Thus, medical practitioners are ushering in an era in which the biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis will find its way into clinical application.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease [^8db3ecc2]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Almost half of first cardiovascular events occur in individuals with no known risk factors. Attempts in the last decade to predict cardiovascular risk more accurately have led to the emergence of a novel risk factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), which has proved to be as good a risk predictor as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. C-reactive protein is an index of inflammation that is now believed to promote directly all stages of atherosclerosis, including plaque rupture. As measured by high-sensitivity assays, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) also independently predicts recurrent events in patients with known coronary artery diseases. Recent evidence implicates hs-CRP, and thus inflammation, in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, particularly in women. As a clinical tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, hs-CRP testing enhances information provided by lipid screening or global risk assessment. Statin therapy and other interventions can lower hs-CRP. Whether or not such reductions can prevent cardiovascular events is under investigation.

### Should we measure C-reactive protein on earth or just on JUPITER? [^f1ed22af]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence for the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is compelling and has generated interest in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a marker of cardiovascular risk. Data regarding hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk, though largely consistent, is of unclear clinical relevance. Most recently, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial has led to further debate regarding the utility of hs-CRP. This article provides a comprehensive review of the data regarding cardiovascular risk and hs-CRP with an emphasis on the JUPITER trial and concludes with an evidence-based analysis of the current role of hs-CRP in cardiovascular risk assessment.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein: potential adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^a762a064]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays a major role in atherothrombosis, and measurement of inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) may provide a novel method for detecting individuals at high risk of plaque rupture. Several large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that HSCRP is a strong independent predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke among apparently healthy men and women and that the addition of HSCRP to standard lipid screening may improve global risk prediction among those with high as well as low cholesterol levels. Because agents such as aspirin and statins seem to attenuate inflammatory risk, HSCRP may also have utility in targeting proven therapies for primary prevention. Inexpensive commercial assays for HSCRP are now available; they have shown variability and classification accuracy similar to that of cholesterol screening. Risk prediction algorithms using a simple quintile approach to HSCRP evaluation have been developed for outpatient use. Thus, although limitations inherent to inflammatory screening remain, available data suggest that HSCRP has the potential to play an important role as an adjunct for global risk assessment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk: from concept to clinical practice to clinical benefit [^727b7697]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Advances in vascular biology have shown that inflammation plays an integral role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Extensive study of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has demonstrated that this measure of inflammation predicts cardiovascular risk not reflected by traditional risk factors, adds prognostic information to traditional risk assessment, and predicts long-term cardiovascular risk in individuals with no prior evidence of cardiovascular disease. Patients with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of elevated cholesterol appear to derive preventive benefit from statin therapy that is similar in magnitude to that in patients with elevated cholesterol. The large-scale Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosvastatin (JUPITER) trial represents a critical study to determine the utility of a strategy for targeting statin therapy to prevent incident cardiovascular disease in patients at increased cardiovascular risk on the basis of elevated hs-CRP who would not be considered candidates for therapy on the basis of hypercholesterolemia or traditional risk assessment. Inclusion of hs-CRP measurement in risk screening and use of this information to guide preventive therapy could result in a marked improvement in prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

CRP AS A TARGET FOR THERAPY

The largest study to suggest an integral role for CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease is the recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial. The investigators randomized 17,802 men ≥50 years of age and women ≥60 years of age with low LDL cholesterol levels <130 mg/dL and hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L and no history of CV disease or diabetes to 20 mg rosuvastatin daily or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, or CV death.

JUPITER was terminated early because of evidence of a reduction in CV morbidity and mortality in patients treated with rosuvastatin compared with placebo. During the 1.9-year median follow-up duration (maximum follow-up period 5 years), rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 50% and hs-CRP by 37%, and this result was associated with a 44% reduction in the JUPITER primary trial end point (P < 0.00001; 95% CI 0.46–0.69). Moreover, the NNT extrapolated out to 5 years to prevent one major event was only 25, a value that is less than that associated with the use of statin therapy for primary prevention among individuals with more overt hyperlipidemia (Fig. 1). Thus, despite targeting a population outside current guidelines and with low levels of LDL cholesterol, JUPITER demonstrated a magnitude of effect larger than that of almost all prior statin trials. Based on the results of the JUPITER study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010 agreed to broader labeling for rosuvastatin. As per the FDA, rosuvastatin is currently approved for the reduction of risk for stroke, MI, and revascularization procedures in individuals who have normal LDL cholesterol levels and no clinically evident CHD but who do have an increased risk based on age, CRP levels, and the presence of at least one additional CVD risk factor.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein in every chart? The use of biomarkers in individual patients [^dd233d17]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) for risk stratification for cardiovascular disease is supported by epidemiologic evidence but remains controversial. The metabolic milieu in which hsCRP is likely to be elevated, namely abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, provides a framework for the understanding of the role of hsCRP as well its limitations. This commentary provides a critical assessment of the data in support of the use of hsCRP in clinical practice.

CLINICAL UTILITY OF CRP

Whereas the potential of hs-CRP as a therapeutic target for the prevention of CV disease remains unresolved, hs-CRP has been demonstrated to have other clinical utilities.

In particular, hs-CRP may be useful in cardiac risk prediction. Traditional CV risk prediction algorithms such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to take into account family history of premature CV disease and nontraditional risk biomarkers such as hs-CRP. The Reynolds Risk Score, in contrast, is a recently developed CV risk prediction algorithm that incorporates the hs-CRP value and family history in addition to the traditional risk factors.

The Reynolds Risk Score was initially developed and validated in women and was shown to improve global CV risk prediction. For example, it reclassified 40–50% of the women who were at intermediate risk (5–20% 10-year risk) into either higher- or lower-risk categories. In addition, global CV risk prediction with the Reynolds Risk Score more accurately matched actual event rates. The Reynolds Risk Score has subsequently been validated in men, again with improved CV global risk prediction. A total of 15–20% of men at intermediate risk were reclassified into higher- or lower-risk categories.

Beyond global risk prediction of CV events, an association between higher hs-CRP levels and new onset of future diabetes has been demonstrated. In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), another primary prevention statin trial, which studied the effects of pravastatin on 6,595 men with high LDL cholesterol levels, it was found that high hs-CRP levels (defined as >3 mg/L) (in combination with the presence of metabolic syndrome) demonstrated greatest prognostication for both CHD as well as future onset of diabetes. Another study found that hs-CRP was independently associated with insulin levels in nondiabetic women, strengthening the previously elucidated association between hs-CRP levels and increased risk of future diabetes.

### C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and cardiovascular disease prediction [^5ef3bcc7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is debate about the value of assessing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other biomarkers of inflammation for the prediction of first cardiovascular events.

Methods

We analyzed data from 52 prospective studies that included 246,669 participants without a history of cardiovascular disease to investigate the value of adding CRP or fibrinogen levels to conventional risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular risk. We calculated measures of discrimination and reclassification during follow-up and modeled the clinical implications of initiation of statin therapy after the assessment of CRP or fibrinogen.

Results

The addition of information on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a prognostic model for cardiovascular disease that included age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol level increased the C-index, a measure of risk discrimination, by 0.0050. The further addition to this model of information on CRP or fibrinogen increased the C-index by 0.0039 and 0.0027, respectively (P<0.001), and yielded a net reclassification improvement of 1.52% and 0.83%, respectively, for the predicted 10-year risk categories of "low" (<10%), "intermediate" (10% to <20%), and "high" (≥20%) (P<0.02 for both comparisons). We estimated that among 100,000 adults 40 years of age or older, 15,025 persons would initially be classified as being at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event if conventional risk factors alone were used to calculate risk. Assuming that statin therapy would be initiated in accordance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (i.e., for persons with a predicted risk of ≥20% and for those with certain other risk factors, such as diabetes, irrespective of their 10-year predicted risk), additional targeted assessment of CRP or fibrinogen levels in the 13,199 remaining participants at intermediate risk could help prevent approximately 30 additional cardiovascular events over the course of 10 years.

Conclusions

In a study of people without known cardiovascular disease, we estimated that under current treatment guidelines, assessment of the CRP or fibrinogen level in people at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event could help prevent one additional event over a period of 10 years for every 400 to 500 people screened.

### Association between serum level of C-reactive protein and risk of cardiovascular events based on cohort studies [^420a69c2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the association between serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) has been reported, the comprehensive assessment of the quantitative association of CRP level with risk of CVEs has not been reported. Our meta-analysis aims to quantitatively evaluate the association of CRP level and risk of CVEs. We searched PubMed and Embase databases for articles published up to December 6, 2019. Studies with data on men and women, different types of CVEs and multiple cohorts within a study were treated as independent studies. Generalized least-squares regression models were used to assess the quantitative association between CRP level and risk of CVEs. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the possible linear association between CRP and CVEs. We included 36 articles (60 studies; 227,715 participants) in the analysis. The pooled relative risks (RRs) of high versus low CRP level for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) were 1.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-1.82), 1.46 (95% CI, 1.35-1.58), and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.47-1.63), respectively. A linear association was found between CRP level and CVD (P=0.429), stroke (P=0.940), and CHD (P=0.931); with each 1-mg/L increase in CRP level, the pooled RRs for CVD, stroke, and CHD were 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.24), 1.07 (95% CI, 1.04-1.09), and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.08-1.16), respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that risk of CVEs increases with increasing serum CRP level.

### C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms, C-reactive protein blood levels, and cardiovascular disease risk [^8a92826b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of inflammation and a hallmark of the acute-phase response, has been shown to be a powerful and specific predictor of cardiovascular event risk in populations of otherwise healthy persons. Here we review what is known about CRP gene polymorphisms, discuss how these might affect the epidemiology of CRP and our understanding of CRP's contribution to cardiovascular disease, and examine their potential clinical usefulness. Evidence shows that certain subtle variations in the CRP gene sequence, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms, predictably and strongly influence the blood level of CRP. Some of these variations are associated with clinical correlates of cardiovascular disease. If future studies can establish with certainty that CRP influences cardiovascular biology, then CRP gene profiling could have clinical utility.

### C-reactive protein is a mediator of cardiovascular disease [^5ba60500]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein is postulated to embody an index that can reflect cardiovascular risk and can be used to independently predict major cardiovascular events and mortality. On the other hand, credible experimental data have become available that demonstrate the abundant presence of C-reactive protein in atherosclerotic lesions and, moreover, identify C-reactive protein as an initiator of several pathogenic pathways that can cause atherogenic changes. Consequently, there has been a paradigm shift in which C-reactive protein is no longer regarded as merely an indicator of cardiovascular risk, but increasingly considered a direct partaker in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These data underscore the need to explore risk-reducing interventions that selectively inhibit C-reactive protein activity as a novel strategy to prevent clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis.

### C-reactive protein and hypertension [^66b2bf29]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototypical acute-phase reactant, is one of the most widely known biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. Circulating levels of CRP are clinically used to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events and to aide in the selection of therapies based on more accurate risk assessment in individuals who are at intermediate risk. This paper reviews the role of CRP in hypertension. In hypertensive individuals, CRP levels associate with vascular stiffness, atherosclerosis and the development of end-organ damage and cardiovascular events. Data suggest that some anti-hypertensive medications may lower CRP levels in a manner independent of their effect on blood pressure. In individuals who are normotensive at baseline, CRP levels have been shown in multiple cohorts to foretell the development of hypertension on follow-up. Whether genetic variability that influences circulating levels of CRP independent of environmental and behavioral factors can also be used in a similar manner to predict the change in blood pressure and development of hypertension is controversial. In addition to its role as a biomarker, experimental studies have unraveled an active direct participation of CRP in the development of endothelial dysfunction, vascular stiffness and elevated blood pressure. CRP has also been implicated as a mediator of vascular remodeling in response to injury and cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload. Emerging data may reveal novel vascular inflammatory pathways and identify new targets for treatment of vascular pathology.

### The use of high-sensitivity assays for C-reactive protein in clinical practice [^41b1b9ea]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity assays that accurately measure levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein have been proposed for use in assessments of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A growing body of evidence supports recommendations for these tests in selected asymptomatic individuals deemed to be at intermediate risk of CVD according to traditional risk-factor assessments and who do not already warrant chronic treatment with aspirin and statin therapy. Data suggests that these high-sensitivity assays should be used in combination with measurements of LDL-cholesterol levels to assist risk stratification of selected patients for prevention of CVD.

### Utility of C-reactive protein measurement in risk stratification during primary cardiovascular disease prevention [^e9c5057c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) adds prognostic information beyond that provided by the Framingham risk score. The clinical utility of hs-CRP evaluation per guidelines was investigated by determining how it changed the cardiovascular risk stratification of 100 patients deemed at intermediate risk. Screening guidelines defined the cardiovascular risk due to hs-CRP as low (<1.0 mg/L), intermediate (1.0 to 3.0 mg/L), or high (>3.0 mg/L). After hs-CRP evaluation, risk was adjusted in 66% of the patients. Because hs-CRP evaluation significantly altered the cardiovascular risk strata of most intermediate-risk patients, it may therefore be a useful test during primary cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Inflammation and cardiovascular disease: 2025 ACC scientific statement: a report of the American college of cardiology [^23341197]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The crucial role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has recently gained increased attention. In particular, residual inflammation, measured with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains strongly predictive of recurrent events, even in statin-treated patients. Similarly, elevated hsCRP in apparently healthy individuals identifies a higher-risk group in whom statin therapy significantly reduces the risk of first major CVD events even if LDL-cholesterol is normal. This report provides an updated understanding of the role of chronic, low-grade inflammation in CVD and highlights new seminal research findings, especially in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pericarditis. Consensus recommendations are summarized for screening, evaluation, and CVD risk assessment; inflammatory biomarkers in cardiovascular imaging; inflammation inhibition in behavioral and lifestyle risks; and anti-inflammatory approaches in primary and secondary prevention as well as in heart failure and other CVDs. This report also addresses current challenges and future opportunities. For example, it cautions that not all trials of anti-inflammatory therapy in secondary prevention have been successful and such trial evidence is needed before broad recommendations for other agents can be made. Additionally, in successful trials, the interplay between inflammation and key physiological systems often remains incompletely examined. Another promising area of research is the role that novel special pro-resolving bioactive lipid molecules play in promoting the resolution of inflammation and CVD risk reduction. In aggregate, the evidence linking inflammation with atherosclerotic CVD is no longer exploratory but is compelling and clinically actionable. The time for taking action has now arrived.

### C-reactive protein and the prediction of cardiovascular events among those at intermediate risk: moving an inflammatory hypothesis toward consensus [^cb5597ab]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Over 20 large-scale prospective studies show that the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events that additionally predicts risk of incident hypertension and diabetes. In many studies, the relative impact of hsCRP is at least as large as that individually of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, or smoking, and knowledge of hsCRP correctly reclassifies a substantial proportion of "intermediate-risk" individuals into clinically relevant higher- or lower-risk categories. Other studies show the relative benefit of statins to be greater among those with increased hsCRP and that achieved hsCRP levels after statin therapy predict recurrent event rates as much as achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nonetheless, it remains controversial whether the time has come to modify traditional algorithms used for global risk detection. As described here, 6 areas of controversy regarding hsCRP are resolvable with a consensus position that focuses in primary prevention on selective use among individuals with 5% to 20% 10-year risk as estimated by Adult Treatment Panel III, and focuses in secondary prevention on high-risk patients being treated with statin therapy. Forthcoming trial data could expand or contract this "screen selectively" policy, and investigators should be open to the possibility that second-generation inflammatory biomarkers may be developed that supplant hsCRP altogether. In the meantime, however, this consensus position on hsCRP should be one to which both advocates and critics of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis can adhere because it is one that can immediately improve patient care.

### Cumulative exposure to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease [^ab212c97]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, making it important to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, as well as the preventive strategies. Inflammation is essential to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, 1, 2 the basic pathological process of most CVD. 3, 4, 5 Owing to fact that changes in vascular inflammation can be hard to evaluate by current cardiac imaging methods, the role of circulating inflammatory biomarkers is increasing. Among the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers, hs‐CRP (high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein) has been the most profoundly studied and received much more attention for its prospect as a cost‐effective and stable predictor for CVD screening and risk reclassification. 6 Multiple prospective cohort studies, including the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) Study, have reported that increased CRP (C‐reactive protein) levels were significantly associated with increased CVD event risk. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Data from a stroke‐free, multiethnic, and community‐based cohort study, NOMAS (the Northern Manhattan Study), have suggested that participants with hs‐CRP >3 mg/L were at significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–2.77), but the ability of hs‐CRP to predict cerebrovascular events was not confirmed. 12 It is noteworthy that previous analyses to investigate whether hs‐CRP really predicts future cardiovascular events were based on a single hs‐CRP measurement, and variability in hs‐CRP concentration remains unaccounted for. 13, 14, 15 However, a single measurement of high hs‐CRP does not mean that the body state has sustained a high hs‐CRP for a long time. In addition, metabolic dysregulation, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, dietary patterns, environmental pollutant burden, and potential inflammation, may lead to incidental high hs‐CRP concentration. Thus, a single high hs‐CRP may lead to incorrect classification of the risk assessment for CVD events.

### C-reactive protein and other emerging blood biomarkers to optimize risk stratification of vulnerable patients [^458e984f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Several emerging plasma biomarkers may ultimately prove useful in risk stratification and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The clinical utility of these biomarkers will depend on their ability to provide a reflection of the underlying atherosclerotic burden or activity; the ability to provide reliable, accurate, and cost-effective information; and the ability to predict future events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) fulfills many, if not all, of these criteria, and blood levels of hs-CRP are now commonly used in clinical practice to improve vascular risk prediction in primary and secondary prevention across all levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), all levels of the Framingham Risk Score, and all levels of metabolic syndrome. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein may also have clinical relevance as an adjunct to LDL-C for both the targeting and monitoring of statin therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that several other selected emerging biomarkers may also potentially prove useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, data are accumulating on the potential clinical utility of lipoprotein-associated lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, myeloperoxidase, oxidized LDL, lipoprotein (a), isoprostanes, and small, dense LDL. This review focuses on hs-CRP and these emerging plasma biomarkers, and their potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in cardiovascular disease. Plasma biomarkers that reflect the clinical potential of atherothrombotic disease may allow more precise risk stratification and prognostication in high-risk populations, and perhaps earlier diagnosis and intervention in patients at risk for or with occult cardiovascular disease.

### C-reactive protein during and after myocardial infarction in relation to cardiac injury and left ventricular function at follow-up [^90fca485]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this observational study, we examined the different roles of CRP measured in the acute phase of MI compared to levels at 1 month follow‐up for the prediction of left ventricular function. Peak CRP during hospitalization with acute MI is associated with markers of acute cardiac injury and is an independent predictor of left ventricular dysfunction at follow‐up. However, hsCRP 1 month post‐MI as marker of ongoing inflammation appears not to be associated with the extent of acute cardiac injury or ejection fraction at follow‐up. These findings may be relevant for the timing of novel anti‐inflammatory therapies in ischemic heart disease.

The observation that specifically peak levels of CRP are related to infarct size and left ventricular function at follow‐up confirms findings from previous studies. 2, 3 Peak CRP may therefore be taken into account when gauging the risk of adverse outcome in patients with MI. Myocardial ischemia results in a well‐orchestrated inflammatory response, including the release of damage associated molecular patterns by the ischemic myocardium, the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the infarcted myocardium and induction of healing. 1 Limiting the extent of cardiac injury blunts the CRP response. 13 An imbalanced or excessive inflammatory response may therefore correlate with clinical outcomes. Since CRP is produced by the liver as result of an upstream cascade, and depending on the magnitude of recruitment of cells to the myocardium, it may take up to 48 hours to reach peak levels.

Although the inflammatory and proliferative phase after MI may last up to several weeks, we were not able show a correlation between hsCRP measured 1 month post‐MI and left ventricular function further on. 4 Nevertheless, hsCRP 1 month post‐MI is a known predictor of recurrent ischemic events 8, 14 and cardiovascular death, including pump failure. 15 It is also increased in patients with stable heart failure. 16, 17 These observations suggest that hsCRP measured 1 month post‐MI might at least in part be driven by other pathophysiological mechanisms, rather than inflammation related to the infarct healing process itself. Alternatively, hsCRP may be not the correct marker to assess cardiac inflammation 1 month post‐MI.

Since chronic low‐grade inflammation relates to ischemic events, the inflammation caused by acute infarction may increase susceptibility to recurrent events. 18 One study showed that patients with a large MI and consequently high inflammatory activation were at increased risk of recurrent events compared to patients with smaller MIs. 19 The increased number of recurrent events were especially observed in the first 30 days post‐MI and not thereafter, suggesting that the infarct size‐induced inflammation may have subsided after 30 days.

### Evaluation of C-reactive protein prior to and on-treatment as a predictor of benefit from atorvastatin: observations from the anglo-scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial [^ad9a89ad]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Certain inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, have been shown to be associated with risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease independent of classical risk markers, including LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c). In several trials, statin therapy has been shown to lower circulating C-reactive protein. In the recent JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, the extent to which C-reactive protein is lowered by statins was reported to predict CV outcomes independently of LDL-c lowering.Indeed, authors have argued that the JUPITER trial provides confirmation of the value of C-reactive protein in determining CV risk.This finding is at variance with data from existing meta-analyses, which suggest that the ‘anti-inflammatory’ effect of statins may be a secondary effect of LDL-c reduction and that LDL-c reduction accounts for most of the benefit of statins. To further investigate this controversial issue, we have conducted a nested case–control study on participants recruited into ASCOT. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) baseline C-reactive protein (i.e. prior to randomization) is associated with and improves CV disease risk prediction, (ii) that baseline C-reactive protein modifies the efficacy of statins in reducing CV events, and (iii) that C-reactive protein levels during statin use predict statin efficacy independently of LDL-c reduction.

### Inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (...) [^2a7537d0]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Markers of systemic inflammation can predict future cardiovascular events in healthy persons and patients with coronary artery disease. Measurement of certain inflammatory markers can help identify high-risk patients, monitor disease activity, and provide a therapeutic guide for reducing the inflammatory component of the disease. Fibrinogen and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are the inflammatory markers most extensively studied for their relation to cardiovascular risk. Rosenson and Koenig reviewed the effectiveness of fibrinogen and high-sensitivity CRP measurement in evaluating and managing cardiovascular disease risk. Fibrinogen and CRP are associated independently with a variety of cardiovascular end points in unhealthy and apparently healthy patients. Fibrinogen is involved directly in coagulation, and CRP is a sensitive marker of inflammation and tissue damage. In patients with stable angina, fibrinogen and CRP levels are predictors of cardiac events.

A CRP level of at least 3 mg per L predicts more ischemic episodes and the need for revascularization procedures; fibrinogen also has prognostic value in this circumstance. Measuring fibrinogen and high-sensitivity CRP levels can identify patients at increased risk for coronary events. High-sensitivity CRP levels are a better measure and more reproducible than fibrinogen levels. The Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events Trial demonstrated that combined therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was more effective than aspirin alone in preventing cardiovascular events, and this combination may be considered, especially in patients with coronary artery disease and elevated high-sensitivity CRP levels.

The authors conclude that high-sensitivity CRP measurement is appropriate in high-risk cardiovascular patients, and that patients with elevated levels should be given more intense treatment, including weight reduction, exercise and, when indicated by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, an increased dosage of statins, or lipid-lowering therapy combined with niacin or a fibrate. editor's note: The American Heart Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 1 have studied the effectiveness of inflammatory markers in clinical cardiac care and prevention. CRP appears to have the strongest association with cardiovascular disease, especially when the high-sensitivity CRP assay is used. Inflammatory marker measurements can vary with specific patient characteristics. The conclusion of the AHA/CDC report is that high-sensitivity CRP is probably the best supported inflammatory marker and should be measured twice.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^a97d1821]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Cumulative incidence of CV events according to study group. Significant relative risk reduction of the primary composite end point of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, revascularization, and CV death in JUPITER is shown. Hazard ratio for rosuvastatin compared with placebo group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.46–0.69, P < 0.00001). Adapted from Ridker et al.

JUPITER also provided further credence for the “dual target” hypothesis. In a prespecified analysis, a 65% reduction in major events was noted in patients who achieved LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dL and hs-CRP <2 mg/L versus a 33% reduction in patients who realized only one or neither target (P < 0.0001 across treatment groups). Accordingly, JUPITER not only demonstrated that hs-CRP successfully identified a population with “hidden risk” for CV disease but also provided additional evidence for the potential utility of hs-CRP as a target for therapy in primary prevention of CV disease.

Is there any basic science rationale for hs-CRP as a target for therapy?

There is an accumulating body of literature demonstrating a role for CRP as a putative mediator of atherosclerosis, independently and in synergy with other traditional risk factors, such as LDL cholesterol. The mechanisms through which CRP is thought to potentiate atherosclerosis are numerous and diverse. Our understanding of atherosclerosis over the last 3 decades has undergone a paradigm shift from that of a lipid-centric disease to one that is centered on inflammation. Cumulative evidence indicates that inflammation is an active component in all phases of atherosclerosis, from early plaque initiation, to plaque development, rupture, and ultimately acute coronary occlusions (Fig. 2). The results of the hs-CRP blood test are thought to reflect the inflammatory process. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo models of CV disorders including hypertension and thrombosis support this contention and, consequently, there is much interest in CRP as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. Under physiological conditions, the monolayer endothelium releases an array of substances that interact to promote overall vascular health. A disturbance in endothelial integrity triggers disturbances in the release and activity of these factors, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, a critical initial step in atherosclerosis that often occurs in the absence of angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease and is a common feature of hypertension- and thrombosis-associated complexities.

Methodology and evidence review—novel multivariable risk equations were developed for prediction of 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in non-Hispanic African-American and non-Hispanic white men and women from 40 to 79 years of age, with 10-year risk defined as a first ASCVD event (nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease (CHD) death or fatal or nonfatal stroke) over a 10-year period among people free from ASCVD, derived from several long-standing population-based cohort studies funded by the NHLBI; the Work Group also addressed 2 CQs on “reclassification or contribution to risk assessment” when adding markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), ankle-brachial index (ABI), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), or coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to standard risk factor scores, and whether long-term (≥15 years or lifetime) risk models effectively assess variation among adults at low or intermediate short-term risk.

### C-reactive protein and prognosis in diabetes: getting to the heart of the matter [^7e35525f]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Some commentators have argued that the results of the recent JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial provide confirmation of the value of CRP in determining CVD risk. However, JUPITER was a randomized controlled trial of a statin in people with low LDL cholesterol but high CRP. Statins lower CRP but also lower LDL cholesterol, and so it can be difficult to distinguish whether reductions in risk observed were due to LDL lowering, CRP lowering, or some combination. This is the case even among people with low starting LDL cholesterol concentration because of the log-linear association of LDL cholesterol with vascular risk over the whole range of usual values, which suggests that a salutary effect of LDL cholesterol lowering might be expected irrespective of the starting LDL cholesterol value.

In summary, therefore, although CRP commands much interest as a CVD risk factor, higher-resolution observational epidemiology (such as that in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration), continued genetic epidemiology, and eventually specific CRP inhibitors are needed to help the vascular risk community make a more balanced judgment on any causal role and utility of CRP as a predictor of risk. Such efforts also need to be cognizant of a range of competing and overlapping risk factors, since some may have distinct benefits over CRP. Presently, therefore, the current focus in clinical practice should remain on established risk factors (e.g. smoking, lipids, and blood pressure), both in determining coronary heart disease risk and as targets for prevention.

### C-reactive protein and prognosis in diabetes: getting to the heart of the matter [^e2a2bda3]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

In a recent systematic review of 31 prospective cohorts, CRP did not perform better than the established Framingham risk equation for discrimination. Moreover, improvement in risk stratification or reclassification from the addition of CRP was small and inconsistent. As such, the conclusion by Bruno et al. regarding the marginal value of CRP in predicting mortality risk in diabetic patients should not be too surprising. The efforts of the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, which has established a central database of over 1.1 million participants from 104 prospective population-based studies, in which subsets have information on inflammatory markers as well as major cardiovascular morbidity and cause-specific mortality, will help define whether there are subgroups of risk in which CRP measurement will be more helpful.

Of course, CRP is not the only “new” risk factor being considered for a role in CVD risk prediction. Indeed, measures of obesity, socioeconomic status, and family history of premature CVD all in part capture inflammation signals, and all may be more easily obtained than CRP. A significant correlation to inflammation is also evident for the ankle-brachial index, a measure that appears to significantly enhance risk prediction beyond the Framingham risk score.

### CDC / AHA workshop on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease: application to clinical and public health practice: clinical use of inflammatory markers in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a background paper [^6fd987e4]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a recognized key component of acute coronary syndromes. Such pathogenetic achievement has led to the use of inflammatory cells and proteins as prognostic markers in these syndromes. A number of markers have been proposed, including proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1RA, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adhesion molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 and markers of cell activation. Although all are of scientific interest, the clinical use of these markers is limited by their high cost, low availability, and unfavorable biological profile. Conversely, common markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototypic acute phase protein, and to a lesser extent fibrinogen, have been proven to be reliable and important markers of risk in ischemic heart disease. CRP, in particular, has been found to be associated with short- and long-term prognosis in acute coronary syndromes, including ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in stable angina, and to predict the risk of restenosis and major events, including death, after revascularization procedures. CRP has been consistently found to be independent from other risk factors and to have an incremental value beyond the common risk factors and biochemical markers of risk, including troponin. Whether CRP also should be used as a guide to therapy is still a matter of discussion that deserves further, properly designed studies.

### Risk assessment for cardiovascular disease with nontraditional risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5e614f39]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors—biomarker and imaging thresholds—are described as follows: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) involves a single blood sample and is widely available, and a threshold of greater than 2 or 3 mg/L is used in clinical practice to signify increased cardiovascular risk; for coronary artery calcium (CAC), scoring systems vary, but the baseline comparison is often a CAC score of 0.

### C-reactive protein modulates risk prediction based on the framingham score: implications for future risk assessment: results from a large cohort study in Southern Germany [^dd36ad56]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Framingham Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) prediction score is recommended for global risk assessment in subjects prone to CHD. Recently, C-reactive protein (CRP) has emerged as an independent predictor of CHD. We sought to assess the potential of CRP measurements to enhance risk prediction based on the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in a large cohort of middle-aged men from the general population.

Methods and Results

We measured CRP and traditional cardiovascular risk factors at baseline in 3435 white men of German nationality, 45 to 74 years of age. All men were drawn from 3 random samples of the general population in the Augsburg area located in Southern Germany in 1984 to 1985, 1989 to 1990, and 1994 to 1995 (response rate, 80%), and the FRS was calculated in all of them. Outcome was defined as nonfatal and fatal coronary events, including sudden cardiac death. During an average follow-up of 6.6 years, a total of 191 coronary events occurred. Cox regression showed a significant contribution of CRP to coronary event risk prediction independent of the FRS (P=0.0002). In stratified analysis for 5 categories of FRS, CRP significantly added prognostic information to the FRS in subjects in 2 intermediate risk categories (P=0.03 and P=0.02).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that CRP enhances global coronary risk as assessed by the FRS, especially in intermediate risk groups. This might have implications for future risk assessment.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^d2880e8d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Critical Question 1 (CQ1)—novel risk markers in cardiovascular risk assessment: This question applies to the general population—the typical asymptomatic adult in routine clinical practice—and does not address highly selected patient subgroups with symptoms suggestive of CVD. CQ1 was addressed through 2 independent approaches: testing additional markers in the Pooled Cohort Equations when available with at least 10 years of follow-up, and a 2-stage review of meta-analyses and systematic reviews published before September 19, 2013, with the first stage identifying those published before April 2011. The final list of markers included hs-CRP, ApoB, creatinine [or estimated glomerular filtration rate], microalbuminuria, CAC, CIMT, ABI, family history, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Thirteen systematic review articles or meta-analyses met inclusion with publication dates from 2008 to 2013, and none of these markers has been evaluated as a screening test in randomized controlled trials with clinical events as outcomes. On the basis of current (limited) evidence, it is the opinion of the Work Group that family history of premature CVD and measurement of hs-CRP, CAC, and ABI show some promise for clinical utility, and Table 6 provides expert opinion on thresholds of these measures that may be considered for clinical decision making.

### Cardiovascular health trajectories and elevated C-reactive protein: the CARDIA study [^447c5867]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.In 2010, the American Heart Association established “Life’s Simple 7,” a conglomeration of metrics aimed at defining cardiovascular health (CVH).Seven health factors (blood cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], and fasting plasma glucose) and behaviors (diet quality, physical activity [PA], smoking, and body mass index [BMI]) are emphasized within the construct, each being scored either into ideal, intermediate, or poor categories. The sum of the scores for each factor provides an individual’s CVH score. Artero et al. found that the achievement of each additional ideal CVH metric was associated with a graded reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.Furthermore, multiple studies have found inverse associations of CVH score and future CVD outcomes.,,,

Cardiovascular disease has been classified as a chronic inflammatory disease.CRP (C‐reactive protein) is a systemic inflammatory marker, secreted primarily by hepatocytes in response to interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha.CRP activates multiple atherogenic processes including, but not limited to, monocyte cytokine expression, expression of adhesion molecules, and platelet aggregation.Multiple studies support CRP as an independent risk factor for CVD, with its individual predictive utility comparable to that of total and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol or BP.,The American Heart Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify an elevated CRP concentration of >3.0 mg/L as high risk.Although CRP is a significant, independent predictor of CVD outcomes, a recent review found that when added to traditional risk factor models, the performance of CRP in improving CVD risk classification was inconsistent across 25 studies,with minimal effect on prediction shown in the largest study (increased C‐index by 0.0039 and net reclassification improvement of 1.52%).Nevertheless, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology recommend the additional measurement of newer risk markers, such as CRP, to inform treatment decisions if quantitative risk assessment via traditional risk factors results in an uncertain treatment decision.While we recognize these previous studies and their findings on the associations between CRP and CVD, we propose to explore a different relationship where traditional CVD risk factors, compiled into the CVH score, are associated with the risk of elevated CRP levels.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment – from individual risk prediction to estimation of global risk and change in risk in the population [^4be3e479]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The advent of other markers of CV disease, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), or coronary calcification scores [-], have been shown to predict incident coronary disease but they add little prognostic value to standard risk formulae and their incorporation into present clinical practice has been challenging. High sensitivity CRP is associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even hypertension. Yet studies have shown a minimal incremental value of adding new biomarkers to existing prediction models in a recent study by the Framingham group. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence in potentially using CRP, particularly using the Reynolds Risk Score, to re-classify intermediate risk subjects into a high risk category for potential interventions. In addition, detection of subclinical coronary artery disease with screening tests like CT to measure coronary calcium has been a topic of a recent debate. The AHA Consensus document which outlined the likely benefit of using this modality to risk-stratify intermediate risk patients to either high or low categories depending on the score. This group did not recommend its use in either low or high-risk patients. The utility of biomarkers for the detection of subclinical coronary disease for risk stratification may be limited in individuals believed to be at high CV risk, who for some reason have an FRS that is not too high, but these biomarkers are possibly useful in those with intermediate risk.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in primary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a single measurement of hs-CRP (> 3 mg/L) in routine clinical practice to identify patients at increased inflammatory risk, provided the patient is not acutely ill.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular risk: rationale for screening and primary prevention [^68ff12f5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a major factor in atherothrombotic disease. Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and a mediator of atherothrombotic disease, have been shown to correlate with cardiovascular disease risk. Recent findings in 27,939 healthy women in the Women's Health Study indicate that hs-CRP (1) is a stronger predictor of risk than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, (2) predicts elevated risk in subjects without overt hyperlipidemia, and (3) adds prognostic information to risk scoring and LDL cholesterol categories. Other data from this cohort show that hs-CRP level adds prognostic information to the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome. Taken together with other data in men on the association of hs-CRP with vascular risk, a strong argument is provided for screening in the primary prevention population. With regard to potential treatment, statins have been found to reduce hs-CRP levels, and data from statin treatment trials raise the possibility that subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels may derive greater benefit from treatment than do patients without elevated hs-CRP. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial is planned to examine the effects of rosuvastatin treatment in preventing cardiovascular events in 15,000 healthy subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of overt hyperlipidemia.

8. Cardiac C-Reactive Protein Cardiac CRP assays are indicated for use as an aid in the identification and stratification of individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease.

When used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, cCRP may be useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events in patients with stable. coronary disease or acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac CRP assays, like hsCRP assays, have measurement ranges that extend below the measurement range typical of most conventional CRP assays. The difference between hsCRP and cCRP is not the analyte itself, but is due to the additional performance validation to support the expanded intended use in. format for stating performance claims. You should evaluate precision at relevant CRP concentrations, including near medical decision points, and concentrations near the limits of reportable range. We recommend that for hsCRP and cCRP assays, one level should be at the American Heart Association/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical cutoff for low risk category. In determining the LOQ, we recommend that you follow “Protocols for determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline, .

### Usefulness of C-reactive protein and left ventricular function for risk assessment in survivors of acute myocardial infarction [^ef9351b3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The additional prognostic information provided by C-reactive protein (CRP) to parameters of left ventricular function in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was investigated in 665 patients (326 with ST elevation and 339 with non-ST elevation). Cox multivariable analysis identified the following predictors of 6-month cardiac death: age (per 5 years hazard ratio [HR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 1.4, p = 0.004), Killip class >I at presentation (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.5, p = 0.0001), a reduced ejection fraction (per 5% HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4, p = 0.0001), and greater CRP (per 5 mg/L HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04, p = 0.02); the C-index of the model was 0.77 without and 0.78 with CRP. CRP is associated with mortality in addition to age and parameters of ventricular function (Killip class and ejection fraction) in survivors of AMI, although the relevance of its additive predictive role seems marginal.

### C-reactive protein, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular disease risk [^953fcd3f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is uncertain to what extent high C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations reflect the presence of inflammatory conditions in the community.

Methods

We evaluated 3782 Framingham Offspring Study participants (mean age 55 years; 52% women) free of baseline cardiovascular disease. Logistic regression models examined the prevalence of common inflammatory conditions by CRP categories, while a separate matched case-referent analysis evaluated the prevalence of uncommon inflammatory conditions. Cox models were used to assess the influence of common inflammatory conditions on relations between CRP and incident cardiovascular disease.

Results

Common inflammatory conditions were reported by nearly half of the participants; these individuals were more likely to have markedly high CRP concentrations (>10 mg/L, P for trend=.001). In multivariable models, there were increased odds of having at least one common inflammatory condition with CRP concentrations of 1-3.0, 3.01-10, and >10 mg/L, compared with the referent category (<1 mg/L); the respective odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were 1.41 (1.07-1.86), 1.45 (1.07-1.98), and 1.64 (1.09-2.47) in men, and 1.08 (0.82-1.43), 1.07 (0.80-1.44), and 1.38 (0.97-1.96) in women. In case-referent analyses, uncommon inflammatory conditions were more common in individuals with CRP >10 mg/L compared with those with CRP <1 mg/L (12.1% vs 6.6%; P=.0001). In multivariable models, higher CRP categories were not associated with incident cardiovascular disease, and with additional adjustment for inflammatory conditions, results remained unchanged.

Conclusion

There is high prevalence of common and uncommon inflammatory conditions in individuals with high CRP concentrations. Higher CRP concentrations should be interpreted with caution in cardiovascular disease risk assessment.

### CDC / AHA workshop on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease: application to clinical and public health practice: ability of inflammatory markers to predict disease in asymptomatic patients: a background paper [^d90149cd]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

There is great interest in moving beyond established risk factors to consider markers of inflammation for the prediction of initial cardiovascular disease events. Inflammatory markers such as leukocyte count, serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, and vascular outcomes in individuals free of cardiovascular disease at baseline are the key markers that have been investigated in the population setting. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies in asymptomatic individuals compared people in the bottom third of the C-reactive protein distribution with those in the top tertile. The authors reported an odds ratio of 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.5) for coronary heart disease among people in the top tertile. These results are among the strongest assembled thus far to recommend incorporating newer biomarkers into coronary heart disease risk estimation algorithms. A variety of issues should be considered and conditions satisfied before vascular disease risk factors are adopted into regular use. The type of vascular event and the follow-up interval are important features because results for short-, intermediate-, and long-term intervals may yield different results. The factors under consideration should have been standardized, and characteristics such as the variability of the measurements, correlations with established factors, evidence from observational studies and clinical trials, type of effect (linear, nonlinear, dichotomous), improvement in overall prediction (discrimination), generalization of results (calibration), and cost can affect the utility. Each of these issues needs to be considered and the effects on relative, absolute, and population-attributable risks described. In particular, we need to (1) develop sound strategies for implementing new testing and (2) demonstrate the benefit of testing by using the current foundation of prior probabilities developed from already-published risk factor assessments based on large population studies.

### Risk assessment for cardiovascular disease with nontraditional risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^e082212e]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force—nontraditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors: The USPSTF reviewed evidence focusing on ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and found that adding ABI, hsCRP, and CAC to existing CVD risk models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification, but the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown, with limited evidence specific to the Pooled Cohort Equations; the USPSTF also found inadequate evidence that treatment decisions guided by ABI, hsCRP, or CAC reduce incidence of CVD events or mortality and judged the harms of early detection and interventions as small; accordingly, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding ABI, hsCRP, or CAC to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events (I statement).

### C-reactive protein concentration and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality: an individual participant meta-analysis [^aed73218]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Associations of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration with risk of major diseases can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. We assessed the associations of CRP concentration with risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes under different circumstances.

Methods

We meta-analysed individual records of 160 309 people without a history of vascular disease (ie, 1.31 million person-years at risk, 27 769 fatal or non-fatal disease outcomes) from 54 long-term prospective studies. Within-study regression analyses were adjusted for within-person variation in risk factor levels.

Results

Log(e) CRP concentration was linearly associated with several conventional risk factors and inflammatory markers, and nearly log-linearly with the risk of ischaemic vascular disease and non-vascular mortality. Risk ratios (RRs) for coronary heart disease per 1-SD higher log(e) CRP concentration (three-fold higher) were 1.63 (95% CI 1.51-1.76) when initially adjusted for age and sex only, and 1.37 (1.27-1.48) when adjusted further for conventional risk factors; 1.44 (1.32-1.57) and 1.27 (1.15-1.40) for ischaemic stroke; 1.71 (1.53-1.91) and 1.55 (1.37-1.76) for vascular mortality; and 1.55 (1.41-1.69) and 1.54 (1.40-1.68) for non-vascular mortality. RRs were largely unchanged after exclusion of smokers or initial follow-up. After further adjustment for fibrinogen, the corresponding RRs were 1.23 (1.07-1.42) for coronary heart disease; 1.32 (1.18-1.49) for ischaemic stroke; 1.34 (1.18-1.52) for vascular mortality; and 1.34 (1.20-1.50) for non-vascular mortality.

Interpretation

CRP concentration has continuous associations with the risk of coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, vascular mortality, and death from several cancers and lung disease that are each of broadly similar size. The relevance of CRP to such a range of disorders is unclear. Associations with ischaemic vascular disease depend considerably on conventional risk factors and other markers of inflammation.

### Risk assessment for cardiovascular disease with nontraditional risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d3fdbe73]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk assessment—potential harms of testing— Testing for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is described as noninvasive with little direct harm, while harms of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring include exposure to radiation and incidental chest computed tomography findings that may lead to additional procedures. Abnormal test results may lead to further testing, procedures, and lifelong medication use without proof of benefit but with expense and potential adverse effects, and psychological harms may result from reclassification into a higher-risk category for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.

### Implications of C-reactive protein or coronary artery calcium score as an adjunct to global risk assessment for primary prevention of CHD [^f309f97c]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) or coronary artery calcium (CAC) score have been suggested to identify a higher risk subset of intermediate-risk individuals, who potentially could be considered for more aggressive therapy. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we estimated the proportion of intermediate-risk participants whose risk status might change based on additional testing using CRP and/or CAC score.

Methods

Framingham 10-year CHD risk scores (FRS) were calculated and cross tabulations were used to determine the percent of individuals at intermediate-risk by FRS with a CRP >3mg/L and/or CAC score >100 AU. Similar analyses were performed using the gender-specific 75th percentile for CRP and CAC.

Results

Of the 30% of participants (N=1450) classified as intermediate-risk by FRS, 30% had a CRP >3mg/L and 33% had a CAC score >100 AU. Among intermediate-risk women, 49% had a CRP >3mg/L compared to 27% of intermediate-risk men (p<0.0001) while the same percent of intermediate-risk women and men (33%) had a CAC score >100 AU. Eleven percent or less of men or women had both a high CRP and CAC score whether conventional or gender-specific cut points were used. When the percent of intermediate-risk individuals with an elevated CRP and/or CAC score in MESA were applied to NHANES III data, over a million intermediate-risk individuals would move to high risk status if CRP or CAC screening directed treatment strategies were uniformly adopted in the U.S.

Conclusion

There were differences in the number of intermediate-risk individuals reclassified as high risk depending on the screening test used, the cut points selected, and the demographics of the individuals being screened. These data highlight current limitations of broadly using risk markers such as CRP and CAC score in an intermediate-risk population.

### Evaluation of C-reactive protein measurement for assessing the risk and prognosis in ischemic stroke: a statement for health care professionals from the CRP pooling project members [^ea7fd7c7]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Several studies have shown, in different populations, that modest elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in the range seen in apparently healthy individuals is a strong predictor of future vascular events. Elevated plasma CRP concentrations are also associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events and an increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke patients. These epidemiological and clinical observations suggest that determination of plasma CRP concentrations could be used as an adjunct for risk assessment in primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease and be of prognostic value. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for CRP as an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events in at-risk individuals and ischemic stroke patients and to consider its usefulness in evaluating prognosis after stroke.

Summary Of Review

CRP fulfils most of the requirements of a new risk and prognostic predictor, but several issues await further confirmation and clarification before this marker can be included in the routine evaluation of stroke patients and subjects at risk for cerebrovascular disease. Potentially important associations have been established between elevated plasma CRP concentrations and increased efficacy of established therapies, particularly lipid-lowering therapy with statins.

Conclusions

At present, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend measurement of CRP in the routine evaluation of cerebrovascular disease risk in primary prevention, because there is insufficient evidence as to whether early detection, or intervention based on detection, improves health outcomes, although shared risk of cardiovascular disease indicates this may be of value. In secondary prevention of stroke, elevated CRP adds to existing prognostic markers, but it remains to be established whether specific therapeutic options can be derived from this.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^c1390c81]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Subclinical Inflammation in the Current Era of ASCVD Risk Assessment in Primary Prevention

The current trend in primary prevention is to assess individual short‐term (ie, 10‐year) ASCVD risk using scores that incorporate clinical variables and cholesterol measurements. 17, 18, 22, 23 Because of the significant role of inflammation in atherogenesis, efforts were made to assess the utility of markers of subclinical inflammation, such as hsCRP, to improve risk assessment when considered in addition to traditional risk assessment tools. 24, 25, 26, 27 The most recent Multi‐Society American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology cholesterol treatment guideline published in 2018 28 gives a class IIb recommendation for using moderate‐intensity statin therapy in borderline risk (PCE score 5 to <7.5%) individuals with an hsCRP level ≥2 mg/L, considered as an ASCVD risk enhancer. In addition, the latest ESC guideline states that inflammation modifies the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation risk but does not provide specific guidance to hsCRP targets or treatment strategies in patients with heightened inflammation.

We performed discordance analyses to approach the prognostic value of inflammation in primary prevention from a different angle. In our study, 1 in 2 individuals from ARIC had discordance between ≥1 atherogenic lipid measures and hsCRP, with associated increased ASCVD risk in fully adjusted models, which strengthens the evidence that hsCRP can provide additional risk‐modifying information in primary prevention beyond all lipid levels. This increased risk attributed to hsCRP remained consistent across categories of estimated risk by the PCE (P ‐interaction >0.05). Notably, individuals with hsCRP ≥2 mg/L compared with <2 mg/L had a 68% increased risk of ASCVD among individuals categorized as low risk by PCE (score <7.5%). Our findings add to the evidence that anti‐inflammatory lifestyle and pharmacotherapeutic approaches may be considered in a precision‐risk–based approach in individuals with elevated hsCRP. 29 A recent study from MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) showed that moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity was associated with a more favorable profile of inflammatory markers, possible attributable to reduction in central adiposity. 30 Similarly, dietary regimens such as the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve markers of inflammation. 31 In individuals with elevated hsCRP, reducing the lifelong burden of inflammation (a term we call inflammation pack‐years) using lifestyle interventions or anti‐inflammatory pharmacotherapies, such as high‐intensity statin therapy, should be a cornerstone of primordial and primary prevention.

Intermediate-risk coronary heart disease (CHD) risk stratification—hs-CRP, coronary artery calcium (CAC), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and ankle–brachial index (ABI): A reviewed report concluded that the current evidence does not support the routine use of any of the 9 risk factors for further risk stratification of intermediate-risk persons, listing hs-CRP, CAC score, lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, leukocyte count, fasting blood glucose, periodontal disease, ABI, and CIMT. Across markers, hs-CRP, CAC, CIMT, and ABI were associated with CHD and led to some reclassification, but the size and value of reclassification were uncertain, with little evidence regarding discrimination, calibration, and cost-effectiveness; standardization of CIMT measurement was noted as a major challenge, and for ABI evidence suggested some improvement in discrimination but little evidence for calibration and cost-effectiveness.

### CDC / AHA workshop on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease: application to clinical and public health practice: laboratory tests available to assess inflammation – performance and standardization: a background paper [^18a945fe]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. A number of different biomarkers of inflammation are measurable in blood. These include cytokines, chemokines, soluble adhesion molecules, and acute-phase reactants. The first 3 groups of molecules are not routinely measured in clinical laboratories. The acute-phase reactants include C-reactive protein (CRP). This analyte is stable and is readily measured by several commercial high-sensitivity (hs) assays, and numerous clinical studies have demonstrated its usefulness as an atherosclerotic risk marker. For these reasons, CRP is currently the inflammatory marker of choice. Comparison of commercial hsCRP assays has demonstrated that many are capable of imprecision of <7% at a CRP concentration of <1 mg/L. Method comparability studies have shown good agreement among some commercial hsCRP assays in terms of quartile assignments, whereas additional standardization efforts are necessary for others. The first goal of standardization is to develop a secondary reference material with a CRP of approximately 4 mg/L. This material can be used to assist diagnostic vendors in calibrator value assignment and assay harmonization. Another project is to define clearly what performance characteristics are necessary for hsCRP assays. Preliminary estimates based on the biological variability of CRP indicate that the total allowable analytical error is between 15% and 32%. The former requirement can be met with accuracy and imprecision of <5% and the latter requirement with accuracy and imprecision of <11%. If 2 hsCRP results are averaged, then the imprecision requirements are relaxed slightly. Clinical validation of these performance requirements is also required.

Research needs and gaps—nontraditional risk factor assessment—emphasize that additional association studies are unlikely to add more information, and that good-quality studies comparing traditional risk assessment with traditional risk assessment plus the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC scores are needed to measure effects on clinical decision thresholds and patient outcomes (cardiovascular events and mortality).

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation—nontraditional risk factors in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, or coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events; this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score test results, when added to existing CVD risk assessment models, lead to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality, and found adequate evidence to bound the harms of risk assessment and intervention; harms can include abnormal test results, inappropriate risk reclassification, and incidental findings leading to additional testing and possible procedures, as well as anxiety.

### Prognostic impact of admission high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in acute myocardial infarction patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^a9ff7640]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common comorbidity in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and it is associated with two-fold higher in-hospital and long-term mortality rates and with a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Both DM and atherosclerosis are multifactorial conditions, which share a common inflammatory basis. Indeed, on the one hand, DM is an independent risk factor for AMI and is considered a state of low-grade inflammation. On the other hand, inflammation plays a critical role in all phases of coronary athero-thrombosis, including plaque progression, rupture, and thrombosis leading to AMI.

C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein secreted by the liver, is the most widely used biomarker for detecting inflammatory conditions. The elevation of CRP levels frequently occurs in AMI, and it has been associated with adverse outcomes, including higher risk of major adverse cardiac events, cardiovascular death, chronic kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, and all-cause mortality. To assess cardiovascular risk, physicians have now adopted high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), instead of standard CRP assays that monitor infections and other inflammatory conditions. In particular, in the AMI setting, hs-CRP demonstrated to be a more reliable indicator of outcome than CRP measured through traditional assays, showing that even a mild increase (≥ 2 mg/L) is of prognostic relevance.

Elevated hs-CRP levels in AMI patients may reflect a variable combination of chronic and acute (due to the ongoing cardiac event) inflammation. Since DM is more frequently associated with some degree of chronic inflammation, it is possible that, in AMI patients with DM, hs-CRP has a different prognostic relevance as compared to their non-DM counterpart.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between hs-CRP levels, measured at hospital admission, and in-hospital outcome and two-year mortality in a cohort of AMI patients according to DM status.

### Association between C reactive protein and coronary heart disease: mendelian randomisation analysis based on individual participant data [^c1a4521c]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Persistent inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease, but causality has not been established for any specific inflammatory mediator.C reactive protein, an acute phase protein produced by the liver, is the most extensively studied systemic marker of inflammation.Observational epidemiological studies have shown that C reactive protein concentration is log linearly related to risk of subsequent coronary heart disease, though this association depends considerably on levels of conventional risk factors.C reactive protein binds to low density lipoproteinsand is present in atherosclerotic plaques.There is, therefore, interest in whether long term average (“usual”) concentration of C reactive protein is itself causally relevant to coronary heart disease.Randomised trials of interventions specific to C reactive protein, however, have not yet been done in relation to vascular disease outcomes.

In the absence of such trials, focused genetic studies can be used to help judge causality. This approach is known as “mendelian randomisation” because it is based on Mendel’s second law, which states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation. Consequently, mendelian randomisation analyses are based on Mendel’s observation that inheritance of one trait should be independent of inheritance of other traits.For the causal assessment of C reactive protein, a mendelian randomisation analysis should reduce confounding, provided the genetic variants used as proxies for concentration of C reactive protein are unrelated to conventional vascular risk factors and other disease markers. Such studies should also avoid distortions caused by factors occurring later in life (such as the onset of disease) because genetic variants are fixed at conception.Hence, mendelian randomisation analyses should confer certain design advantages akin to those in randomised trials. When applied to other risk factors in coronary heart disease, this approach has previously confirmed the causal relevance of low density lipoprotein cholesterol,increased the likelihood of causality for Lp(a) lipoprotein,and reduced the likelihood of causality for fibrinogen.

Findings from previous human genetic studies have reduced the likelihood of a major causal role for C reactive protein concentration in coronary heart disease.As most known genetic variants related to C reactive protein account for a relatively small portion of the variability in its concentration, however, even larger and more detailed analyses are needed to reliably assess the possibility of any moderate causal role. We report such an analysis based on individual data from 194 418 participants in 47 epidemiological studies. We studied these genetic variants in relation to C reactive protein concentration, other risk factors, and risk of coronary heart disease.

### Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in adults with congenital heart disease [^c7d0c8ba]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are a growing patient population with a high healthcare utilisation.Despite the increased survival prospects, patients with ACHD carry an increased risk of heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, reinterventions and early demise.Although mechanisms such as chronic pressure or volume overload that can lead to cardiac deterioration are well described in patients with ACHD,the potential role of chronic inflammation has been investigated to a lesser extent. A recent study by Opotowsky et al demonstrated that higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with ACHD.These findings suggest that chronic inflammation may contribute to the pathophysiology of deterioration in ACHD, as hs-CRP is a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation.

Currently, it is unknown how hs-CRP relates to other biomarkers and echocardiographic measures in ACHD. Besides the great interest in the pathophysiological mechanism of hs-CRP, the additive prognostic value of hs-CRP beyond conventional biomarkers, such as N-terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin-T (hs-TnT), has not yet been assessed. It is therefore unclear how hs-CRP could enhance risk stratification. Moreover, it is unknown how hs-CRP evolves over time. Studying these temporal patterns may contribute to better understanding of hs-CRP release in patients with ACHD.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of hs-CRP with other biomarkers and echocardiographic measurements, as well as its association with long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ACHD. Moreover, we studied the temporal evolution of hs-CRP and the relation of these evolutions with the risk of cardiovascular events.

### Association of C-reactive protein with cardiovascular disease mortality according to diabetes status: pooled analyses of 25, 979 participants from four U.K. prospective cohort studies [^e32bcd0f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

With classic risk factors failing to fully explain the variance in cardiovascular disease (CVD), investigators have sought to identify new risk indices (–). This effort has implicated several biomarkers, potentially reflecting different metabolic pathways, in the etiology of CVD. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, is one of the most well-documented emerging CVD risk factors. Concentrations of CRP in the upper part of the distribution within the normal range and above are associated with the long-term risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in different populations.

There is a suggestion that the association of CRP with CVD is modified by diabetes status ; however, few such studies exist. In the present population-based cohort studies among individuals with and without diabetes, we investigated the associations of baseline plasma CRP levels with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. In doing so, we also took the opportunity to investigate whether these associations were modified by sex and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, we examined whether the knowledge of CRP can improve CVD risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors alone.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^843c819b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Role of biomarkers in patients with diabetes

The assessment of the utility of risk biomarkers involves several statistical tests beyond the statistical association. Indeed, the presence of a statistically significant association between a risk marker and the disease is mandatory, but does not guarantee the improvement in risk prediction. Recent literature has proposed the use of measures of discrimination and calibration to test the prediction capacity of a risk marker. Discrimination is the capacity to identificate the subject who will present the event of interest from the one who will not. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a popular metric of discrimination. The AUC represents the area under the plot of sensitivity (true positive rate) versus one minus specificity (true negative rate), and means the probability that a given test or predictive model assigns a higher probability of an event to those who actually develop the event. Due to the poor performance of various risk markers on their ability to increase the AUC, researchers have also tested other approaches to analyse the predictive utility of a marker, such as the reclassification. The reclassification evaluates the capacity of a new test when added to a model, to properly reassign a subject to a higher or lower category of risk. Calibration is another statistical method to test the predictive capacity of a marker and represents a measure of how close the predictive risks by a certain model are of the real risks, after dividing the population into categories, such as deciles.

High sensitivity C-reactive protein

High sensitivity C-reative protein (hs-CRP) is a marker of systemic inflammation and a predictor of incident CVD and CHD, independent of diabetes. In the study by Ridker et al. 27,939 presumed healthy American women were followed up for a mean of 8 years for incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization or death from cardiovascular causes. They observed that hs-CRP was strongly related to the incidence of cardiovascular events, even after adjustments for age, smoking status, diabetes, categorical levels of blood pressure and the use of hormone therapy. In that study, hs-CRP performed better than LDL-c, indicating that hs-CRP may add substantial prognostic information to that conveyed by the Framingham risk score. The MESA study, confirmed that hs-CRP is independently associated with incident CHD, adding information to traditional risk factors of Framingham risk score.

### Association between C-reactive protein to albumin ratio and subclinical myocardial injury in the general population free from cardiovascular disease [^7ead7f1f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have investigated the predictive value of CAR for various cardiovascular outcomes. However, our study uniquely contributes to the existing literature by specifically focusing on the relationship between CAR and SC-MI in a population free from clinically apparent CVD. These studies primarily examine the relationship between CAR and clinical outcomes in patients with established cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Our study extends this knowledge by exploring the potential of CAR as a marker for early myocardial injury in a generally healthy population, which has significant implications for early intervention and prevention strategies. Furthermore, our findings offer new perspectives on its specific association with subclinical forms of myocardial injury. The consistency of our findings with these studies supports the hypothesis that inflammation plays a crucial role in the early stages of myocardial injury. Nevertheless, when examining the strength of associations and the particular subgroups impacted, some inconsistencies may occur, possibly due to variations in study populations, research methods, or the definitions used for cardiovascular outcomes.

The biological mechanisms of the observed association between CAR and SC-MI can be attributed to the roles of CRP and albumin in the inflammatory and nutritional pathways. CRP, an acute-phase protein, increases in response to inflammation, which is a known risk factor for myocardial damage. Albumin, on the other hand, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A high CAR may reflect a state of heightened inflammation and oxidative stress coupled with a reduced anti-inflammatory reserve, creating conditions that may lead to subclinical damage to the heart muscle. These mechanisms are critical in understanding the potential progression from subclinical injury to cardiovascular disease.

The implications of our findings are twofold. In clinical practice, measuring CAR could enhance the stratification of risk for SC-MI, potentially guiding early interventions in high-risk individuals. This could be particularly useful in primary prevention settings, where identifying subclinical disease may allow for the implementation of targeted strategies to prevent progression to clinical heart disease. From a public health perspective, the findings highlight the significance of including inflammatory markers like CAR in screening protocols to improve cardiovascular risk assessment. However, caution is necessary when interpreting and utilizing CAR due to its association with various confounders and the need for further validation in diverse populations.

### Pretenders and contenders: inflammation, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 [^e2eadc97]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The initiation of atherosclerosis and its progression to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are intricate processes with many factors, but one central factor is inflammation. Interleukin‐6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that may have a role in the initiation, progression, and vulnerability of atherosclerotic lesions. Interleukin‐6 works upstream of CRP (C‐reactive protein) and downstream of interleukin‐1β and triggers its proinflammatory response via activation of membrane‐bound interleukin‐6 receptors on the cell surface. Epidemiologic studies and large meta‐analyses have found an association between both interleukin‐6 and CRP levels and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) among apparently healthy men 1 and women. 2, 3, 4 An association between both markers and increased mortality has also been described in patients with unstable coronary disease. 5, 6, 7

Although the association between CHD and both CRP and, to a lesser extent, interleukin‐6 is well documented, establishing a direct causative role for these inflammatory cytokines is more challenging. Two large Mendelian randomization analyses implicated the interleukin‐6 pathway as potentially causative in CHD. 8, 9 In these studies, genetic polymorphisms leading to increased levels of the soluble interleukin‐6 receptor were associated with a decreased risk of CHD. Together, these studies suggested interleukin‐6 and interleukin‐6 receptor may be reasonable targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing CHD. On the other hand, Mendelian randomization studies have to date not found evidence of a link between genes related to CRP and CHD outcomes. 10, 11

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein: a novel cardiovascular risk predictor in type 2 diabetics with normal lipid profile [^13a21bb5]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2011). Low credibility.

Background

India is the diabetic capital of the world. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis are complex diseases sharing common antecedents like inflammation. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an acute phase reactant protein, is a proinflammatory atherogenic circulating marker which can prove to be an independent cardiac risk predictor.

Aim

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of hs-CRP as an independent cardiovascular risk marker among Indians with type 2 diabetes with normal lipid profile.

Settings and Design

This was a case control study including 60 type 2 diabetics with normal lipid profile and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

Materials and Methods

Twelve-hour fasting blood samples were collected from all the participants. Serum was assayed for hs-CRP and lipid profile.

Statistical Analysis

Results were analyzed by unpaired t test.

Results

We found elevated hs-CRP levels (4.8 ± 0.2, P < .0001) among cases compared to controls (0.9 ± 0.1). According to hs-CRP levels, seven cases were in the low-risk (< 1 mg/l), 32 in the moderate-risk (1-3 mg/l), and 21 in the high-risk (3-10 mg/l) group with mean values of hs-CRP of 0.7 ± 0.2, 1.75 ± 0.7, and 5.8 ± 1.4, respectively. Relative risk was 4.75 with odds ratio of 10.23 (95% confidence interval 8.8-11.23).

Conclusion

The study suggests that hs-CRP is an independent cardiac risk predictor even with normal lipid profile and can help measure additional risk. The American Heart Association stated that patients in the intermediate- and high-risk group may benefit from therapeutic lifestyle change and that cardiovascular event may be prevented.

### Update on the NCEP ATP-III emerging cardiometabolic risk factors [^227fa3a5]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pro-inflammatory factors

Inflammation has been known to be a critical process in the long-term progression of atherosclerosis for some time. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant that has been used as a marker of systemic inflammation in rheumatologic disorders. Retrospective and prospective studies have found that high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) elevations are associated with acute CVD events. Ridker et al. found that men participating in the Physicians’ Health Study who had hsCRP levels in the highest quartile had a relative risk of 2.9 for MI and 1.9 for ischemic stroke compared to those in the lowest quartile. Furthermore, they found that aspirin was associated with significant reductions in the risk of MI in those with the highest hsCRP levels. Ridker et al. also found that hsCRP was a strong predictor of CVD events in women participating in the Women’s Health Study and that hsCRP may be a stronger predictor of CVD events than LDL-C levels. Furthermore, recent meta-analyses have found that hsCRP is associated with risk for CVD events and mortality. There also appears to be a relationship between hsCRP and LDL-C lowering. In the PROVE IT Study, hsCRP lowering with statin therapy was associated with reduced CVD events regardless of the LDL-C lowering. In the JUPITER Study, rosuvastatin significantly decreased CVD events in patients with elevated hsCRP (>2 mg/L) and ‘normal’ LDL-C (<130 mg/dL), suggesting the importance of hsCRP as a marker of CVD risk and response to statin therapy. There is little evidence, though, that lowering hsCRP levels prevents CVD events. In light of these findings, the new 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk recommends that, based on expert opinion, measurement hsCRP may be considered as a marker of risk to inform decision making on treatment options. There is evidence, though, to suggest that an anti-inflammatory agent such as methotrexate is associated with reduced CVD events in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis. As such, there are currently trials designed to examine whether anti-inflammatory agents reduce CVD risk by reducing systemic inflammation, such as the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital investigating whether low dose methotrexate reduces CVD outcomes in high risk individuals, which may provide evidence for using inflammatory markers as a treatment target.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^49bfc30c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for JUPITER‐Like Population

The JUPITER trial increased the eligibility of adults for statin therapy in the United States and is the primary evidence behind the most recent guideline recommendations to use a hsCRP level of >2 mg/L as a risk enhancer in intermediate risk patients. 32 However, Mora et al 33 showed that residual risk associated with elevated hsCRP in the JUPITER trial could be explained by a higher number of atherogenic particles other than LDL‐C. Given the well‐described discordance between LDL‐C and other, more robust atherogenic lipid measures (ie, non–HDL‐C or apolipoprotein B), 9 we further refined the JUPITER population by sequentially adding atherogenic lipid cut points of percentile equivalence to LDL‐C 130 mg/dL in order to fully assess the lipid‐independent risk attributed to hsCRP. We found that after ≈18 years of follow‐up (about 10‐fold longer than median JUPITER follow‐up), baseline hsCRP ≥2 mg/L was associated with a 32% to 37% increased risk of ASCVD as compared with hsCRP<2 mg/L among individuals with LDL‐C <130 mg/dL and simultaneously more favorable levels of non–HDL‐C (<160 mg/dL), apolipoprotein B (<102 mg/dL), TC/HDL‐C ratio (<4.4), and HDL‐C (≥50 mg/dL) combined. This increased independent risk was also independent of their global ASCVD risk assessed by the PCE score. We subsequently advanced these concepts by examining whether hsCRP ≥2 mg/L was associated with an increased risk of ASCVD when atherogenic lipid levels were as low as LDL‐C <100 mg/dL, as recommended by some guidelines for high‐risk patients, and percentile equivalent values of non–HDL‐C, apolipoprotein B, and TC/HDL‐C. The results were all consistent, suggesting that we ought to reemphasize the importance of using high‐intensity statin therapy, as recommended by JUPITER, in individuals with hsCRP ≥2 mg/L regardless of their lipid levels or PCE risk score.

But is heightened inflammation, in primary prevention, also associated with other clinical outcomes over a long period of follow‐up? We were able to show that hsCRP is consistently associated with the risk of incident HF and all‐cause death, which suggests the possibility that inflammation reduction might have a broad favorable impact on several clinical outcomes, as proposed by other studies. 25, 34

### Relative prognostic value of cardiac troponin I and C-reactive protein in the general population (from the nord-Tr ø ndelag health [ HUNT ] study) [^7847eb4d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I measured with high-sensitivity assays (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and high-sensitivity troponin I [hs-TnI]) have been associated with risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in the general population. The relative prognostic merits of hs-CRP and hs-TnI, and whether these markers of inflammation and subclinical myocardial injury provide incremental information to established cardiovascular risk prediction models, remain unclear. hs-CRP and hs-TnI were measured in 9,005 participants from the prospective observational Nord-Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study. All study subjects were free from known cardiovascular disease at baseline. During a median follow-up period of 13.9 years, 733 participants reached the composite end point of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or heart failure, or cardiovascular death. In adjusted models, increased hs-TnI concentrations (>10ng/L for women and >12ng/L for men) were associated with the incidence of the composite end point (hazard ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.89 to 4.51]), whereas the risk associated with increased hs-CRP concentrations (>3mg/L for both genders) appeared to be weaker (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.10). The addition of hs-TnI to established cardiovascular risk prediction models led to a net reclassification improvement of 0.35 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.42), superior to that of hs-CRP (0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.28). The prognostic accuracy of hs-TnI, assessed by C-statistics, was significantly greater than that of hs-CRP (0.753, 95% CI 0.735 to 0.772, vs 0.644, 95% CI 0.625 to 0.663). In conclusion, in subjects from the general population without a history of cardiovascular disease, hs-TnI provides prognostic information superior to that provided by hs-CRP and may therefore be a preferred marker for targeted prevention.

### C-reactive protein identifies low-risk metabolically healthy obese persons: the European prospective investigation of cancer-Norfolk prospective population study [^29b2ea65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Long‐Term Risk for CHD

The positive association between CRP levels and the MS and between the MS and CHD have been studied extensively. Previous studies suggest that those with the MS or with elevated levels of CRP have an increased risk of CHD 9, 21 ; however, 2 large recently published meta‐analyses assessing the associations of CRP concentration with risk of vascular outcomes did not include the MS in their subgroup analyses. 2, 3 Our data indicate that metabolically unhealthy persons with elevated CRP levels have a significantly higher risk of future CHD compared with metabolically unhealthy persons with CRP levels <2 mg/dL. Ridker et al previously reported an age‐adjusted HR of 2.3 (95% CI 1.6–3.3) for women with the MS if CRP levels <3 mg/L were present in contrast to the HR of 4.0 (95% CI 3.0–5.4) if CRP levels >3 mg/L were present. 9 Rutter et al similarly observed that CRP independently predicted CHD above the presence of the MS in the Framingham prospective cohort study. 12 We found similar associations for abdominally obese participants with elevated CRP levels showing an increased risk for CHD compared with abdominally obese participants with low CRP levels. Previous studies linking CRP levels to CHD were performed largely in populations with a lower prevalence of obesity than that of the current US population. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 In the 2 largest published studies of CRP and CHD disease, 25, 27 the mean body mass index (in  kg/m 2) of participants ranged from 25 to 26, lower than the recently reported mean of 28.7 in US adults, 33 indicating the clinical need for data regarding CRP in obese populations. The Strong Heart Study examined the relationship between CRP levels and CHD in an obese population with a mean body mass index >30. 34 After multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors, no significant association was observed between elevated CRP levels (>3 mg/L) and CHD events; however, subgroup analyses examining these relationships in obese and nonobese participants were not performed. 32 Similarly, Gupta et al reported that the association between CRP and atherosclerosis is diminished in obese persons aged 30 to 65 years. 35 The role of interleukin 6 was recently corroborated by 3 mendelian‐based association studies. 36, 37, 38 Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with decreased interleukin 6 signaling were found to correlate with lower values of acute‐phase reactants, such as CRP and fibrinogen, with a concomitant proportional reduction in cardiovascular risk. This lower predictive accuracy of CRP in obese participants may be affected by the close correlation between CRP and adiposity. Interleukin 6 is the principle cytokine that stimulates CRP release from the liver, and up to one‐third of circulating interleukin 6 is released from adipose tissue. 39, 40 Despite these data suggesting a weakened association in obese versus nonobese persons, our data showed that obese participants with elevated levels of CRP have a higher risk of future CHD than obese participants with CRP levels <2 mg/dL, suggesting that CRP adds prognostic information for the obese population, although the presence or absence of cardiometabolic risk factors may influence the predictive value of CRP in abdominally obese persons (Figure 2).

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein discordance with atherogenic lipid measures and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in primary prevention: the ARIC study [^ad25a982]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Discordance between hsCRP and atherogenic lipoproteins is prevalent (≥50%). Long‐term elevated hsCRP is associated with increased ASCVD risk, incident HF, and all‐cause death even when all atherogenic lipids and HDL‐C levels are more favorable and regardless of estimated PCE risk score. Future studies are needed to assess the use of hsCRP to identify individuals that might benefit from lifestyle and anti‐inflammatory therapies to mitigate this risk.

### Association between C reactive protein and coronary heart disease: mendelian randomisation analysis based on individual participant data [^b6879812]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Implications for disease aetiology

Using the principle of mendelian randomisation, we used CRP genetic variants as proxies to help judge whether usual C reactive protein concentration is causally relevant to coronary heart disease. Our results indicate that genetically raised concentrations of C reactive protein are unrelated to conventional risk factors and risk of coronary heart disease. Given the power of our study, these results suggest that C reactive protein concentration is unlikely to have even a modest causal role in coronary heart disease. Furthermore, we found no material associations between CRP genetic variants and fibrinogen, interleukin 6, and leucocyte count. Because these results suggest that C reactive protein concentration is unlikely to be causally relevant to these inflammatory markers, the findings imply that analyses of C reactive protein concentration and disease outcomes should adjust for these inflammatory markers (that is, treat them as genuine confounders). Indeed, risk ratios for coronary heart disease with circulating C reactive protein were further weakened when we adjusted for such inflammatory markers. This finding further decreases the likelihood that C reactive protein concentration is causally relevant.Collectively, therefore, our results suggest that studies seeking to test the inflammation hypothesis in coronary heart disease should examine inflammatory mediators other than C reactive protein.

Study strengths

Our analysis builds on previous studies, combining several major advantages.Firstly, we carefully selected and assessed specific polymorphisms to capture the full range of common variability in the CRP gene. Variants in the CRP gene related to C reactive protein concentration are more likely to be exclusively associated with C reactive protein concentration than variants in other genes.Secondly, our study involved over 90 000 more participants than the previous largest study, substantially enhancing statistical power. Thirdly, the availability of data from individual participants enabled a comprehensive and detailed range of analyses not possible with aggregated data (such as haplotype analyses and instrumental variables analyses). For example, compared with analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotype analysis allows more complete consideration of genetic variation at a locus. Fourthly, we had information on 94 000 serial measurements, enabling correction of risk ratios for regression dilution biasand yielding results supporting the idea that CRP variants are related to lifetime variation in C reactive protein concentration. Finally, the generalisability of our results is supported by their consistency in 47 studies in 15 countries.

### The effect of including C-reactive protein in cardiovascular risk prediction models for women [^b9769a00]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk, global risk prediction models incorporating hsCRP have not been developed for clinical use.

Objective

To develop and compare global cardiovascular risk prediction models with and without hsCRP.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

U.S. female health professionals.

Participants

Initially healthy nondiabetic women age 45 years and older participating in the Women's Health Study and followed an average of 10 years.

Measurements

Incident cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death).

Results

High-sensitivity CRP made a relative contribution to global risk at least as large as that provided by total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol individually, but less than that provided by age, smoking, and blood pressure. All global measures of fit improved when hsCRP was included, with likelihood-based measures demonstrating strong preference for models that include hsCRP. With use of 10-year risk categories of 0% to less than 5%, 5% to less than 10%, 10% to less than 20%, and 20% or greater, risk prediction was more accurate in models that included hsCRP, particularly for risk between 5% and 20%. Among women initially classified with risks of 5% to less than 10% and 10% to less than 20% according to the Adult Treatment Panel III covariables, 21% and 19%, respectively, were reclassified into more accurate risk categories. Although addition of hsCRP had minimal effect on the c-statistic (a measure of model discrimination) once age, smoking, and blood pressure were accounted for, the effect was nonetheless greater than that of total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol, suggesting that the c-statistic may be insensitive in evaluating risk prediction models.

Limitations

Data were available only for women.

Conclusions

A global risk prediction model that includes hsCRP improves cardiovascular risk classification in women, particularly among those with a 10-year risk of 5% to 20%. In models that include age, blood pressure, and smoking status, hsCRP improves prediction at least as much as do lipid measures.

### C-reactive protein identifies low-risk metabolically healthy obese persons: the European prospective investigation of cancer-Norfolk prospective population study [^480230d0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

C‐reactive protein (CRP) is an acute‐phase protein of the family of the pentraxins and is widely used in clinical settings to monitor chronic and acute inflammatory conditions. 1 The positive association between CRP levels and the risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) has been studied extensively. 2, 3 The metabolic syndrome (MS) represents a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which coexist more often than by chance alone. It is widely accepted that the spectrum of MS includes abdominal obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), and glucose intolerance, although the exact cutoff values are debated. 4, 5 Two large meta‐analyses have shown that the presence of MS raises CHD risk ≈2‐fold. 6, 7 Experimental and observational evidence suggests that inflammation may play a central role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. 8 CRP is associated with all parameters of the MS 9 and has been acknowledged to be an independent but not causal 2, 10 risk factor for incident CHD and to add prognostic value for CHD risk on top of the MS criteria. 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14

The presence of obesity‐related metabolic disturbances varies widely among obese persons. Metabolically healthy obese persons are characterized by having excessive body fat while displaying a favorable metabolic profile characterized by high levels of insulin sensitivity; no hypertension; and a favorable lipid, inflammation, hormonal, liver enzyme, and immune profile. 15 Recent studies have indicated that this healthier metabolic profile may not translate into a lower risk for mortality, 16, 17 whereas other studies suggested that this population might have cardiovascular risk comparable to metabolically healthy nonobese persons. 18, 19 To the best of our knowledge, the role of CRP in the assessment of CHD risk has not been described previously in metabolically healthy obese persons. We set out to determine the associations between CRP levels and the risk of CHD in this group. We tested the following hypotheses: Metabolically healthy obese persons with low levels of CRP (1) have lower cardiovascular risk than metabolically unhealthy obese persons with elevated levels of CRP and (2) have comparable risk of cardiovascular events compared with metabolically healthy nonobese persons. We examined these hypotheses in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer–Norfolk (EPIC‐Norfolk) prospective population study.

### Joint association of TyG index and high sensitivity C-reactive protein with cardiovascular disease: a national cohort study [^88ff6de9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest contributor to global mortality. In China, the prevalence of CVD has doubled since 1990, reaching nearly 94 million in 2016. There is an urgent need to understand the current epidemiological features and risk factors for the major types of CVD and the implications of these features for the primary prevention of CVD. Conventional risk factors in the Framingham risk score (FRS), such as age, cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking, account for most of the risk of CVD and have been used for risk assessment for decades. However, approximately one-third of individuals with fewer risk factors develop CVD, and approximately 40% of individuals with low cholesterol levels die from coronary arterial events in the general population, highlighting the residual CVD risk. Therefore, a wide array of other biomarkers for the refinement of risk assessment of CVD are promising.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^67a737a5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention risk indicators for intensifying atherogenic cholesterol lowering: If further assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is desired to justify more intensive therapy, 1 or more indicators may be considered, including a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score ≥300 Agatston units, which is considered high risk and should encourage optimal statin intensity and goal attainment, and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level ≥2.0 mg/L, which indicates inflammation and supports more intensive non-HDL-C and LDL-C lowering to recommended goals; there are currently no therapies that specifically lower hs-CRP, and it is not recommended to follow hs-CRP levels after atherogenic cholesterol-lowering treatment.

### C-reactive protein, bezafibrate, and recurrent coronary events in patients with chronic coronary heart disease [^d4b885d1]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are related to increased coronary risk in healthy subjects and in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The aims of the present study were to assess the following: (1) the association between CRP and subsequent coronary risk in patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD), (2) the effect of long-term bezafibrate treatment on CRP levels, and (3) to evaluate the consequences of change in CRP level over time on subsequent risk.

Methods

Patients with chronic CHD (n = 3122) were recruited to a secondary prevention study that assessed the efficacy of bezafibrate versus placebo. C-reactive protein was measured in plasma samples collected at prerandomization and after 2 years of follow-up. Mean follow-up time was 6.2 years. Primary end point was fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death.

Results

Increased baseline CRP levels were associated with increased risk (hazard ratios [HRs] per unit of log-transformed CRP level change) of myocardial infarction (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33), the primary end point (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.34), total death (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.40) and cardiac death (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59). After 2 years, CRP levels increased by 3.0% (from a mean level of 3.44 mg/L) in the bezafibrate group and by 3.7% (from 3.49 mg/L) in the placebo group. C-reactive protein levels after 2 years were associated with increased subsequent cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

Baseline CRP and 2-year CRP levels were associated with subsequent risk of myocardial infarction and death in patients with chronic CHD. Bezafibrate did not reduce CRP levels as compared with placebo.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment – from individual risk prediction to estimation of global risk and change in risk in the population [^b664ca38]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Shortcomings of current risk prediction tools

The FRS relies on traditional risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and dyslipidemia. Other risk factors like family history of premature CV disease, obesity, high sensitivity CRP, inflammatory cytokines and lifestyle are not incorporated in present risk formulae. By omitting these risk factors, the current risk prediction formulas may underestimate CV risk in some individuals, particularly those at intermediate CV risk.

Accurate risk equations are often translated into risk tables to facilitate clinical decision making. Tables are used clinically to differentiate between high and low risk patients, allowing the implementation of preventative strategies. Thresholds are often used to categorize continuous variables as normal or abnormal or using different level proportional risk using a points system. By doing so, some prognostic information in extreme values is disregarded despite the linear or near linear association between CV risk factors and CV events. Variables whose incremental risk is proportional or exponential to its level, for instance, with hypertension or elevated LDL, the dichotomization of variables according to a given threshold leads to similar risks being applied to values that barely exceed the threshold with those that are far beyond the threshold. Conversely, values that are slightly below the threshold are often treated as normal, which leads to inaccuracies.

### Inflammation and cardiovascular disease: 2025 ACC scientific statement: a report of the American college of cardiology [^86dc474f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to biomarkers, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that other inflammatory biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and eicosapentaenoic acid-to-arachidonic acid ratio also predict cardiovascular risk; however, routine evaluation of these adds little to hs-CRP, which is the only biomarker recognized by regulatory agencies and consistently used in major cardiovascular outcome trials.

### Utility of inflammatory markers in the management of coronary artery disease [^a3f5b8da]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Certain markers of systemic inflammation are powerful predictors of cardiovascular events. Fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines are among the inflammatory markers associated with various cardiovascular end points. Fibrinogen and CRP both have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality in patients with stable angina. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen also have prognostic value in patients with unstable angina. In addition to prognostic implications, several cardiovascular risk factors (eg, smoking, obesity, diabetes) are associated with high levels of fibrinogen and hs-CRP. Benefits from aspirin are more likely in patients whose hs-CRP levels are very high. Some fibrates decrease fibrinogen levels and hs-CRP. Statin therapy either reduces the CAD risk associated with system inflammation or lowers circulating levels of hs-CRP.

### Elevated serum interleukin-6 is predictive of coronary artery disease in intermediate risk overweight patients referred for coronary angiography [^db7d7015]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of death globally, with an increasing prevalence in the western world. The precision in estimating the risk for future CAD is crucial for treatment decision and prevention strategies. Improving accuracy in risk prediction is especially important among patients at intermediate cardiovascular risk, where calibration is limited when using global risk score calculators. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines currently suggest the use of 10 year ASCVD risk score to estimate the risk for future coronary events and to define strategies of primary prevention. Although this approach is important, the precision in patients at intermediate coronary risk is less accurate than in higher or lower risk categories.

The prevalence of coronary disease in patients who are referred for coronary artery angiography due to chest pain is usually high. However, chest pain can be managed with distinct approaches according to specific assistance protocols in different health care systems. In general, middle-aged non-diabetic individuals who have few cardiovascular risk factors are considered at intermediate-high risk, and the presence of chest pain in these patients poses an important challenge for the health care team. The incidence of false positives for coronary disease tends to be higher in this category than in patients at high-risk. Therefore, the use of emergent biomarkers may help in risk reclassification, being an interesting approach.

There is extensive evidence supporting a role of inflammatory response in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and in the natural history of atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular events are more common in patients with high circulating levels of several inflammatory markers, and treating based on inflammatory parameters, such as hs-C reactive protein (hs-CRP), have been proved to reduce outcomes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), however, is a central mediator of the acute-phase response and a primary determinant of hepatic production of C-reactive protein (CRP). IL-6 is associated with increased incidence of myocardial infarction and mortality among patients with ACS. As hs-CRP has been classically linked to coronary events, it is also reasonable to address the role of IL-6, an even more precocious biomarker of inflammation than hs-CRP, in improving the detection of CAD and the severity of disease in this population.

The present study aimed to analyze the predictive value of IL-6 for diagnosing the presence of early CAD through coronary angiography in intermediate risk patients with chest pain, comparing its performance to hs-CRP. We hypothesized that IL-6 could improve the accuracy of traditional risk scores such as ASCVD and hs-CRP in patients at intermediate risk.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in secondary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the dosage of statin therapy to a higher intensity range in patients with hs-CRP levels > 2 mg/L, regardless of LDL-C levels.

### Rosuvastatin for primary prevention among individuals with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 5% to 10% and 10% to 20% 10-year risk. implications of the justification for use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial for "intermediate risk" [^03dbea97]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent primary prevention guidelines issued in Canada endorse the use of statin therapy among individuals at "intermediate risk" who have elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, trial data directly addressing whether this recommendation defines a patient population in which statin therapy is effective have not previously been published.

Methods and Results

In the Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, which demonstrated a 44% reduction in first vascular events when rosuvastatin 20 mg was compared with placebo among 17 802 primary prevention patients with LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL and hsCRP ≥2 mg/L, 6091 participants (2525 women, 3566 men) had baseline estimated 10-year Framingham risks of 5% to 10% and 7340 participants (1404 women, 5936 men) had baseline estimated Framingham risk of 11% to 20%. In these 2 "intermediate risk" subgroups, relative risk reductions consistent with the overall trial treatment effect were observed (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.84; 5-year number needed to treat=40, P=0.005 for those with 5% to 10% risk; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.68, 5-year number needed to treat=18, P<0.0001 for those with 11% to 20% risk). Use of the Reynolds Risk Score to stratify the study population gave similar results but reclassified large numbers of individuals into lower- or higher-risk groups. The majority of women with elevated hsCRP who benefited from rosuvastatin were at 5% to 10% 10-year risk at study entry using either global risk scoring system.

Conclusions

Consistent with recent evidence-based Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for primary prevention, the JUPITER trial demonstrates that rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduces major cardiovascular events among men and women with elevated hsCRP and "intermediate risk" defined either as 5% to 10% or 10% to 20% 10-year risk.
