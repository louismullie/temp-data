## Question

What nonpharmacologic therapies improve fibromyalgia outcomes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which nonpharmacologic therapies improve fibromyalgia outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether guidelines consistently position nonpharmacologic care as first-line. Then, I should verify which modalities have the most robust evidence and where the effect sizes and certainty stand. Next, I'll need to examine exercise, CBT, multicomponent programs, and mind-body therapies individually. After that, I will consider complementary approaches like acupuncture, massage, and hydrotherapy, and I must check safety profiles. Finally, I should integrate sleep-focused considerations, implementation strategies, and synthesize a prioritized, clinically pragmatic ranking while acknowledging limitations in the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: major guidelines converge on nonpharmacologic interventions as first-line for fibromyalgia, emphasizing safer profiles and broad symptom benefits across pain, function, and quality of life, with pharmacologic options reserved as adjuncts tailored to specific symptom clusters [^115MMv8S] [^116bYrwP] [^111mo8hb].

> I will now examine exercise because it typically has the strongest and most consistent evidence across outcomes; EULAR explicitly advises aerobic and strengthening exercise, and contemporary systematic reviews and network meta-analyses show improvements in global impact (FIQ), pain, sleep, mood, and fatigue, particularly for land-based aerobic combined with flexibility or strengthening programs, provided they start below capacity and progress slowly to prevent flares [^115MMv8S] [^115CdrK7] [^114xURFE] [^111mo8hb] [^116NK986].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and certainty of these effects, because some network meta-analysis estimates for sleep quality appear unusually large; the 2025 syntheses indeed report sizable standardized mean differences for land-based aerobic plus flexibility and aquatic aerobic exercise on sleep, but also highlight heterogeneity, high risk of bias in many trials, and low to very low certainty for most non-exercise comparisons, so I should present these as promising but not definitive and emphasize individualized trialing and adherence for durability of benefit [^111zdHCb] [^111Qnwcu] [^114pf2T9].

> Next, I should review cognitive behavioral therapy; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — CBT's benefits extend beyond pain to coping, self-efficacy, and mood, with Cochrane evidence across 23 RCTs and multi-guideline endorsement, and CBT for insomnia has additional analgesic signal, so CBT remains a core nonpharmacologic pillar alongside exercise [^1154RY38] [^111Lw2Wh] [^116PskqX] [^116tioBL].

> Let me consider multicomponent or multidisciplinary programs; EULAR recommends considering them and Canadian guidelines encourage offering them to build coping and self-management, and network analyses suggest meaningful FIQ improvements, consistent with the idea that combining exercise plus psychological interventions yields additive benefits for global outcomes [^114x14ok] [^112MfhoB] [^115iY79t].

> I need to check mind-body and mindfulness-based approaches; yoga and MBSR are recommended or offered in primary care guidance, EULAR considers tai chi and qigong, Cochrane reviews report benefits over attention/wait-list, and recent analyses show improvements in mental and physical health composites, though effect sizes vary and quality is mixed — so these are reasonable adjuncts, especially when acceptability is high [^112VM8yn] [^113PTUdL] [^1152ZNEf] [^116g3b1q].

> Hold on, I should verify complementary therapies such as acupuncture and massage/myofascial release; AAFP suggests considering them for small to moderate nonpain benefits, EULAR lists them among complementary options to consider, yet the Canadian guideline judged evidence insufficient for broad CAM endorsement — so I will present them as conditional, patient-preference–driven options with modest expected gains rather than core therapies [^116bYrwP] [^113Usw6u] [^113PTUdL] [^111hyKzt] [^111QmnFw].

> Let me now examine hydrotherapy and pool-based exercise; eight RCTs indicate comparable efficacy to land-based exercise with potential advantages for sleep and mood and better initial tolerability in those with weight-bearing joint pain or exercise fear-avoidance, which aligns with separate network findings that aquatic aerobic exercise can improve sleep quality [^114mi8qz] [^111zdHCb] [^114xURFE].

> But wait, what if sleep is a primary target; I should confirm the sleep–pain link in fibromyalgia and the role of sleep-focused therapies; sleep dysfunction contributes to pain amplification via impaired descending inhibition, and trials suggest that improving sleep, particularly with CBT for insomnia, can modestly reduce pain, while exercise modalities also show sleep benefits — so prioritizing sleep hygiene and CBT-I within a multimodal plan is clinically sound [^115DGEgt] [^116tioBL] [^111zdHCb].

> I need to ensure the safety profile is clear; across randomized trials, nonpharmacologic interventions are generally well tolerated with mostly mild, transient stiffness or fatigue reported, whereas pharmacologic options more often produce dizziness, somnolence, headache, or dry mouth, supporting the guideline preference for nonpharmacologic first-line strategies [^114UkFeL] [^1121wr14] [^116bYrwP].

> Next, I should review implementation principles; guidelines emphasize education, self-management, pacing, and graded activity, choosing modalities aligned to the patient's most bothersome symptoms, and combining exercise with psychological strategies to enhance adherence and durability, while tailoring to comorbidities and functional goals such as work participation when relevant [^111mo8hb] [^1165Hkuy] [^117BAsps] [^116zR2up].

> Hmm, wait a minute, are there other nonpharmacologic modalities worth flagging; TENS and low-level laser have emerging or mixed evidence with small studies and variable quality, so I should avoid over-weighting them and present them as optional trials when access and patient interest align, recognizing the current limitations and the need for larger, higher-quality RCTs [^114TfEL5] [^114QoVFH].

> Let me reconsider the overall prioritization to avoid overstatement; although hyperbaric oxygen occasionally ranks highly in network analyses, the estimates derive from very small samples and indirect evidence, so I should not treat it as standard care and instead reaffirm the core sequence of exercise, CBT, and multicomponent programs, followed by mind-body modalities and conditional complementary therapies, all within a patient-centered, stepwise plan [^1121wr14] [^115iY79t] [^11751wpH].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the final synthesis is clinically actionable: first-line should be individualized, graded exercise as the anchor; parallel or sequential CBT (including CBT-I when sleep drives pain/fatigue) as a second anchor; consider multicomponent rehabilitation when available to integrate education, self-management, and pacing; add mind-body practices such as yoga, tai chi, MBSR for quality-of-life and coping; and selectively trial acupuncture, massage, or pool-based programs for symptom relief and tolerability, with ongoing monitoring and adjustment based on patient-reported function and sleep quality, acknowledging heterogeneity and generally low-to-moderate certainty for many comparisons [^115MMv8S] [^1154RY38] [^114x14ok] [^112VM8yn] [^113Usw6u] [^114mi8qz] [^1121wr14].

---

Nonpharmacologic therapies are first-line for fibromyalgia, with **aerobic and resistance exercise** and **CBT** providing the most consistent benefits across pain, function, and quality of life [^115MMv8S] [^1154RY38]. Mind-body practices (yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness), acupuncture, and massage offer additional symptom relief and are **recommended by major guidelines** [^113PTUdL] [^112VM8yn] [^113Usw6u] [^116bYrwP]. Multicomponent programs combining exercise, psychological therapy, and education yield **broader, sustained improvements** [^114x14ok] [^112MfhoB]. These interventions are generally safe, with mild, transient adverse effects, and should be individualized to patient preferences and tolerance [^114UkFeL].

---

## Exercise interventions

Exercise is strongly recommended as a first-line therapy for fibromyalgia, with **aerobic and resistance training** showing the most consistent benefits.

- **Aerobic exercise**: Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, cycling, swimming) significantly improves pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and physical function. Aquatic aerobic exercise is particularly beneficial for patients with joint pain or obesity [^115MMv8S] [^114mi8qz].

- **Resistance training**: Progressive resistance training improves muscle strength, physical function, and reduces pain and fatigue. Combining aerobic and resistance training yields additive benefits [^115MMv8S] [^113SSdPi].

- **Flexibility and balance exercises**: While flexibility exercises alone have limited impact on pain, they improve physical function and balance, and are beneficial when combined with aerobic or resistance training [^115MMv8S].

---

## Psychological interventions

Psychological therapies, particularly **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**, are effective for managing fibromyalgia symptoms.

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT significantly reduces pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and psychological distress, and improves quality of life. CBT is recommended as a core component of fibromyalgia management [^1154RY38] [^111dgTXp].

- **Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)**: MBSR and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) improve psychological well-being, reduce stress, and enhance quality of life [^113PTUdL] [^116PskqX].

- **Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)**: ACT improves psychological flexibility, reduces pain-related distress, and enhances quality of life.

---

## Mind-body therapies

Mind-body therapies integrate physical movement, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques and provide **holistic benefits**.

- **Yoga**: Yoga significantly improves pain, fatigue, sleep quality, and psychological well-being. It is recommended by major guidelines [^113PTUdL] [^112VM8yn].

- **Tai chi and qigong**: These meditative movement therapies improve pain, fatigue, sleep, and psychological health, and are recommended by guidelines [^113PTUdL].

- **Mindfulness meditation**: Mindfulness meditation reduces pain catastrophizing, stress, and improves psychological well-being [^113PTUdL].

---

## Complementary and alternative therapies

Several complementary therapies have demonstrated efficacy in fibromyalgia management. Acupuncture provides **small-to-moderate improvements** in pain, fatigue, and sleep quality and is guideline-recommended [^113PTUdL] [^113Usw6u]. Massage therapy offers **short-term relief** of pain, fatigue, and anxiety and is guideline-recommended [^116bYrwP]. Hydrotherapy improves **pain, fatigue, and sleep quality** and is guideline-recommended [^113PTUdL].

---

## Multicomponent and multidisciplinary interventions

Multicomponent interventions combining exercise, psychological therapies, and education provide **comprehensive benefits**. Within multicomponent and multidisciplinary care, **Multidisciplinary rehabilitation** programs significantly improve pain, fatigue, sleep, psychological distress, and quality of life [^114x14ok] [^112MfhoB], while **Self-management education** enhances self-efficacy, coping skills, and overall quality of life [^114WVC4v].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Nonpharmacologic therapies are generally safe and well-tolerated, with **minimal adverse effects**. Mild, transient symptoms such as stiffness or fatigue may occur but are typically self-limited [^114UkFeL].

---

### Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia [^1154RY38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown etiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. Patients often report high disability levels and negative mood. Psychotherapies focus on reducing key symptoms, improving daily functioning, mood, and a sense of personal control over pain.

To assess the benefits and harms of cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) for treating FM at the end of treatment and at long-term (at least six months) follow-up, we conducted a series of searches.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 August 2013), PsycINFO (1966 to 28 August 2013), and SCOPUS (1980 to 28 August 2013). Additionally, we searched http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (website of the US National Institutes of Health) and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials (last search 28 August 2013), and the reference lists of reviewed articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials of CBTs with children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with FM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The data of all included studies were extracted, and the risks of bias of the studies were assessed independently by two review authors. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

The review included twenty-three studies with 24 study arms with CBTs. A total of 2031 patients participated, with 1073 patients in CBT groups.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114pf2T9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

There are several published systematic reviews assessing different forms of exercise training and other nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Although not primarily focused on sleep problems, they all identify similar limitations to those we observed here, including heterogeneity across studies in terms of study protocols, insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of one intervention compared with another, lack of appropriate comparator treatments, insufficient statistical power in most studies, and low-to-moderate quality of the evidence. One systematic review that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia revealed that all types of exercise, except for flexibility exercises, helped reduce pain intensity, whereas aerobic and strengthening exercises helped improve sleep quality. However, the authors identified only a limited number of studies, usually of small sample sizes, for each form of exercise (10 for aerobic exercise, 9 for strengthening, and 2 for flexibility) and found considerable heterogeneity in outcome measures, intervention programs, and control interventions, in line with our findings.

Overall, there is a suggestion that some forms of exercise training, psychological and behavioral therapy, and some pharmacologic treatments may play a role in improving fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems and/or patients' quality of life. However, the limitations of the evidence do not allow reliable conclusions about optimal interventions for treating sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces movement-evoked pain and fatigue: A randomized, controlled trial [^114TfEL5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue. Pharmacologic interventions are only modestly effective for treating FM, with most individuals experiencing activity-limiting pain despite the use of multiple drugs. It has become increasingly recognized that nonpharmacologic interventions should be considered as first-line treatments for chronic pain and as safe, low-cost treatments that can be added to pharmacologic approaches. While there is strong evidence that exercise is an effective treatment for FM, individuals report that movement-evoked pain limits activity participation. Use of nonpharmacologic approaches that reduce movement-evoked pain would theoretically increase activity participation, resulting in a perceived global improvement.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a nonpharmacologic intervention that delivers electrical impulses through the skin for pain control. Animal studies show that TENS activates endogenous inhibitory mechanisms to reduce central excitability. In contrast, individuals with FM exhibit reduced endogenous inhibition and enhanced central excitability. Thus, based on the mechanism of action of TENS, it may be useful in individuals with FM.

Although TENS is effective for several pain conditions, recent systematic reviews have shown mixed results. Limitations of the TENS trials currently described in the literature include inadequate sample size, limited outcome data, and moderate quality of evidence.

### A roadmap for the management of fibromyalgia [^116zR2up]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The patient is at the center of the treatment roadmap for fibromyalgia, which extends beyond the primary care physician to include multidisciplinary experts and community resources. The physician must create a framework in which a full treatment strategy can be articulated with the input of the patient. Physicians need to help patients with fibromyalgia educate themselves about their illness and its treatment and understand that treatment success depends on patients' engagement with all components of the treatment roadmap.

### Relistor [^1179kTnQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

CI = confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; aDifference for active treatment vs. placebo; *A responder is defined as a patient with 3 or more SBMs/week, with an increase of 1 or more SBM/week over baseline, for 3 or more out of the first 4 weeks of the treatment period.

- **Relistor injection**: The efficacy of RELISTOR injection in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 2). This study compared a 4-week treatment of RELISTOR injection 12 mg, administered subcutaneously once daily, with a placebo.

- **Study details**: A total of 312 patients (150 RELISTOR, 162 placebo) were enrolled and treated in the double-blind period. Patients had a history of chronic non-cancer pain for which they were taking opioids. The majority of patients had a primary diagnosis of back pain; other primary diagnoses included joint/extremity pain, fibromyalgia, neurologic/neuropathic pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. Prior to screening, patients had been receiving opioid therapy for pain for 1 month or longer, with a median daily baseline oral morphine equivalent dose of 161 mg, and had OIC (less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week during the screening period). Constipation due to opioid use had to be associated with one or more of the following: a Bristol Stool Form Scale score of 1 or 2 for at least 25% of the bowel movements (BM), straining during at least 25% of the BMs, or a sensation of incomplete evacuation after at least 25% of the BMs.

### Update on fibromyalgia therapy [^117XpCts]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia, a poorly understood chronic pain syndrome, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, psychological distress, and specific regions of localized tenderness, all in the absence of otherwise apparent organic disease. While the etiology of fibromyalgia is unclear, accumulating data suggest that disordered central pain processing likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Although various pharmacological treatments have been studied and espoused for treating fibromyalgia, no single drug or group of drugs has proved to be particularly useful in treating fibromyalgia patients as a whole, and only one drug at the time of writing has earned U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for treating the syndrome in the United States. This review critically and systematically evaluates clinical investigations of medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments for fibromyalgia dating from 1970 to 2007.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain: Nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatments [^111QmnFw]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic low back pain, neck pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia are the most common types of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Because no individual therapy has consistent benefit, a multimodal treatment approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain is recommended. Many nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatment approaches yield small to moderate improvement and can be used with pharmacologic or more invasive modalities. Systematic reviews and guidelines support the effectiveness of various forms of exercise in improving pain and function in patients with chronic pain. Cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness techniques appear to be effective for small to moderate short- and long-term improvement of chronic low back pain. Cognitive behavior therapy may also be effective for small short- and intermediate-term improvement of fibromyalgia.

Spinal manipulation leads to a small benefit for chronic neck and low back pain. Acupuncture has a small to moderate benefit for low back pain and small benefit for nonpain fibromyalgia symptoms. Massage or myofascial release yields a small improvement in low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Low reactive level laser therapy may provide short-term relief of chronic neck and low back pain, and ultrasound may provide short-term pain relief for knee osteoarthritis. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be effective for short- and at least intermediate-term improvement in pain and function for chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. Patients should be encouraged to engage in a variety of therapies aligned with their needs and preferences.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1135s7ds]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a complex, heterogeneous condition that affects 2% to 3% of the global population. In the absence of a cure, a range of treatments is offered to alleviate symptoms. Most people with fibromyalgia complain about sleep problems. Fibromyalgia-related sleep problems are poorly managed, and after an initial diagnosis, people continue to seek help to improve their sleep for many years.

- **Significance and innovations**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia-related sleep problems. A wide range of interventions, especially nonpharmacologic interventions, have been tested in fibromyalgia trials with very low-to-moderate certainty regarding effectiveness. Our results indicate that engaging in some forms of exercise — such as land-based aerobic exercise training in combination with flexibility training and aquatic-based aerobic exercise training — may improve sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia. Certain pharmacologic interventions may also be effective in improving sleep but not without side effects.

The 2015 European guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia considered sleep as a key outcome of interest. Although general recommendations were made for interventions to manage sleep, these were graded as "weak" due to a paucity of published evidence at that time. Additionally, sleep was not the primary focus of the guidelines. Previously published evidence reviews informed the National Institute…

### Nicardipine hydrochloride [^113VKci3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

"Coronary Steal", a detrimental redistribution of coronary blood flow in patients with coronary artery disease, where blood is diverted from underperfused areas toward better-perfused areas, has not been observed during nicardipine treatment. On the contrary, nicardipine has been shown to improve systolic shortening in normal and hypokinetic segments of myocardial muscle. Radionuclide angiography has confirmed that wall motion remained improved during an increase in oxygen demand. Nonetheless, occasional patients have developed increased angina upon receiving nicardipine. It remains unclear whether this represents steal in those patients or is the result of increased heart rate and decreased diastolic pressure.

In patients with coronary artery disease, nicardipine improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase, likely due to a faster rate of myocardial relaxation in previously underperfused areas. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium, suggesting the improvement is mainly through indirect mechanisms such as afterload reduction and reduced ischemia. Nicardipine has no negative effect on myocardial relaxation at therapeutic doses. The clinical consequences of these properties are as yet undemonstrated.

- **Electrophysiologic effects**: In general, no detrimental effects on the cardiac conduction system were observed with the use of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules.

### Management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^116LDQ7D]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

The optimal management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) remains unclear, as comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been reported. This study aims to provide up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS. The data sources, selection, and extraction involved searching all human trials, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of FMS. These sources include the Cochrane Collaboration Reviews (1993–2004), MEDLINE (1966–2004), CINAHL (1982–2004), EMBASE (1988–2004), PubMed (1966–2004), Healthstar (1975–2000), Contents (2000–2004), Web of Science (1980–2004), PsychInfo (1887–2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996–2004). An interdisciplinary panel of 13 experts in various pain management disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), performed the literature review, supplemented by additional literature reviews from APS staff members and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles were reviewed.

Data synthesis highlights significant limitations in the FMS literature, with many treatment trials constrained by short durations and lack of masking. Currently, no medical therapies have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for FMS management. However, evidence suggests the efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education. Several other commonly used FMS therapies, such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately evaluated.

In conclusion, despite the chronicity and complexity of FMS, these findings contribute to understanding the management approaches available for patients.

### Efficacy and safety of gut microbiota-based therapies in autoimmune and rheumatic diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 80 randomized controlled trials [^113pBthQ]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Two RCTs reported on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Roman et al. found that gut microbiota-based therapy did not seem to improve VAS compared with the control group (P > 0.05). Calandre et al. also showed that gut microbiota-based therapy did not improve VAS compared with the control group (P > 0.05).

Two RCTs reported on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Roman et al. found that gut microbiota-based therapy did not seem to improve FIQ compared with the control group (P > 0.05). Calandre et al. also showed that gut microbiota-based therapy did not improve FIQ compared with the control group (P > 0.05).

- **Adverse events of gut microbiota-based therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome**: Only Calandre et al. reported adverse events. They noted that seven patients in the experimental group and six patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The vast majority of adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal tract, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. More RCTs are needed in the future to determine the occurrence of adverse events.

- **Gut microbiota-based therapies for primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS)**: Only one RCT reported gut microbiota-based therapies for PSS. Kamal et al. treated patients with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum for 5 weeks. They found a significant reduction in candida burden from baseline to week 5 in the probiotic group, while the placebo group had no statistically significant change in concomitant candida burden.

### Lyrica [^116WgabG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

This randomized withdrawal study compared Lyrica with placebo. Patients were titrated during a 6-week open-label dose optimization phase to a total daily dose of 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg. Patients were considered to be responders if they had both at least a 50% reduction in pain (VAS) and rated their overall improvement on the PGIC as "much improved" or "very much improved".

Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind treatment phase to either the dose achieved in the open-label phase or to placebo. Patients were treated for up to 6 months following randomization. Efficacy was assessed by time to loss of therapeutic response, defined as less than a 30% reduction in pain (VAS) from the open-label baseline during two consecutive visits of the double-blind phase, or worsening of FM symptoms necessitating an alternative treatment.

Fifty-four percent of patients were able to titrate to an effective and tolerable dose of Lyrica during the 6-week open-label phase. Of the patients entering the randomized treatment phase assigned to remain on Lyrica, 38% completed 26 weeks of treatment versus 19% of placebo-treated patients.

When considering the return of pain or withdrawal due to adverse events as loss of response (LTR), treatment with Lyrica resulted in a longer time to loss of therapeutic response than treatment with placebo. Fifty-three percent of the pregabalin-treated subjects compared to 33% of placebo patients remained on the study drug and maintained a therapeutic response to Week 26 of the study.

### Effects of psychological stress on adverse pregnancy outcomes and nonpharmacologic approaches for reduction: An expert review [^111NENfX]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Low credibility.

Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes, floods) and other global phenomena (e.g. the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy.

This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy. It examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes.

### Calcipotriene [^111wcqpT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adequate and well-controlled trials of patients treated with calcipotriene cream have demonstrated improvement usually beginning after 2 weeks of therapy. This improvement continued with approximately 50% of patients showing at least marked improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriasis after 8 weeks of therapy, but only approximately 4% showed complete clearing.

### Low-level laser therapy for fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QoVFH]. Pain physician (2019). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread pain and tenderness. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT), an emerging nonpharmacological treatment, has been used for relieving musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain.

The objective of this review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of LLLT on patients with fibromyalgia. This study involved a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It examined all RCTs evaluating the effect of LLLT on fibromyalgia.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the effect of LLLT on patients with fibromyalgia. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published before August 2018. RCTs meeting our selection criteria were included. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated according to the Cochrane risk-for-bias method. Review Manager version 5.3 was used to perform the meta-analysis.

- **Primary outcomes**: The total scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), pain severity, and number of tender points.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Changes in fatigue, stiffness, anxiety, and depression.

Standardized mean differences (SMD), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P values were calculated for outcome analysis. We identified nine RCTs that included 325 fibromyalgia patients undergoing LLLT or placebo laser treatment with or without an exercise program. The meta-analysis showed that patients receiving LLLT demonstrated significantly greater improvements in these outcomes.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^1165Hkuy]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of fibromyalgia, specifically concerning general principles, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend tailoring pharmacotherapy by targeting the most bothersome symptoms. Ideally, management should address multiple symptoms simultaneously, which may require a combination of medications. In such cases, careful attention must be paid to potential drug interactions.

### Analgesic benefits of pharmacological and nonpharmacological sleep interventions for adults with fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analyses [^116tioBL]. Pain (2025).

Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain condition affecting 2% to 8% of the population. Most people with fibromyalgia experience poor sleep, and sleep problems consistently predict pain severity. Given the bidirectional relationship between sleep and pain, improving sleep may reduce fibromyalgia pain. This review identified trials of sleep-focused pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to evaluate whether they improved pain outcomes for adults with fibromyalgia. A systematic search of 7 electronic databases, 2 trial registries, and the reference lists of related studies retrieved 5728 records. Three independent reviewers completed study screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria.

Sleep interventions were evaluated against inactive and active control groups in a total of 10 trials with self-reported pain outcomes. Sodium oxybate significantly improved pain compared with placebo (4.5 g: MD = -9.55, 95% CI [-11.97, -7.12]; 6.0 g: SMD = -3.41, 95% CI [-6.49, -0.32]) at postintervention. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia also significantly improved pain compared with usual care (MD = -5.47, 95% CI [-9.64, -1.30]) at postintervention. Comparisons of CBT for insomnia with sleep hygiene training, and combined CBT for insomnia and pain with CBT for pain showed no significant postintervention differences. Other interventions (e.g. melatonin and zopiclone) were identified but had insufficient data to allow meta-analysis. This review provided preliminary support for the analgesic benefits of sleep interventions in fibromyalgia, although more evidence is needed to draw firm conclusions.

### Effectiveness of exercise in management of fibromyalgia [^116NK986]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Exercise was established as an integral part of the nonpharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia approximately 20 years ago. Since then, many studies have investigated the effects of exercise, either alone or in combination with other interventions. This review discusses the benefits of exercise alone and provides practical suggestions on how patients can exercise without causing a long-term exacerbation of their pain.

- **Recent findings**: Short-term exercise programs for individuals with fibromyalgia have consistently improved physical function, especially physical fitness, and reduced tender point pain. Exercise has also produced improvements in self-efficacy. These effects can persist for periods of up to two years but may require participants to continue to engage in exercise. Most exercise studies have examined the effects of moderately intense aerobic exercise. Only in the past two years have muscle-strengthening programs, in isolation, been evaluated. To be well tolerated, exercise programs must start at a level just below the capacity of the participants and then progress slowly. Even with these precautions, exercise may still produce tolerable, short-term increases in pain and fatigue that should abate within the first few weeks of exercising.

- **Summary**: Future studies should investigate the possible benefits of low-intensity exercise and test strategies that may enhance long-term compliance with exercise. Individuals with fibromyalgia also need to be able to access community exercise programs that are appropriate for them. This may require community instructors to develop suitable programs.

### Milnacipran HCl [^112J6sLf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The exact mechanism of the central pain inhibitory action of milnacipran and its ability to improve the symptoms of fibromyalgia in humans are unknown. Preclinical studies have shown that milnacipran is a potent inhibitor of neuronal norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake; milnacipran inhibits norepinephrine uptake with approximately 3-fold higher potency in vitro than serotonin without directly affecting the uptake of dopamine or other neurotransmitters. Milnacipran has no significant affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1–7), α- and β-adrenergic, muscarinic (M1–5), histamine (H1–4), dopamine (D1–5), opiate, benzodiazepine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro. Pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs.

Milnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Cl– channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase.

- **Pharmacodynamics: Cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of milnacipran hydrochloride on the QTcF interval was measured in a double-blind, placebo-and positive-controlled parallel study in 88 healthy subjects using 600 mg/day milnacipran hydrochloride (3 to 6 times the recommended therapeutic dose for fibromyalgia). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 8 ms (2-sided 90% CI, 3 to 12 ms). This increase is not considered to be clinically significant.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111zdHCb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The network meta-analysis results for the interventions versus placebo or sham demonstrate a beneficial effect on sleep quality from aquatic‐based aerobic exercise training (n = 59; SMD −2.63, 95% CrI −4.74 to −0.58) and land‐based aerobic exercise training combined with flexibility exercise training (n = 32; SMD −4.69, 95% CrI −8.14 to −1.28). There is also a suggestion of a modest effect on sleep from land‐based strengthening exercise training (n = 56; SMD −0.95, 95% CrI −3.89 to 2.04), psychological or behavioral therapy with a focus on sleep (PT/BT sleep; n = 94; SMD −0.89, 95% CrI −2.39 to 0.61), weight loss (n = 41; SMD −1.15, 95% CrI −3.55 to 1.27), and electrotherapy (n = 20; SMD −0.98, 95% CrI −3.28 to 1.34). Additional interventions such as dental splint (n = 29; SMD −1.62, 95% CrI −4.86 to 1.65), tricyclics (n = 43; SMD −1.26, 95% CrI −4.47 to 1.93), and antipsychotics (n = 53; SMD −1.28, 95% CrI −3.56 to 0.97) were suggested to have a potential effect on sleep. However, these could not be confirmed with certainty due to the wide credible intervals, and the certainty of the evidence was generally low. A more definitive effect was noted for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n = 9; SMD −4.51, 95% CrI −7.44 to −1.56) compared with placebo or sham; however, this estimate was derived from indirect evidence.

### In fibromyalgia, some therapies may provide small improvements in pain and quality of life [^115vGKq6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recent research has explored the association of various therapies with reduced pain and improved quality of life in patients suffering from fibromyalgia. The study, a systematic review and meta-analysis, indicates that although some therapies may offer small improvements, the overall impact on patients is limited. Consequently, further research into more effective treatment options for fibromyalgia is warranted.

### An evidence-based self-management package for urinary incontinence in older women: A mixed methods feasibility study [^116XUxVQ]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Existing literature has shown a modest benefit of self-management interventions in older women with urinary incontinence (UI). Compared to pharmacological therapies alone, nonpharmacological interventions, such as behavioral therapy, either alone or combined with other interventions, are more effective in achieving cure or improvement in both stress and urge UI. The clinical effectiveness of self-management of UI has been recognized with respect to symptoms, UI severity, quality of life, and perceptions of improvement when delivered in a group format, with effects maintained for 12 months. Similarly, this study has observed improvements in symptoms and severity with the self-management package and its effects on psychological health. This package appears feasible to modify women's quality of life living with UI. Further studies may be needed to investigate the effectiveness of self-management interventions on both physical and psychosocial outcomes in women with UI, in both short and long term.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The intervention was co-developed with key stakeholders, including women with UI and health professionals. The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were evaluated with women who were not actively engaged with clinical services for UI. Potential positive effects were observed in women's UI symptoms and their psychological status, which were further supported by the women's experiences. However, careful interpretation is needed. The study was not allocation concealed, and the sample size was not sufficiently powered to make robust inferences about the effectiveness of the intervention.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^117BAsps]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia, more specifically with respect to work limitations, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend encouraging patients with FM who are on prolonged sick leave to participate in an appropriate rehabilitation program. The focus should be on improving function, including the possibility of returning to work if possible.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114f5kK2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The primary outcomes of interest were sleep quality, which encompasses the patient's experience of sleep and perceived sleep quality, as well as adverse events. Secondary outcomes included sleep efficiency, calculated as total sleep time divided by total time in bed multiplied by 100%, duration of sleep and/or total sleep time, and disease‐specific quality of life (QoL).

For sleep quality, we identified five patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) validated in people with fibromyalgia through an update of a previously published systematic review. These measures were the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS‐SS), the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS), the Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary (FMSD), and the Sleep Quality Numeric Rating Scale (SQ‐NRS). Single‐item numerical rating scales (NRS) or visual analog scales (VAS) that broadly measure a similar sleep quality construct to that of the SQ‐NRS were also considered proxy measures.

In the absence of an accepted fibromyalgia‐specific QoL tool, we used the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF‐36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) as proxies for disease‐specific measures. Information on how sleep duration and efficiency were assessed, whether self‐reported or objectively measured, was not consistently reported across included studies. We recorded adverse events that occurred in ≥ 10% of participants in included studies and serious adverse events. Outcomes were collected at the end of the intervention period or the first assessment point thereafter.

### The role of sleep in pain and fibromyalgia [^115DGEgt]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common cause of chronic widespread pain, characterized by reduced pressure pain thresholds with hyperalgesia and allodynia. In addition to pain, common symptoms include nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, stiffness, and mood disturbances. The latest research indicates that the dominant pathophysiology in fibromyalgia is abnormal pain processing and central sensitization. Neuroimaging studies have shown that patients with fibromyalgia have similar neural activation to healthy age-matched and gender-matched individuals; however, they have a lower pressure-pain threshold. Polysomnography data has demonstrated that these patients have reduced short-wave sleep and abnormal α-rhythms, suggestive of wakefulness during non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Sleep deprivation in healthy individuals can cause symptoms of fibromyalgia, including myalgia, tenderness, and fatigue, suggesting that sleep dysfunction might be not only a consequence of pain but also pathogenic.

Epidemiological studies indicate that poor sleep quality is a risk factor for the development of chronic widespread pain among an otherwise healthy population. Mechanistically, sleep deprivation impairs descending pain-inhibition pathways that are important in controlling and coping with pain. Clinical trials of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies have shown that improving sleep quality can reduce pain and fatigue, further supporting the hypothesis that sleep dysfunction is a pathogenic stimulus of fibromyalgia.

### Lyrica [^111Xtuve]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Management of fibromyalgia

The efficacy of LYRICA for managing fibromyalgia was established in one 14-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (F1) and one six-month, randomized withdrawal study (F2). Studies F1 and F2 enrolled patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, characterized by a history of widespread pain for three months and pain present at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites. The studies demonstrated a reduction in pain using a visual analog scale. Improvements were also noted based on the patient global assessment (PGIC) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).

- **Study F1**: This 14-week study compared LYRICA total daily doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg with placebo. Patients were enrolled based on a minimum mean baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale and a score of greater than or equal to 40 mm on the 100 mm pain visual analog scale (VAS). The baseline mean pain score in this trial was 6.7. Responders to placebo in an initial one-week run-in phase were not randomized into subsequent phases of the study. A total of 64% of patients randomized to LYRICA completed the study. There was no evidence of a greater effect on pain scores at the 600 mg daily dose compared to the 450 mg daily dose, though dose-dependent adverse reactions were evident. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

### Efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions for individual features of fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115CdrK7]. Pain (2022). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a highly heterogeneous condition, with widespread pain, fatigue, poor sleep, and low mood being the most common symptoms. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended as first-line treatment for fibromyalgia; however, which interventions are effective for different symptoms is not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions on symptoms and disease-specific quality of life.

Seven databases were searched from their inception until June 1, 2020. Randomised controlled trials comparing any nonpharmacological intervention to usual care, waiting list, or placebo in individuals with fibromyalgia aged over 16 years were included, without language restrictions. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) was the primary outcome measure. Standardised mean difference and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a random effects model. The risk of bias was evaluated using the modified Cochrane tool.

Of the 16,251 studies identified, 167 randomised controlled trials (n = 11,012) assessing 22 nonpharmacological interventions were included. Exercise, psychological treatments, multidisciplinary modality, balneotherapy, and massage improved the FIQ score.

- **Subgroup analysis**: Different exercise interventions showed that all forms of exercise improved pain (effect size [ES] -0.72 to -0.96) and depression (ES -0.35 to -1.22), except for flexibility exercise. Mind-body and strengthening exercises improved fatigue (ES -0.77 to -1.00), whereas aerobic and strengthening exercises improved sleep (ES -0.74 to -1.33).

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xURFE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Almost everyone with fibromyalgia has sleep problems. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for the management of fibromyalgia-related sleep problems.

Major electronic databases were searched in November 2021. We focused on randomized controlled trials assessing pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic interventions in adults and children and identified 168 studies for inclusion. We assessed the methodologic quality of included studies using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Our primary outcome of interest was sleep quality assessed using validated patient-reported outcome measures.

Results from primary studies were analyzed using network meta-analyses (NMA). The NMA for sleep quality included 65 studies evaluating 35 treatment categories (8,247 participants). Most studies were at high overall risk of bias. Compared with placebo or sham treatments, there was some evidence that exercise (specifically land-based aerobic exercise training in combination with flexibility training [standardized mean difference (SMD) -4.69, 95% credible interval (CrI) -8.14 to -1.28] and aquatic-based aerobic exercise training [SMD -2.63, 95% CrI -4.74 to -0.58]) may improve sleep. There was also a suggestion that land-based strengthening exercise, psychological and behavioral therapy with a focus on sleep, electrotherapy, weight loss, dental splints, antipsychotics, and tricyclics may have a modest effect on sleep.

### Lyrica [^113dMVXr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia has shown that safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. A 15-week, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 107 pediatric patients, ages 12 through 17 years, at Lyrica total daily doses ranging from 75 to 450 mg per day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 15 in mean pain intensity, derived from an 11-point numeric rating scale. Results showed numerically greater improvement for the pregabalin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, but this did not reach statistical significance. The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the clinical trial included dizziness, nausea, headache, weight gain, and fatigue. The overall safety profile in adolescents was similar to that observed in adults with fibromyalgia.

- **Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established.

### Proteomic investigation in plasma from women with fibromyalgia in response to a 15-wk resistance exercise intervention [^113SSdPi]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal condition with a worldwide prevalence of 2.7%. FM symptoms include generalized musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, all of which have a high impact on everyday life. The general treatment of FM is symptomatically based and includes both pharmacological and nonpharmacological options. Nonpharmacological strategies are often addressed in a multimodal setting, including education, exercise interventions, workplace interventions, and psychological and behavioral therapies.

Individuals with FM are reported to be less physically active, have reduced muscle strength, and experience fear-avoidance behavior toward exercise and potential worsening of symptoms. Nonetheless, physical exercise is considered one of the first options for the treatment of FM and is the only treatment that received a "strong for" recommendation among the European FM treatment recommendations. Different forms of exercise have shown positive effects on clinical symptoms such as pain intensity, muscle strength, fatigue, quality of life, and physical function in FM.

In healthy individuals, exercise improves muscle strength and quality of life and helps to control body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin levels, and lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, exercise has a positive effect on the immune system as it alters immune cells such as leukocytes and releases cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and hormones. Exercise has been proposed to reduce systemic low-grade inflammation. A systemic review found that aerobic exercise is beneficial.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1121wr14]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

This evidence synthesis included 90 RCTs assessing sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia. To our knowledge, our study is the most comprehensive approach to assess the evidence on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia-related sleep problems.

The findings of our network meta-analysis on sleep quality using validated patient-reported outcome measures show that, compared with placebo or sham treatment, some forms of exercise, such as land-based aerobic exercise training combined with flexibility exercise training and aquatic aerobic exercise training, may improve sleep quality. Although our certainty in the evidence is generally low, for all other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, there was a modest effect on sleep quality compared with placebo or sham treatment (credible interval indicated uncertainty, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low). Notably, we did not observe a significant, beneficial effect of pharmacologic interventions on sleep quality.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111Qnwcu]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

- **Search strategy**: Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist with input from our expert advisers to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

- **Study selection**: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel-group, cross-over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention. Studies that compared two or more regimens of the same treatment (e.g. varying doses of the same drug) were included.

### Mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia [^1152ZNEf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Mind-body interventions are based on the holistic principle that mind, body, and behavior are interconnected. These interventions incorporate strategies intended to improve psychological and physical well-being, empower patients to take an active role in their treatment, and enhance coping abilities. Mind-body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to manage symptoms and enhance well-being. Examples of mind-body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies, and relaxation strategies.

- **Objectives**: To review the benefits and harms of mind-body therapies compared to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, both post-intervention and at three- and six-month follow-ups.

- **Search methods**: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO), and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Additionally, searches of reference lists and contact with authors in the field were conducted to identify further relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed trials for low, unclear, or high risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using mean difference (MD).

### Efficacy and safety of gut microbiota-based therapies in autoimmune and rheumatic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 80 randomized controlled trials [^113gwstY]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Gut microbiota-based therapies may have potential to treat celiac sprue, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriasis, fibromyalgia syndrome, primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. However, while this therapy reduced pain in fibromyalgia syndrome, its effect on Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores was not significant. For T1DM, this therapy may improve HbA1c, but its effect on total insulin requirements does not appear to be significant. Meanwhile, gut microbiota-based therapies may not improve the symptoms and/or inflammatory factors associated with spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^116ahm4o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach should be individualized for each patient, depending on the severity of the patient's pain, the presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and the degree of functional impairment. The management of fibromyalgia includes the identification and treatment of all pain sources that may be present in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g. comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g. comorbid irritable bowel syndrome). It is also important to address other symptoms or disorders that commonly occur in patients with fibromyalgia, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, the treatment should strive to improve the patient's function and global health status.

In most cases, the management of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized, controlled trials for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114AuF2m]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

We pooled all sleep quality PROMs together to form an overarching sleep quality outcome and analyzed each individual outcome through sensitivity analyses (results not presented).

For studies reporting more than one sleep quality outcome, we specified a hierarchy based on the most frequently reported outcomes across included studies. The adopted hierarchical order was as follows: PSQI, MOS-SS, JSS, FMSD, and SQ-NRS. In order to address the mixture of "change from baseline" and "final score" data available from included studies, we converted the final scores to "change from baseline" when baseline values were available.

For the imputation of the change from baseline SD, we used a correlation coefficient as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Due to the absence of specific data to calculate the correlation coefficient, we assumed a value of 0.5 and performed a sensitivity analysis using a correlation coefficient of 0.8 to assess whether the results changed. The effect size calculated was the standardized mean difference (SMD), dividing the difference in means between interventions by the estimated pooled between-person SD for that trial. Given that some studies had small sample sizes, we employed the Hedges (adjusted) G method. Effect sizes reported were either SMD for the sleep quality outcome and mean differences (MD) for the remaining outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals or credible intervals (CrI).

### Lyrica [^112HVa7E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lyrica for the management of fibromyalgia was established in one 14-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (F1) and one six-month, randomized withdrawal study (F2). Studies F1 and F2 enrolled patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which include a history of widespread pain for three months and pain present at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites. The studies showed a reduction in pain by visual analog scale. In addition, improvement was demonstrated based on a patient global assessment (PGIC) and on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).

- **Study F1**: This 14-week study compared Lyrica total daily doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg with placebo. Patients were enrolled with a minimum mean baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale and a score of greater than or equal to 40 mm on the 100 mm pain visual analog scale (VAS). The baseline mean pain score in this trial was 6.7. Responders to placebo in an initial one-week run-in phase were not randomized into subsequent phases of the study. A total of 64% of patients randomized to Lyrica completed the study. There was no evidence of a greater effect on pain scores of the 600 mg daily dose than the 450 mg daily dose, but there was evidence of dose-dependent adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115iY79t]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Fifty-two studies (n = 7,127 participants, 35 interventions) of the 56 studies that reported the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA). Four studies were excluded because they did not form part of the main network. Improvements in FIQ were observed for:

- **Land-based aerobic exercise with mixed flexibility exercise training**: (n = 32; MD −19.91, 95% CrI −34.89 to −4.94)
- **Multidisciplinary training**: (n = 81; MD −17.31, 95% CrI −28.38 to −6.29)
- **Land-based mind-body exercise training**: (n = 420; MD −16.18, 95% CrI −22.72 to −9.73)
- **Generic psychological or behavioral therapy (PT/BT generic) with relaxation**: (n = 29; MD −12.07, 95% CrI −20.75 to −3.35)
- **PT/BT for sleep**: (n = 77; MD −11.68, 95% CrI −20.34 to −3.11)
- **Generic PT/BT**: (n = 145; MD −6.23, 95% CrI −12.02 to −0.62)

Positive effects were observed for participants receiving:

- **Antioxidants**: (n = 12; MD −17.75, 95% CrI −34.91 to −0.61)
- **Iron replacement**: (n = 38; MD −15.10, 95% CrI −30.41 to −0.06)
- **Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI)**: (n = 573; MD −9.85, 95% CrI −15.80 to −3.80)
- **Central nervous system (CNS) depressants**: (n = 881; MD −8.83, 95% CrI −14.77 to −2.74)

In general, the magnitude of effects varied across interventions. A large positive effect was also observed after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n = 9; MD −26.29, 95% CrI −37.56 to −15.15); however, as before, we question the reliability of this estimate due to the very small sample size (nine patients in the intervention group) and lack of a proper comparator intervention.

### Association of therapies with reduced pain and improved quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11686q9h]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that results in a significant burden to individuals and society. This study investigates the effectiveness of therapies for reducing pain and improving quality of life (QOL) in people with fibromyalgia. Searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, AMED, PsycInfo, and PEDro databases without language or date restrictions on December 11, 2018, and updated on July 15, 2020. All published randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials that investigated therapies for individuals with fibromyalgia were screened for inclusion.

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the 0 to 10 PEDro scale. Effect sizes for specific therapies were pooled using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach. Pain intensity was measured by the visual analog scale, numerical rating scales, and other valid instruments, while QOL was measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.

A total of 224 trials including 29,962 participants were included. High-quality evidence was found in favor of cognitive behavioral therapy (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.9; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3) for pain in the short term, and in favor of central nervous system depressants (WMD, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.6 to -0.8]) and antidepressants (WMD, -0.5 [95% CI, -0.7 to -0.4]) for pain in the medium term.

### Lyrica [^114CifpK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. A 15-week, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 107 pediatric patients with fibromyalgia, ages 12 through 17 years, at Lyrica total daily doses of 75‑450 mg per day. The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 15 in mean pain intensity (derived from an 11‑point numeric rating scale) showed numerically greater improvement for the pregabalin‑treated patients compared to placebo‑treated patients, but did not reach statistical significance. The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the clinical trial included dizziness, nausea, headache, weight increase, and fatigue. The overall safety profile in adolescents was similar to that observed in adults with fibromyalgia.

- **Adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established.

### Juvenile fibromyalgia: Current status of research and future developments [^115okVHP]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a poorly understood chronic pain condition most commonly affecting adolescent girls. The condition is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and other associated symptoms, including fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, headaches, irritable bowel symptoms, dysautonomia, and mood disorders such as anxiety and/or depression. In the past few years, there has been a greater focus on understanding JFM in adolescents. Research studies have provided insight into the clinical characteristics of this condition and its effect on both short-term and long-term psychosocial and physical functioning. The importance of early and effective intervention is being recognized, as research has shown that symptoms of JFM tend to persist and do not resolve over time, as was previously believed.

Efforts to improve treatments for JFM are underway, and new evidence strongly points to the potential benefits of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving mood and daily functioning. Research into pharmacotherapy and other nonpharmacological options is in progress. Advancements in the understanding of adult fibromyalgia have paved the way for future studies on the diagnosis, assessment, and management of JFM. This review focuses on our knowledge of the condition, provides an update on the latest research advances, and highlights areas for further study.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116g3b1q]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

- **SF-36 MCS score**: Of the studies that reported SF-36 MCS, 15 of 17 (n = 359, 13 interventions) were included in the network meta-analysis, with two excluded as they were not linked in the network. Land-based mind-body exercise (n = 281; MD 7.27, 95% CrI 1.11–13.94) and education (n = 22; MD 10.31, 95% CrI 2.06–19.35) were associated with an improvement in the SF-36 MCS score compared with placebo or sham. In contrast, there was evidence that SF-36 MCS scores were worse after nutritional interventions (n = 36) compared to placebo or sham (n = 1,167; MD −7.96, 95% CrI −14.83 to −1.11). However, there was no clear evidence that SF-36 MCS scores were worse after usual care and electrotherapy as compared to placebo or sham. The remaining interventions showed no clear evidence of a positive effect when compared with placebo or sham.

- **SF-36 PCS score**: Of the studies reporting SF-36 PCS scores, 16 of 17 (n = 401 participants, 13 interventions) were included in the analysis, with one excluded as it did not link with other studies. Compared with placebo or sham (n = 1,355), a better SF-36 PCS score was observed after land-based mind-body exercise training (n = 281; MD 7.61, 95% CrI 3.56–13.06), land-based aerobic exercise training (n = 75; MD 6.17, 95% CrI 1.05–12.81), and the use of CNS depressants (n = 874; MD 2.93, 95% CrI 1.10–4.79). There was insufficient evidence that electrotherapy (n = 20) had a positive effect on the SF-36 PCS score compared with placebo or sham (MD −0.82, 95% CrI −4.13 to 3.97).

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11751wpH]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Sleep duration was reported in two studies involving 363 participants across three interventions. There was insufficient evidence that gabapentinoid (n = 169) increased sleep duration compared with placebo or sham (n = 179; MD 7.40, 95% CrI −9.84 to 24.74). In contrast, SRI (n = 15) appeared to be detrimental to sleep duration compared with placebo or sham (n = 179; MD −24.40, 95% CrI −59.81 to 21.96).

- **Consistency between direct and indirect evidence**: For sleep quality, there was evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence for usual care and aquatic‐based aerobic exercise compared with land‐based mind‐body exercise, land‐based flexibility exercise compared with usual care, and land‐based flexibility exercise compared with aquatic‐based aerobic exercise. In the case of the FIQ, for some intervention comparisons, such as generic psychological or behavioral therapy compared with placebo or sham, and sleep‐focused psychological or behavioral therapy compared with education or usual care, the node‐splitting analysis showed significant disagreement (inconsistency) between direct and indirect estimates.

- **For SF‐36 MCS and PCS**: There was no need to check for the presence of inconsistency between direct and indirect estimates, as the only two closed loops in the network were from a single three‐arm trial.

- **Ranking of interventions**: For sleep quality and FIQ, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and land‐based aerobic with flexibility exercise training were ranked as the top two interventions.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1129RkZe]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The literature searches identified 4,113 citations, and 378 full-text records were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 90 studies (total n = 12,082 participants) assessed sleep quality using one of the PROMs validated in people with fibromyalgia (i.e. PSQI, MOS-SS, JSS, FMSD, and SQ-NRS) and were included in the NMA.

The PRISMA flow diagram for the identification of quantitative studies is shown in Figure 1. For more information, refer to Page MJ, McKenzie JE, Bossuyt PM, et al.

Of the 90 studies, all participants were adults, 94% were women, with an average age ranging from 35.1 to 57.7 years. According to the information from 30 studies that reported ethnicity, most participants were "White" or "Caucasian". Further details of study characteristics are presented in Supplementary Material S3. Across studies, a total of 97 active treatments, alone or in combination, were assessed. Most treatments (78%) were nonpharmacologic. These treatments were grouped into 45 categories (34 nonpharmacologic and 11 pharmacologic) according to their characteristics and mode of action.

### Nonpharmacologic care of patients with fibromyalgia [^117RU6Yh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A key long-term goal for patients with fibromyalgia is for them to become experts in understanding their own symptoms and treatment responses to further successful self-management of their condition. Patient education about fibromyalgia is key, as are several nonpharmacologic strategies.

- **Strategies include**: Encouraging the patient to have a realistic, positive attitude and outlook; engaging in a regular, paced program of physical activity and exercise; and adopting positive sleep hygiene practices. To meet their goals, patients with fibromyalgia will need support and understanding from the clinician and other treatment team members.

### Self-management interventions for chronic widespread pain including fibromyalgia: A systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis [^114WVC4v]. Pain (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is diagnosed when persistent pain is reported over multiple body sites. It is a key feature of conditions such as fibromyalgia, where it is accompanied by other symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive issues. The reported prevalence of CWP in the general population falls between 9.6% and 15%. Fibromyalgia, at the more severe end of the CWP spectrum, has a prevalence of around 2% to 4%, with the highest prevalence in those aged between 40 and 60 years. In addition to pain, fatigue, disrupted sleep, difficulties with concentration, anxiety, and depression are also characteristics of fibromyalgia.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of CWP remain unclear; however, a genetic influence has been demonstrated, and central sensitisation, which refers to an abnormal amplification of neural signalling within the central nervous system, may be a primary mechanism. In addition, there is an association between chronic pain and life traumas, especially childhood trauma.

Increasing emphasis is being placed on the need to support people with CWP to effectively engage with psychosocial and behavioural self-management. Guidelines recommend a limited range of pharmacotherapies to treat severe symptoms, with a primary focus now placed on nonpharmacological interventions as first-line care. Self-management is a complex construct and has been defined as a patient-directed approach with the overarching aim of enhancing participants' health status or quality of life. Self-management approaches seek to bolster participants' skills and knowledge.

### Depression and anxiety disorders: Benefits of exercise, yoga, and meditation [^1179ttwB]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Many people with depression or anxiety turn to nonpharmacologic and nonconventional interventions, including exercise, yoga, meditation, tai chi, or qi gong. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown that these interventions can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. As an adjunctive treatment, exercise seems most helpful for treatment-resistant depression, unipolar depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yoga, whether used as monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy, shows positive effects, particularly for depression. As an adjunctive therapy, it facilitates treatment of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder.

Tai chi and qi gong may be helpful as adjunctive therapies for depression, but effects are inconsistent. Mindfulness-based meditation, used as monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy, has positive effects on depression, and its effects can last for six months or more. Although positive findings are less common in people with anxiety disorders, the evidence supports adjunctive use. There are no apparent negative effects of mindfulness-based interventions, and their general health benefits justify their use as adjunctive therapy for patients with depression and anxiety disorders.

### A systematic review of psychosocial therapies for children with rheumatic diseases [^111V26Ps]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Psychosocial therapies have shown promise for treating rheumatic diseases in adults, though results are mixed. A large systematic review of psychological treatments in adults with rheumatoid arthritis found pooled effect sizes of d = 0.22 for pain and d = 0.27 for functional disability. A systematic review of mind-body therapies for fibromyalgia found that individuals treated with mind-body therapies had greater improvements in pain and global assessment than wait-list controls, but poorer outcomes than individuals who participated in moderate/high-intensity exercise. In addition, a more recent randomized control trial (RCT) of tai chi vs. education and stretching in fibromyalgia concluded a modest benefit in symptoms.

Given studies reporting that psychosocial interventions improve pain and disability in adults with rheumatic conditions, we wanted to examine the evidence for psychosocial treatments to manage pain and disability in children with rheumatic disorders.

### Management of fibromyalgia in primary care [^111JuMw1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Most treatments for patients with fibromyalgia can be provided in primary care practices. When clinicians, therapists, and community resources work together, a range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments can be tailored to provide effective long-term care. Treatments found to be effective for various fibromyalgia symptoms, such as pain and problems with sleep or mood, include antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Additionally, other effective strategies include patient education, light exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Pool exercise for individuals with fibromyalgia [^114mi8qz]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). High credibility.

The benefits of general aerobic exercise for individuals with fibromyalgia have been established. Recently, there have been a number of randomized controlled trials that evaluate the benefits of pool exercise for fibromyalgia. This review will integrate the results of eight pool exercise studies that have been published in the last seven years.

- **Recent findings**: Pool exercise has been evaluated against sedentary control groups, land-based exercise, and immersion in a warm, mineralized pool. Pool exercise has been shown to be as effective as land-based exercise and may have greater benefits with respect to mood and sleep duration. Based on follow-up studies, exercise-induced improvements in physical function, pain, and mood may persist for up to two years. Pool exercise may be better tolerated as an initial means of exercise by individuals with arthritis in weight-bearing joints (because of water buoyancy) or by individuals who fear exercise will exacerbate their pain.

- **Summary**: Pool exercise can be an effective intervention for individuals with fibromyalgia. Future studies should reassess subjects at multiple time points to determine the time course of exercise-induced improvements and further explore the effects of pool exercise on mood and sleep quality.
