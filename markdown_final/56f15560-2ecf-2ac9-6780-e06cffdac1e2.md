## Question

High tsh low free T4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a pattern of high TSH with low free T4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and excluding assay interference. Then, I should classify the disorder into primary versus central hypothyroidism. Next, I will evaluate etiologies, including autoimmune thyroiditis, medications, and pituitary disease. After that, I need to decide on treatment thresholds and targets, including special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics. Finally, I will outline monitoring, pitfalls, and when to refer, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical pattern and its clinical significance. High TSH with low free T4 defines overt primary hypothyroidism, reflecting failure of the thyroid gland with loss of negative feedback and compensatory TSH elevation; this contrasts with subclinical hypothyroidism, where TSH is high but free T4 is normal, and with central hypothyroidism, where free T4 is low but TSH is inappropriately low or normal, so I need to ensure the labs truly show low free T4 and not a transient or spurious result before labeling overt disease [^1129gwkb] [^116Rq9QT].

> Wait, let me verify assay reliability before I anchor on a diagnosis. I should repeat TSH and free T4 on a fresh sample, consider alternate platforms, and rule out analytical interference such as heterophile antibodies, biotin use, or abnormal binding proteins; if results are discordant with the clinical picture, I should send samples to a reference lab for dilution studies or different methods, because spurious TSH elevations or free T4 depressions can mislead management if uncorrected [^114fiaqB] [^112jhSYv] [^115jXbXK].

> Next, I should review the clinical context to support primary hypothyroidism. I will look for symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, and bradycardia, and signs including goiter, delayed reflexes, or periorbital edema; I also need to check for risk factors like autoimmune disease, family history, prior thyroid surgery or radioiodine, and medications that impair thyroid function, while remembering that older adults may have subtle or atypical presentations [^113mkwj1].

> I will now examine etiologies, starting with the most common cause. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) accounts for the majority of overt hypothyroidism in iodine-replete settings; I should confirm this with thyroid peroxidase antibodies, recognizing that a positive TPOAb increases the likelihood of progression and supports the diagnosis when TSH is elevated with low free T4 [^113mkwj1] [^1151QfPg].

> Hold on, I should verify medication and iatrogenic contributors before concluding autoimmune disease. Amiodarone, lithium, interferon, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors can cause hypothyroidism; prior thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ablation can lead to permanent hypothyroidism; and inadequate levothyroxine adherence or malabsorption can present with low free T4 and elevated TSH, so I need to reconcile dosing history, formulation switches, and gastrointestinal factors before attributing to primary gland failure [^113XpJMe] [^113mkwj1].

> But wait, what if the pattern reflects central rather than primary disease. If free T4 is low and TSH is inappropriately low, normal, or only mildly elevated, I should suspect central hypothyroidism due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease; in that scenario, I must not rely on TSH to guide therapy and should evaluate other pituitary axes, including morning cortisol, gonadal steroids, prolactin, and consider pituitary MRI when indicated [^116Rq9QT] [^115QehcY] [^117NV6Ub].

> Now, I need to decide on treatment thresholds and targets. For overt primary hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine is indicated regardless of TSH magnitude; for subclinical hypothyroidism, treatment is generally reserved for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or for symptomatic patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, acknowledging that many adults with TSH < 10 mIU/L do not benefit from therapy and may normalize spontaneously, so shared decision-making is essential [^113mkwj1] [^11777Vu1] [^11777Vu1].

> Let me think about dosing and titration. Typical full replacement in adults is about 1.6 mcg/kg/day, but I should start low in older adults or those with cardiac disease and titrate every 6–8 weeks to normalize TSH; in central hypothyroidism, I must target free T4 in the upper half of normal rather than TSH, and I should recheck free T4 4–6 weeks after dose changes to avoid under- or overtreatment [^113mkwj1] [^112GQShE] [^116Va2cz].

> I should double-check special populations. In pregnancy, maternal hypothyroidism is defined by elevated TSH with decreased FT4, and treatment should be initiated promptly with trimester-specific targets because untreated hypothyroidism adversely affects maternal and fetal outcomes; in infants with congenital hypothyroidism, immediate levothyroxine is indicated when TSH is elevated with low FT4, with treatment thresholds lower than in adults; in older adults, I should avoid overtreatment given risks of atrial fibrillation and fractures, and consider that many with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L may not benefit from therapy [^111RdcN1] [^1134Jcu6] [^1151QfPg].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. After starting or changing levothyroxine, I will recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks, aiming for a TSH in the reference range, while remembering that in central hypothyroidism I should monitor free T4 instead; once stable, annual monitoring suffices, but I should increase frequency in pregnancy or if interacting drugs are introduced; I also need to ensure consistent timing of labs, preferably in the morning before dosing, and consider assay-specific reference ranges [^113mkwj1] [^116Va2cz] [^116NZHCj].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Nonthyroidal illness can suppress TSH and obscure hypothyroidism, so I should interpret TFTs in clinical context and, when possible, reassess after recovery; assay interference can mimic or mask disease, so discordant results warrant repeat testing on alternate platforms; and in patients on biotin, I should hold supplements for at least 72 hours before labs to avoid spurious results [^113XpJMe] [^112jhSYv] [^114fiaqB].

> I need to ensure I have a clear referral plan. Indications for endocrinology referral include suspected central hypothyroidism, refractory or complicated cases, pregnancy planning or pregnancy, pediatric disease, or diagnostic uncertainty after initial evaluation; urgent referral is warranted for myxedema coma or severe biochemical hypothyroidism with significant comorbidity [^113mkwj1] [^111RdcN1] [^1134Jcu6].

> In summary, high TSH with low free T4 establishes overt primary hypothyroidism; I should confirm the pattern, exclude assay interference, identify the cause — most often autoimmune thyroiditis — and initiate levothyroxine with individualized dosing and targets, while remembering that TSH guides therapy in primary disease but not in central disease; careful monitoring, attention to special populations, and vigilance for pitfalls ensure safe, effective care and prevent overtreatment [^113mkwj1] [^116Rq9QT] [^11777Vu1].

High TSH with low free T4 indicates **overt primary hypothyroidism** [^113mkwj1], most often due to autoimmune thyroiditis [^1151QfPg]. Confirm with **repeat TSH and free T4** [^1121spBy], check **TPO antibodies** [^112wUhU4], and assess for symptoms and cardiovascular risk. Start **levothyroxine** [^113mkwj1] if symptomatic, TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, or if pregnancy is planned or present [^111RdcN1]; start low and titrate to normalize TSH. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually. If TSH is high with normal free T4, that is subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]; observe unless TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptoms are present [^114LBMH9].

---

## Physiological basis of high TSH and low free T4

- **Primary hypothyroidism**: The thyroid fails to produce enough T4, so the pituitary increases TSH to stimulate the thyroid [^113mkwj1].
- **TSH and free T4 relationship**: TSH rises exponentially as free T4 falls, so even small drops in free T4 cause large TSH increases [^112AZiH6].
- **Overt vs subclinical**: Overt hypothyroidism has high TSH and low free T4; subclinical has high TSH with normal free T4 [^1129gwkb].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Confirmatory tests

Confirmatory testing should include **repeat TSH and free T4** to confirm the pattern and exclude lab error [^notfound]. Measure **TPO antibodies** to support autoimmune thyroiditis as the cause [^112wUhU4].

---

### Additional tests (as indicated)

Additional tests may include **total T3**, which is often low or low-normal and helps distinguish from subclinical disease [^notfound]. Evaluate **lipid profile** because hypothyroidism commonly causes hyperlipidemia [^116UT86r]. Assess **other pituitary hormones** if central hypothyroidism is suspected [^115GhaAE].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

General principles include **levothyroxine** as first-line therapy [^113mkwj1]. Titrate to normalize TSH, with targets individualized to age, comorbidities, and pregnancy status [^112GQShE].

---

### Specific clinical scenarios

- **Symptomatic patients**: Treat regardless of TSH level [^113mkwj1].
- **Asymptomatic patients**: Treat if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or if pregnancy is planned or present [^114LBMH9].
- **Elderly patients**: Start low and titrate slowly to avoid cardiac complications [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Immediate treatment with higher targets (TSH 0.1–2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester) [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **TSH every 6–8 weeks** after initiation or dose changes until stable, then annually. Also assess **clinical response**, including symptoms, weight, and cardiovascular status [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of untreated high TSH and low free T4

- **Cardiovascular**: Heart failure, ischemic heart disease, dyslipidemia [^1151QfPg].
- **Neuropsychiatric**: Depression, cognitive impairment, neuropathy [^notfound].
- **Reproductive**: Infertility, menstrual irregularities, pregnancy complications [^notfound].
- **Musculoskeletal**: Myopathy, osteoporosis [^notfound].
- **Myxedema coma**: Life-threatening decompensated hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

With appropriate levothyroxine therapy, **prognosis is excellent** [^113mkwj1], with symptom resolution and normalization of TSH. Long-term risks of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and neuropsychiatric complications are reduced with treatment [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: High TSH with normal free T4; observe unless TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or symptoms are present [^114LBMH9].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4; manage differently and monitor free T4, not TSH [^116Rq9QT].
- **Assay interference**: Rare; consider if results are discordant with clinical picture [^112jhSYv].

---

High TSH with low free T4 indicates **overt primary hypothyroidism** [^113mkwj1]; confirm, identify the cause, and treat with levothyroxine, tailoring to symptoms, TSH level, age, comorbidities, and pregnancy status.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

TSH-secreting pituitary tumor — diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum TSH level associated with elevated free T4 estimates and T3 concentrations, usually with a pituitary tumor on MRI and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with thyroid hormone resistance in a thyrotoxic patient.

---

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QehcY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1129gwkb]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116NZHCj]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115jXbXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

American Thyroid Association — diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (Recommendation 78) states that diagnosis should be made using serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values with either total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) using adjusted reference ranges or free T4 and total T3 with trimester-specific normal reference ranges; this is a Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. If trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, consideration should be given to utilizing total T4 and T3 levels and multiply the nonpregnancy reference range by 1.5 after week 16.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PVhnp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed.

The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12. 5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. 8 In selected cases, the risk of progression to overt disease may be closer to 20 percent per year. 9 Consideration of these possible outcomes affects the decision about whether to treat or to observe without treatment.

Dry skin, cold intolerance and easy fatigability were significantly more common in the patients with raised TSH levels, and these symptoms improved after treatment with thyroid hormone. In another study 11 of 69 female patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, a clinical index based on symptoms and physical signs was shown to be more abnormal in patients with higher TSH levels, even though all patients had normal serum levels of T 4 and free T 4. These studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed have clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

4. 5 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 FT 4 level is used to distinguish clinical from subclinical hypothyroidism. Routinely evaluating total T 3, total T 4, or FT 3 levels is not indicated. If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. 6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided.

For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels.

TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks. 9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^111yC7gv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

True Biochemical Hyperthyroidism With Nonsuppressed TSH

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4

Thyroxine therapy, including with poor compliance

Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can cause a biochemical pattern of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In this context, a seemingly appropriate increase in thyroxine dosage (perhaps to a supraphysiological level) can normalize TSH levels but be associated with concomitantly elevated circulating THs, raising the possibility of underlying RTHβ. Distinguishing this clinical situation from true coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism (which occurs rarely), is discussed further below.

Separate to this, it is also recognized that a subset of hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological dosage, can exhibit raised circulating FT4 but normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon has been attributed to diminished activity of type 2 deiodinase, reducing the generation of T3 (from its T4 precursor) that is available to inhibit pituitary TSH secretion.

Deficiency of selenocysteine-containing proteins, including deiodinase enzymes

Over 25 human proteins, including the thyroid deiodinase enzymes, contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during their translation is dependent on a unique cellular pathway that includes its own transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA (Ser)Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1-1) and a protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2), which binds a specific sequence (SElenium Cysteine Insertion Sequence [SECIS]) located in the 3′-untranslated region of all selenoprotein mRNAs. Biallelic mutations in SECISBP2 cause a rare multisystem disorder, often presenting in childhood with growth retardation and developmental delay. Diminished activity of deiodinase enzymes and low circulating selenoproteins cause a distinctive biochemical signature of raised FT4, normal or low FT3, normal or raised TSH, elevated reverse T3 and low circulating selenium concentrations in all patients (Table 4); this biochemical pattern has also been documented in 2 patients with selenoprotein deficiency due to a homozygous nucleotide substitution in TRU-TCA1-1.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

On the basis of expert opinion, if the confirmatory serum TSH is > 20 mIU/L, L-T4 treatment should be initiated even if FT4 is normal. If the confirmatory serum TSH is elevated but ≤ 20 mIU/L, treatment may be initiated, or alternatively serum TSH and FT4 may be followed closely every 1 to 2 weeks without treatment. Because repeated TSH elevation above 10 mIU/L has been associated with adverse outcomes in children with congenital hypothyroidism, expert opinion suggests that persistent TSH elevation > 10 mIU/L is an indication to initiate L-T4 treatment. For persistent elevations between 5 and 10 mIU/L after 4 weeks of age, the upper limit of normal TSH in infants age 1 to 3 months is around 4.1 to 4.8 mIU/L, and although TSH elevation above 5 mIU/L beyond 1 to 3 months is generally abnormal, there is insufficient evidence to support treatment versus observation; consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist can facilitate a patient-specific management plan.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^113jZXuL]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that chronic disease, frequent in older adults, could be associated with non-thyroidal illness (NTI) and in severe cases may result in decreased fT4, thus generating false positives. Yet, TSH elevations are often found in the recovery phase after NTI mimicking SCHT.

Alternatively, the PPV of current screening for thyroid dysfunction could be improved by elevation of the TSH cutoff value. Several other authors have proposed this approach. However, with this strategy (model 2), individuals with hypothyroidism and a limited elevation of TSH would be missed. Furthermore, in our population the increase in PPV was only limited compared with the fT4-based strategy.

Some limitations have to be acknowledged. Firstly, due to the retrospective nature of the study, we cannot exclude that individuals included in the study may have had a history of thyroid disease, which we could not filter from the available laboratory data, for example in cases where patients have visited other laboratories for checkups. Second, the study group was relatively small. Further prospective studies with sufficient power are needed to validate our findings. Third, the determination of optimal cutoff values for TSH and fT4 (which currently vary significantly within geographical areas and within method groups) should also be investigated in follow-up studies. Yet, this is hampered by the fact that a gold standard test for hypothyroidism is lacking, the combination of test results from two tests, fT4 and TSH, determines the diagnosis.

In conclusion, our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient's perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) in hypopituitary patients — diagnostic considerations emphasize that low-normal free thyroxine (fT4) may suggest CH, but confirmation is difficult because there are no validated thyroid function measures in this population; studies have suggested that 10–18% of high-risk pituitary patients have unrecognized CH with low-normal fT4 levels, and suggested approaches for patients with low-normal fT4 levels include starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20%; serum T3 or free T3 (fT3) levels are generally not helpful, peripheral indices of thyroid hormone action lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity, and classifying CH based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness to exogenous TSH-releasing hormone has not proven useful in clinical practice.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^111hctbK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Although age specific TSH targets may be considered, especially in the context of high cardiovascular risk, this strategy is based on the findings of studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid people. However, patients with hypothyroidism need a higher concentration of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH concentration compared with euthyroid controls. Consequently, a hypothyroid patient receiving thyroid replacement therapy and a euthyroid patient with comparable TSH concentrations are not expected to have comparable circulating free thyroxine concentrations. The same is true of free triiodothyronine concentrations in patients who have had total thyroidectomy. Therefore, any extrapolations on the association between optimal TSH concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy based on studies in euthyroid patients should be treated with caution, as serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations (relevant to cardiovascular physiology) may differ significantly between the two groups.

Moreover, in primary studies in euthyroid or subclinically hypothyroid patients, and in the related meta-analyses and reviews, thyroid function testing was done only at baseline. The potential therefore exists for misclassification bias in all estimates to date as a result of established and anticipated changes in thyroid hormone production over the life course of a patient, as well as instances of transient thyroid dysfunction (such as non-thyroidal illness or following the hyperthyroid phase of a painless thyroiditis). A person classified as euthyroid at baseline might go on to develop hypothyroidism, overt or subclinical, whereas those classified as subclinically hypothyroid might be found to be euthyroid on follow-up thyroid function testing.

Similar limitations affect studies assessing the association between thyroid dysfunction and risk of fracture, and whether variation in TSH concentration within normal limits may significantly affect the skeleton or whether any effect is insignificant in clinical terms (fracture risk remains unaffected) remains unclear. This is further challenged by evidence suggesting that free thyroxine concentrations are the main driver of the above clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to explore whether TSH concentration is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, mortality, and fractures in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. We treated TSH as a time varying covariate to account for variation in TSH concentration over time within individuals.

### Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism [^116UT86r]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism — laboratory patterns and screening notes are as follows: In Primary Hypothyroidism (thyroid failure), free thyroxine (FT4) is low or normal and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated, whereas in Central Hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic cause), FT4 is low but TSH may be normal or low (rare). Thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibodies) may be helpful in determining underlying etiology of hypothyroidism, and total and free triiodothyronine (T3) are generally not necessary for screening and monitoring. Mildly abnormal TSH levels (< 10 uIU/ml) with normal FT4 are not likely to cause symptoms and can be followed and repeated over time, and a good portion of children with this subclinical hypothyroidism revert back to normal thyroid function over time. Hyperlipidemia may be seen secondary to hypothyroidism; consider screening with TSH, FT4 in dyslipidemia, and consider screening for hypothyroidism in depression especially in setting of poor linear growth. Thyroid ultrasonography is not generally required unless thyroid gland is significantly enlarged and/or asymmetric, or there is suspicion of thyroid nodule. Common obesity is generally exogenous and unlikely to be secondary to hypothyroidism, and screening for thyroid dysfunction is not recommended in absence of symptoms, poor linear growth or other risk factors.

Congenital hypothyroidism — confirmatory serum sample–based treatment and monitoring: If serum TSH is elevated and serum FT4 is low, initiate (or continue) L-T4 treatment. If serum TSH is > 20 mIU/L and serum FT4 is normal, initiate (or continue) L-T4 treatment. If serum TSH is elevated but ≤ 20 mIU/L and serum FT4 is normal, L-T4 treatment may be initiated, or serum TSH and FT4 may be monitored closely every 1 to 2 weeks without treatment; if FT4 becomes low, or if TSH elevation > 10 mIU/L persists beyond 4 weeks of age, L-T4 treatment is recommended. In infants with serum TSH elevation > 5 mIU/L but ≤ 10 mIU/L that persists beyond 4 weeks of age, there is insufficient evidence to recommend treatment versus observation, and consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended. If serum TSH is normal or low and serum FT4 is low, evaluate for possible central hypothyroidism with further testing as clinically indicated; obtain confirmatory serum testing, including TSH with FT4; measuring a thyroxine-binding globulin concentration when T4 is low but FT4 is normal may assist; infants with central CH should be evaluated for additional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and consideration should be given to the timing of this evaluation before starting L-T4 treatment because such treatment may lower cortisol levels.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT) is defined as a consistently elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with a free T4 (fT4) within the reference range. This diagnosis may lead to additional monitoring, levothyroxine therapy and increased patient concerns, despite lack of evidence of treatment benefit in older adults. In order to avoid this diagnosis, we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction, in older adults in primary care and compared it with TSH-based screening. Individuals aged > 65years in primary care were selected for this retrospective study when both TSH and fT4 were individually requested irrespective of the TSH value. Exclusion criteria were C-reactive protein > 10 mg/l or a history of thyroid hormone monitoring in the previous year. Screening based on fT4 instead of TSH decreased reflex testing from 23.8% to 11.2%. The positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism increased from 17.3% to 52.2%. The negative predictive value was 96.1% with TSH-based screening versus 97.8% with fT4-based screening. Elevation of the TSH cutoff value from 4.2 to 6.5 mU/l resulted in a reflex test percentage of 12.5% and a PPV of 31.0%. Our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow-up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

### Elevated free thyroxine and non-suppressed thyrotropin [^111h6Ex7]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A young man was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 10 years prior to current presentation after a random health screening revealed an elevated free thyroxine (fT4) of 36.9 pmol/L. During that time, he saw multiple physicians and was treated with carbimazole intermittently. His repeat thyroid function tests showed persistently elevated fT4 ranging 25–35.7 pmol/L and non-suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations of 6.78–22.1 mIU/L. He had a smooth, firm and non-tender goitre. At our institution, laboratory interference was first excluded by serial dilution study (TSH) and retesting of TSH and fT4 on alternate assay, which gave reproducible results. His normal α-subunit and sex hormone binding globulin, partially suppressed TSH by high dose triiodothyronine (T3), and positive TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation were consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct sequencing of thyroid hormone receptor-β gene, revealing a heterozygous R320 L mutation that causes reduced T3 affinity and reduced corepressor dissociation.

Introduction

Screening for thyroid dysfunction is frequently performed in older individuals presenting with fatigue and general malaise to exclude thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disease is largely biochemical. Hence, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) cutoff values, which vary significantly between laboratories, are important determinants of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. Current screening guidelines for thyroid dysfunction in primary care suggest a TSH assay followed by analysis of fT4, if TSH results are outside the reference interval (reflex testing). TSH is a sensitive marker. Linear changes in fT4 lead to exponential changes in TSH. Hence, TSH has traditionally been the first choice screening test.

A consistently elevated TSH with an fT4 within the reference range results in the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT). Although associations between SCHT and some areas of medicine such as cardio-renal metabolic disease are still under investigation, in older persons (65 years and over) SCHT is generally believed not to be associated with quality of life, symptom burden, physical or cognitive functioning, other diseases or mortality. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that older adults with SCHT do not benefit from levothyroxine supplementation. Still, in daily practice, the diagnosis SCHT leads to additional monitoring, unnecessary treatment and increased patient concerns.

Therefore, fT4-based screening to identify clinical thyroid disease would potentially be a more efficient screening strategy for older adults with possible symptoms of thyroid disease. This strategy could reduce costs and patient concerns. Several reports dating from the '80's and '90's have already suggested such a testing algorithm. Alternatively, TSH decision limits could be adjusted to reduce unnecessary reflex testing and thus reduce unwarranted monitoring.

In this retrospective study we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in older adults in primary care compared with TSH-based screening. Furthermore, the alternative approach of elevating TSH decision limits was investigated in parallel.

### Screening, diagnosis and management of congenital hypothyroidism: European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guideline [^116QYEKb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism — evidence context for treatment thresholds: L‑T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low; the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/l, supporting immediate treatment above this value; given the critical period from birth to the age of 3 years, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/l with monitoring and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located; many, but not all, patients have permanent disease particularly when early TSH is high (e.g., > 100 mU/l) with normal FT4; families should be informed this is a 'gray area' and that many clinicians would advise 'playing safe' and treating during early childhood.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of CeH by the combined findings of serum free T4 concentrations below the LLN and inappropriately low/normal TSH concentrations on at least 2 separate determinations, and after exclusion of other conditions, including:

- non-thyroidal illness

- isolated maternal hypothyroxinemia (interpret in the context of trimester-specific free T4 reference ranges for pregnant patients)

- levothyroxine withdrawal syndrome

- recovery from thyrotoxicosis

- technical assay problems or interference, or defects in TBG (TBG defects in case of total T4 determination or calculation of free T4 index)

- drugs reducing TSH secretion (corticosteroids, dopamine, cocaine, anticonvulsants or antipsychotics, metformin)

- premature birth (delayed TSH rise in hypothyroid infants)

- allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (MCT8 mutations)

- THRA mutations (RTHα)

- TSHβ mutations with conserved bioactivity but lost immunoreactivity of circulating TSH.

Summary

When no definitive diagnosis of permanent CH was made in the first weeks or months of life, then re-evaluation of the HPT axis after the age of 2 to 3 years is indicated, particularly in children with a GIS, and in those with presumed isolated central CH (1/++0).
For a precise diagnosis, LT4 treatment should be phased out over a 4 to 6 weeks period or just stopped, and full re-evaluation should be carried out after 4 weeks, consisting of (at least) fT4 and TSH measurement.
If primary hypothyroidism is confirmed (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L), consider thyroid imaging and, if possible, genetic testing; if central CH is likely (fT4 below the lower limit of the reference interval in combination with a low normal of only mildly elevated TSH), consider evaluating the other anterior pituitary functions and genetic testing.
If TSH is above the upper limit of the reference interval but < 10 mU/L (primary CH) or fT4 just above the lower limit of the reference interval (central CH), then continue withdrawal and retest in another 3 to 4 weeks (1/++0).
If a child with no permanent CH diagnosis and a GIS requires an LT4 dose < 3 μg/kg per day at the age of 6 months, then re-evaluation can be done already at that time (1/++0).
We recommend avoiding iodine as an antiseptic during peri- and neonatal period, as it can cause transient CH (1/++0).

### Central hypothyroidism in adults: better understanding for better care [^111AW8qM]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare cause of hypothyroidism generally related to a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or arising as an iatrogenic complication. In adults, CH may be secondary to quantitative and/or qualitative alterations in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. The disease is difficult to diagnose clinically because it lacks specific clinical signs and these may be masked by other anterior pituitary hormone secretion deficiencies. In patients with long-standing and marked CH, a diagnosis may be made based on low free T4 levels and normal, low or moderately increased TSH levels. In patients with early-stage or moderate CH, exploration of the circadian TSH cycle, determination of TSH response after a TRH test or recombinant TSH injection, estimation of TSH index, or evaluation of peripheral indexes of thyroid hormone metabolism may be required to establish a diagnosis. Regarding treatment, patients should receive levothyroxine replacement therapy, but hormone objectives during follow-up need to be precisely determined in order to reduce cardiovascular risks and to improve the quality of life of patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116Sn7Cd]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Va2bp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult hypothyroidism — scope, screening, and therapy emphasize that the guidelines primarily address ambulatory patients with biochemically confirmed primary hypothyroidism whose thyroid status has been stable for at least several weeks and do not deal with myxedema coma. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations but is not sufficient for assessing hospitalized patients or when central hypothyroidism is either present or suspected, and the standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine which must be tailored to the individual patient.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^115JkKX9]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism management — persistent hyperthyrotropinemia with normal free thyroxine (FT4): For cases with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) persistently elevated but ≤ 10 mIU/L with normal FT4, there is insufficient evidence to determine if the treatment of persistent hyperthyrotropinemia is of clinical benefit, although many practitioners elect to treat it out of caution, and it is critical that patients not be lost to follow-up while trialing of levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^116HtLrt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related endocrine adverse events (irAEs) — diagnostic localization and thyroid axis testing — require measuring both primary and pituitary hormones. Low morning cortisol suggests adrenal insufficiency but does not localize the defect; a low adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suggests hypophysitis, pituitary mass, or iatrogenic causes, whereas in primary adrenal insufficiency the morning ACTH will be elevated. For thyroid evaluation, low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be consistent with either hyperthyroidism or central hypothyroidism, so a free thyroxine (FT4) level is needed; drawing both TSH and FT4 is especially important when hypothyroidism is suspected because in hypophysitis TSH can remain within the reference range, and only an FT4 will detect hypothyroidism.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.
