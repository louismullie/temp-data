## Question

Should a smoker be on aspirin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a smoker should be on aspirin or a DOAC, and how to decide between them across common cardiovascular scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary indication driving antithrombotic choice. Then, I should verify how smoking status modifies absolute ischemic and bleeding risk without overdetermining drug class selection. Next, I will review scenario-specific evidence for AF, chronic CAD/PAD, VTE, and primary prevention. After that, I need to check bleeding trade-offs, especially with combination therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and emphasize smoking cessation as the highest-yield intervention, while confirming any exceptions or caveats that might change management in edge cases [^113FL5uJ].

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle before diving into scenarios. Smoking is a vascular risk amplifier that raises baseline thrombotic risk and can increase absolute benefit from preventive therapies, but it does not independently dictate aspirin versus DOAC selection; the indication does, and then we individualize by ischemic and bleeding risk within that indication, such as AF requiring oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention, CAD/PAD where antiplatelet therapy is standard and dual pathway inhibition is considered in select high-risk patients, and VTE where anticoagulation is foundational therapy [^115doh8n] [^1153sBjX] [^113snL8X].

> Now, I will examine atrial fibrillation because this is where aspirin is often mistakenly considered. Wait, I should double-check my assumption that aspirin might be "safer" in AF. The AVERROES program demonstrated that apixaban prevents stroke/systemic embolism better than aspirin and with comparable major bleeding, which corrects the common misperception that aspirin is meaningfully safer than anticoagulation in AF; thus, when anticoagulation is indicated, a DOAC is preferred and aspirin monotherapy is inferior and not safer, with the caveat that combination antiplatelet-anticoagulant therapy is reserved only for separate compelling indications like recent PCI, and otherwise should be avoided to limit bleeding risk [^11152cqz] [^114pWCvP] [^113su7Tg].

> Next, I should review chronic coronary disease or symptomatic PAD without AF. Hold on, let me verify the standard of care first. Single antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin remains the default for secondary prevention, and in carefully selected higher-risk patients with acceptable bleeding risk, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin reduces major cardiovascular events versus aspirin alone at the expense of increased major bleeding; notably, the COMPASS-based FDA labeling embeds high-risk features and explicitly includes smoking as a qualifying risk factor in younger CAD patients, reinforcing that smoking elevates absolute risk and thus potential absolute benefit from dual pathway inhibition, provided bleeding risk is not prohibitive [^1171F4iz] [^1153sBjX] [^114p213m].

> I will now examine venous thromboembolism. For acute DVT/PE, DOAC therapy is first-line; after completing initial anticoagulation, extended-phase management should be individualized, and if anticoagulation is stopped after an unprovoked event, aspirin confers a modest reduction in recurrence compared with placebo but is clearly less effective than continuing reduced-dose DOAC, so when bleeding risk is acceptable, extended low-dose DOAC (for example rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily) is preferred over aspirin for secondary prevention [^113snL8X] [^112UEpPj] [^117DC67T].

> But wait, what if the question is about primary prevention in a smoker without established ASCVD, AF, or VTE. I should confirm that neither aspirin nor a DOAC is routinely indicated here. Contemporary guidance restricts aspirin to select very high-risk primary prevention contexts given marginal net benefit and increased bleeding, and DOACs have no role in primary prevention of arterial events in the general population; the emphasis should be aggressive risk factor modification, especially smoking cessation, statins, and blood pressure control, with individualized decisions if diabetes or other high-risk features are present [^115doh8n] [^115ahS4E] [^115v7bd3].

> Next, I should review smoking-specific pharmacologic considerations to ensure I am not missing a rationale to favor aspirin uniquely in smokers. The enhanced antiplatelet response with clopidogrel in smokers, the so-called "smoker's paradox", has been demonstrated, but this pertains to P2Y12 blockade rather than aspirin's COX-1 mechanism, and it does not imply superiority of aspirin monotherapy in smokers; in fact, the CAPRIE post hoc analysis and PARADOX mechanistic study suggest smokers derive relatively greater benefit from clopidogrel versus aspirin, which should not be overgeneralized to recommend aspirin for smokers per se, and underscores that smoking modifies platelet pharmacodynamics rather than redefining indications for aspirin versus anticoagulation [^117H99sH] [^1158fBUw] [^1116QzCR].

> Hold on, I should verify bleeding trade-offs, particularly for combined DOAC plus aspirin use without a clear dual indication. Observational data in AF/VTE populations show more bleeding and more healthcare utilization with DOAC plus aspirin versus DOAC alone when no clear aspirin indication exists, and meta-analytic data in ACS contexts show that adding an oral anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy reduces ischemic events modestly but substantially increases clinically significant bleeding, reinforcing that combination therapy should be avoided unless there is a strong, time-limited reason such as recent stenting or select CAD/PAD scenarios aligned with COMPASS criteria [^116qZRRN] [^115W6YhE] [^112UasHC].

> Let me think about scenarios where I might inadvertently recommend a DOAC after acute coronary syndrome outside indications. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the ACS evidence. Low-dose rivaroxaban on top of antiplatelet therapy has signal for benefit in select ACS trials and is endorsed variably by European guidance for high ischemic and low bleeding risk, but there is no broad U.S. approval for NOACs in post-ACS outside the chronic CAD/PAD COMPASS indication, so routine use after ACS in the U.S. should not be extrapolated beyond labeled contexts and trials, again returning us to indication-based prescribing rather than smoking-driven drug choice [^111vJREL] [^1153sBjX].

> I should now synthesize this into a decision pathway without losing nuance. If the indication is AF or active VTE, choose a DOAC and avoid aspirin unless there is a separate antiplatelet indication; if the indication is stable CAD/PAD without AF, default to aspirin and consider low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin for high ischemic risk and acceptable bleeding risk; if there is no established vascular disease, neither aspirin nor a DOAC is generally indicated for primary prevention in smokers, where smoking cessation provides the largest absolute risk reduction; across all branches, smoking increases baseline risk and thus increases absolute benefit and harm, which mandates careful bleeding risk assessment before intensifying therapy [^113FL5uJ] [^1171F4iz] [^1153sBjX] [^115doh8n].

> But wait, let me verify the key caveats to avoid unsafe combinations. Never combine a DOAC with aspirin or other antiplatelet agents without a clear, guideline-supported dual indication and a plan to minimize duration, because additive bleeding risk is consistent across studies; when dual pathway inhibition is used in CAD/PAD, confirm high ischemic and low-to-intermediate bleeding risk, counsel patients on bleeding signs, and consider gastroprotection where appropriate, while continuously reinforcing smoking cessation as the most impactful intervention for risk modification in smokers [^115W6YhE] [^1171F4iz] [^112UasHC].

> Final check and bottom line before I conclude. Smoking heightens thrombotic risk but does not change the fundamental indication hierarchy: DOACs for AF/VTE, aspirin for ASCVD secondary prevention, selective addition of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily to aspirin for high-risk chronic CAD/PAD when bleeding risk is acceptable, and neither agent for routine primary prevention; combination therapy without a compelling dual indication increases bleeding and should be avoided, while smoking cessation remains the most effective strategy to reduce events in every scenario discussed [^11152cqz] [^1153sBjX] [^113snL8X] [^116qZRRN].

---

Not necessarily — smoking alone does not determine antithrombotic choice; use **aspirin for secondary prevention** of ASCVD [^1171F4iz] and **DOACs for AF or VTE** when indicated [^113FL5uJ]. In smokers with stable CAD or PAD at high ischemic and low bleeding risk, consider **rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID plus aspirin** [^1153sBjX] [^114p213m]. Avoid combining aspirin with DOACs unless a clear indication exists due to increased bleeding [^116qZRRN] [^112UasHC]. Smoking increases thrombotic risk, but therapy should be based on clinical indications and risk assessment, not smoking status alone [^117H99sH].

---

## Clinical indications for aspirin in smokers

Aspirin is indicated for **secondary prevention** [^1171F4iz] in patients with established ASCVD, including smokers, and is recommended for indefinite use. It reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by approximately 20–30% but increases major bleeding risk by 1.4–1.6-fold [^112QfLp4]. In smokers with stable CAD or PAD at high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk, adding low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg BID) [^1153sBjX] to aspirin is recommended [^114p213m].

---

## Clinical indications for DOACs in smokers

DOACs are indicated for **stroke prevention in AF** [^113FL5uJ] and for **treatment and prevention of VTE**. Smoking alone is not an indication; smokers with AF or VTE should receive DOACs per standard indications [^113FL5uJ]. DOACs are preferred over warfarin in many settings due to fewer interactions, no routine monitoring, and lower intracranial bleeding risk [^111Dw8YH].

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety of aspirin versus DOACs in smokers

| **Clinical scenario** | **Aspirin** | **DOACs** |
|-|-|-|
| Secondary prevention of ASCVD | - Effective [^1171F4iz] <br/> - Increased bleeding risk [^112QfLp4] | Not indicated unless AF or VTE present [^113FL5uJ] |
| Stroke prevention in AF | - Inferior to DOACs [^114pWCvP] <br/> - Higher stroke risk [^113FL5uJ] | - Superior efficacy [^113FL5uJ] <br/> - Lower intracranial bleeding risk |
| Treatment/prevention of VTE | - Inferior to DOACs [^113FL5uJ] <br/> - Higher recurrence risk [^112UEpPj] | - Superior efficacy <br/> - Lower intracranial bleeding risk [^113FL5uJ] |

---

## Impact of smoking on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Smoking increases **platelet activation and aggregation** [^117AkHU1], potentially reducing aspirin efficacy and contributing to aspirin resistance. Smoking induces CYP1A2 [^1158fBUw], which can alter the metabolism of some anticoagulants; DOACs are less affected by smoking-related metabolic changes.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current **guidelines recommend aspirin for secondary prevention** [^1171F4iz] in smokers with established ASCVD and DOACs for AF or VTE [^113FL5uJ]. Smoking status alone does not dictate antithrombotic therapy; decisions should be based on clinical indications, ischemic and bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors [^115doh8n].

---

## Risks and benefits of combining aspirin and DOACs in smokers

Combining aspirin and DOACs **increases bleeding risk** [^116qZRRN] without clear additional benefit unless a specific indication exists (e.g. recent ACS with AF or mechanical heart valve). Therefore, in smokers, avoid combination therapy unless clearly indicated.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

- **Cardiovascular risk profile**: High-risk smokers with established ASCVD benefit from aspirin [^1171F4iz]; those with AF or VTE benefit from DOACs [^113FL5uJ].
- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk may favor aspirin alone [^1171F4iz] or careful DOAC selection [^1165bg7H].
- **Comorbidities**: AF or VTE necessitate DOACs [^113FL5uJ]; established ASCVD without AF/VTE favors aspirin [^1171F4iz].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Although smoking increases thrombotic risk [^117H99sH], **antithrombotic therapy should be based on clinical indications and risk assessment** [^115doh8n]. Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention in smokers with established ASCVD [^1171F4iz], while DOACs are indicated for AF or VTE [^113FL5uJ]. Combination therapy should be avoided unless clearly indicated because of the increased bleeding risk [^116qZRRN].

### Adverse events associated with the addition of aspirin to direct oral anticoagulant therapy without a clear indication [^116qZRRN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is unclear how many patients treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) are using concomitant acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, or aspirin) and how this affects clinical outcomes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and outcomes of the prescription of concomitant ASA and DOAC therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).

This registry-based cohort study took place at four anticoagulation clinics in Michigan from January 2015 to December 2019. Eligible participants were adults undergoing treatment with a DOAC for AF or VTE, without a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or history of heart valve replacement, with at least three months of follow-up. The exposure of interest was the use of ASA concomitant with DOAC therapy.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Rates of bleeding (any, nonmajor, major), rates of thrombosis (stroke, VTE, MI), emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death.

Of the study cohort of 3,280 patients (1,673 [51.0%] men; mean [SD] age 68.2 [13.3] years), 1,107 (33.8%) patients without a clear indication for ASA were being treated with DOACs and ASA. Two propensity score-matched cohorts, each with 1,047 patients, were analyzed (DOAC plus ASA and DOAC only). Patients were followed up for a mean (SD) of 20.9 (19.0) months. Patients taking DOAC and ASA experienced more bleeding events compared with DOAC monotherapy (26.0 bleeds vs. 31.6 bleeds per 100 patient years, P = 0.01). Specifically, patients undergoing combination therapy had significantly higher rates of nonmajor bleeding.

### The ABCs of the 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease [^1171F4iz]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of aspirin use in lowering the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for secondary prevention in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is clear. The 2023 CCD Guideline recommends that for individuals with chronic coronary disease (CCD) who are not prescribed oral anticoagulants (OAC) for another indication, single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) is usually recommended with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg). This is to reduce the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

In addition, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining clopidogrel with low-dose aspirin in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), is recommended up to 12 months after the ACS, regardless of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or not. If aspirin is not well tolerated, clopidogrel is a reasonable alternative. There are contemporary trials that advocate for clopidogrel monotherapy following a short course of DAPT following PCI.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial investigated the use of low-dose rivaroxaban, with or without aspirin, in reducing ASCVD events. It demonstrated increased efficacy of combining rivaroxaban with aspirin over aspirin alone. Notably, those with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and at least one other condition like peripheral arterial disease or chronic kidney disease observed the most substantial absolute risk reduction from adding low-dose rivaroxaban to their aspirin regimen.

The 2023 CCD Guideline recommends that for those at elevated risk for re-ischemic episodes who do not have an indication for direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or DAPT, and have a low-to-intermediate risk of bleeding, the incorporation of low-dose rivaroxaban is advised.

### Xarelto [^1153sBjX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy and safety of Xarelto for the reduction in the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) was derived from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Cardiovascular Outcomes for People using Anticoagulation Strategies trial (COMPASS) [NCT10776424]. A total of 27,395 patients were evenly randomized to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg orally twice daily alone, or aspirin 100 mg once daily alone. Because the 5 mg dose alone was not superior to aspirin alone, only the data concerning the 2.5 mg dose plus aspirin are discussed below.

Patients with established CAD or PAD were eligible. Patients with CAD who were younger than 65 years of age were also required to have documentation of atherosclerosis involving at least two vascular beds or to have at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, diabetes mellitus, an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL per minute, heart failure, or non-lacunar ischemic stroke ≥ 1 month earlier). Patients with PAD were either symptomatic with an ankle brachial index < 0.90 or had asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%, a previous carotid revascularization procedure, or established ischemic disease of one or both lower extremities. Patients were excluded for use of dual antiplatelet, other non-aspirin antiplatelet, or oral anticoagulant therapies.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113FL5uJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In general, the FDA-approved indications for each of the DOACs are comparable. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are approved for lowering the risk of stroke and embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), as well as for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Unique indications include betrixaban for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with an acute medical illness, and rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease.

However, there is still uncertainty in understanding the safe and effective use of DOACs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. These include specifically atrial fibrillation (AF) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AF with concomitant artificial heart valves, stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and cancer-associated thromboembolism. This section aims to clarify the use of DOACs within these patient subgroups.

### Management of patients with stroke treated with direct oral anticoagulants [^115TuSTK]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Since their market approval, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been increasingly used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the management of DOAC-treated patients with stroke poses several challenges for physicians in everyday clinical practice, both in the acute setting and in long-term care. This has spurred extensive research activity in the field over the past few years, which we review here.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178FGGA]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of this study**: Strengths of this review include a comprehensive search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials; explicit eligibility criteria with a focus on populations most likely to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy; assessment of risk of bias; provision of important data not included in the published reports provided by the authors of the two large studies; use of the GRADE approach to determine our certainty in the evidence; and an innovative approach to creating a single incidence curve that informs the optimal duration for continuing clopidogrel from the two large studies. The consistent results across studies and the clear benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy on recurrent stroke without evidence of important adverse effects are likely to provide clear guidance for patients with high-risk TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and for the clinicians responsible for their care.

	- Our study has some limitations. The loading dose and treatment onset time differed among the three studies: CHANCE and FASTER used a smaller loading dose of clopidogrel compared with POINT (300 mg vs. 600 mg). This could leave clinicians with uncertainty as to which loading dose to choose. Our review does not address other populations of potential interest, including those who have experienced low-risk TIA and those with moderate to severe ischaemic stroke.

	- No trial compared clopidogrel with dual antiplatelet therapy and the addition of aspirin. It is possible that different categories of ischaemic stroke subtypes — small vessel disease, large vessel stenosis — were not fully addressed.

### Bleeding with direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin: Clinical experience [^112mijTx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The risk of bleeding in the setting of anticoagulant therapy continues to be re-evaluated following the introduction of a new generation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Interruption of DOAC therapy and supportive care may be sufficient for the management of patients who present with mild or moderate bleeding; however, in those with life-threatening bleeding, a specific reversal agent is desirable. We review the phase 3 clinical studies of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, in the context of bleeding risk and management.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^115doh8n]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute ischemic stroke, especially in terms of risk assessment, the AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend using the CHA2DS2-VASc score in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to guide decisions on the prescription of oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke.

### Impact of smoking on long-term outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease treated with aspirin or clopidogrel: Insights from the CAPRIE trial (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) [^117H99sH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to investigate the differential efficacy of clopidogrel or aspirin monotherapy according to smoking status in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. Smoking enhances clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition, which may explain the higher relative benefit among smokers observed in trials evaluating dual antiplatelet therapy. Whether smoking has an impact on clinical outcomes in patients requiring a single antiplatelet agent remains unknown.

This was a post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trial that compared clopidogrel and aspirin monotherapy in patients (N = 19,184) with atherosclerotic vascular disease.

- **Results**: Smokers (n = 5,688) had an increased risk of ischemic events compared with never smokers (n = 4,135; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08 to 1.42]) and ex-smokers (n = 9,381; HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.18 to 1.47]) (p < 0.001). Clopidogrel was associated with a reduction in ischemic events among smokers (8.3% vs. 10.8%; HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90]), whereas no benefit over aspirin was seen in the combined group of ex-smokers/never-smoked patients (10.4% vs. 10.6%; HR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.89 to 1.10]; p = 0.01 for interaction). Among smokers, clopidogrel also reduced myocardial infarction, vascular death, and death from any cause compared with aspirin. No interaction between smoking status and study treatment was observed for bleeding events.

In conclusion, this post-hoc analysis of the CAPRIE trial highlighted that clopidogrel may offer greater benefits to smokers in reducing ischemic events, myocardial infarction, vascular death, and death from any cause compared to aspirin, while smoking status did not influence bleeding events.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^112JWBZP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In March 2014, the American Heart Association updated their guidelines for the management of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in atrial fibrillation, recommending OAC for all patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2. Previously, only patients with CHADS₂ ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. This study compared effectiveness and safety outcomes of OAC among patients who would receive OAC using the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines.

- **Methods and results**: Using claims data from a 5% sample of 2013–2014 Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients with initially diagnosed atrial fibrillation between 2013 and 2014 and selected those who would receive OAC under the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines (those with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 or CHADS₂ score < 2). Patients were categorized according to their use of OAC after first atrial fibrillation diagnosis (2,937 users and 2,914 nonusers). Primary outcomes included the composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and death, and any bleeding event. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to compare the risk of primary outcomes between the two groups, while controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. There was no difference in the combined risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and death between the treatment groups (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.20). The risk of bleeding was higher for patients receiving OAC than for patients not receiving OAC (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–1.97).

- **Conclusions**: The benefit of OAC is not well defined in this population.

### Non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute myocardial infarction: a network meta-analysis [^111vJREL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Balancing the risk of bleeding and thrombosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is challenging, and the optimal antithrombotic therapy remains uncertain. The role of NOACs after AMI is not fully understood, and treatment decisions rely on limited evidence. European guidelines provide a class IIb recommendation (usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion) for considering the use of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BD, in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel, for people with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) who have high ischemic and low bleeding risks. Low-dose rivaroxaban may be suitable for selected people with low bleeding risk who receive aspirin and clopidogrel after ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (class IIb recommendation). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved rivaroxaban with either aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel as an option to avoid additional blood clots after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in people with high ischemic risk. NOACs have not been approved for ACS treatment in the United States and are therefore not recommended in the STEMI or NSTEMI guidelines.

This systematic review aims to assess the evidence for the safety and efficacy of NOACs after AMI to help establish the optimal level of anticoagulation and identify the patient group with the most favorable balance of benefit and risk associated with NOACs in combination with antiplatelets.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^112LG199]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

There are several limitations in this study that must be acknowledged. First, although PSM was used in this study, the retrospective assessment of drug efficacy is subject to inherent biases, such as potential between-group imbalance, which prevents definitive conclusions. Instead, the study should be considered a hypothesis-generating pilot study for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are warranted in the future.

Second, due to the relatively small sample size of this study, dividing patients into subgroups based on different cancer types representing different VTE risks would result in an inadequate sample size for each subgroup. Therefore, subgroup analysis based on cancer types was not conducted in the study.

Third, the follow-up procedures were not standardized across centers. This is common in retrospective studies and even in some multicenter prospective studies. Nevertheless, the basic principles for follow-up of patients with cancer-associated VTE in the medical centers were all in line with the guidelines.

Fourth, since most patients in the aspirin group had comorbidities of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, while those in the non-aspirin group did not, it is impracticable to eliminate this bias with PSM, as it would greatly reduce the sample size. It would be preferable to eliminate this confounding factor in future RCTs. However, apart from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities, other confounding factors were well matched between the two groups.

Fifth, the long-term aspirin use among the participants was not detailed in this excerpt.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115W6YhE]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation in addition to antiplatelet treatment after an acute coronary syndrome might reduce ischaemic events but increase bleeding risk. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding direct thrombin or factor-Xa inhibition by any of the novel oral anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, darexaban, rivaroxaban, and ximelagatran) to single (aspirin) or dual (aspirin and clopidogrel) antiplatelet therapy in this setting.

- **Methods and results**: All seven published randomized, placebo-controlled phase II and III studies of novel oral anticoagulants in acute coronary syndromes were included. The database consisted of 30,866 patients, 4,135 (13.4%) on single, and 26,731 (86.6%) on dual antiplatelet therapy, with a non-ST- or ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome within the last 7–14 days. We defined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) as the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and clinically significant bleeding as the composite of major and non-major bleeding requiring medical attention according to the study definitions. When compared with aspirin alone, the combination of an oral anticoagulant and aspirin reduced the incidence of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% confidence interval: 0.70; 0.59–0.84) but increased clinically significant bleeding (HR: 1.79; 1.54–2.09). Compared with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, adding an oral anticoagulant decreased the incidence of MACE modestly (HR: 0.87; 0.80–0.95) but more than doubled the bleeding (HR: 2.34; 2.06–2.66).

### Influence of sex on platelet reactivity in response to aspirin [^113r8cxh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were nearly identical for all four cohorts. Study participants were between the ages of 30 and 75 years, were either healthy or had the requisite preexisting medical comorbidity profile, did not have a history of a bleeding disorder, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or known prior gastric ulcer without documented resolution, did not have known severe hepatic impairment, had not undergone surgery within the past six months, had not undergone prior gastric bypass surgery that could interfere with study drug absorption, and did not have aspirin allergy or known intolerance to aspirin. Healthy volunteers could not be taking any prescription medications other than oral contraceptives, could not exhibit regular use of tobacco or nicotine products or any known active use of illicit substances, could not have a known pregnancy or be currently breastfeeding, and could not have previously participated or have had a first-degree relative who participated in prior aspirin studies. Patients in the diabetic and CAD cohorts were defined as having hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia based on the use of prescription antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, respectively. Patients who were already taking aspirin underwent a four-week washout period, with the approval of their primary care physician before enrollment in the study.

All patients were studied under similar experimental protocols developed centrally to ensure compliance with prescribed doses, including witnessed first and last doses.

### Low-dose direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention in patients at high risk for recurrence due to history of recurrent venous thromboembolic events or severe thrombophilia: A retrospective analysis of the Italian Survey on Anticoagulated Patients Registry 2 [^117DC67T]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Long-term anticoagulation is recommended in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) deemed at high risk for recurrence (HRR). Limited information is available on patients with recurrent VTE (reVTE) and/or severe thrombophilia. In addition, these patients were not included in studies evaluating long-term treatment with low doses of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).

- **Methods**: Among 2520 VTE patients enrolled in the START2 Registry, we retrospectively analyzed the management of patients with a history of reVTE and/or severe thrombophilia (HRR patients).

- **Objectives**: Aims of our study were to record drug and dosage used in HRR patients and to record adverse events occurring during follow-up.

- **Results**: 487 HRR patients were analyzed. Anticoagulants were stopped in 11 out of 487 patients (2.3%), full dose was continued in 176 patients (36.1%), and 311 patients (63.9%) were shifted to low-dose DOACs (61.4% with apixaban 2.5 mg bid and 38.6% with rivaroxaban 10 mg od) following a median time of 1.3 years (0.5–20.2). During follow-up, no adverse events were recorded in patients who stopped treatment. Among patients who continued treatment, 10 had reVTE (rate 0.4 x 100 pt-yrs) and 19 had bleeding (rate 0.9 x 100 pt-yrs). The risk of reVTE was similar between patients on full-dose anticoagulation and patients on low-dose. Patients on full dose had a trend towards higher bleeding risk (relative risk 2.2; 95% CI 0.7–9.0).

- **Conclusion**: HRR patients with a history of unprovoked reVTE and/or patients with severe thrombophilia treated with long-term low-dose DOACs showed specific outcomes, which require further detailed analysis for comprehensive understanding.

### Effect of smoking on comparative efficacy of antiplatelet agents: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect comparison [^116LbUna]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

From each study included in the analysis, we extracted information about the antiplatelet treatment group, the control treatment group, the definition of each clinical outcome, the definition of smoking subgroups, the number of patients in each smoking category, and hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for each subgroup-specific effect, or the information required to calculate these. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess whether studies were at low, high, or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, or reporting bias. Protocols and design and rationale papers associated with each study were consulted as needed when available. Two authors independently performed all data extraction in duplicate, and discrepancies were discussed until agreement was met.

### The role of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113su7Tg]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke and thromboembolism, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. For the majority of patients with AF, aspirin has a limited role in stroke prevention, being an inferior strategy and not necessarily safer than the anticoagulant warfarin, especially in the elderly. Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF.

Nonetheless, aspirin use should continue in the early stages following presentation of a patient with AF and acute coronary syndrome, and after stenting, in combination with oral anticoagulant drugs and clopidogrel, as appropriate. Notably, aspirin combined with clopidogrel shows only modest benefit in stroke prevention compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with AF who refuse oral anticoagulant drugs (including warfarin), or in those individuals who have difficulties in anticoagulation monitoring, and can be used where bleeding risk is not excessive.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UEpPj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The ASPIRE study, published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in The New England Journal of Medicine, examines the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) and are at high risk of recurrence after discontinuing anticoagulants.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 822 patients (375 female, 447 male). Inclusion criteria required patients to have completed initial anticoagulant therapy following a first episode of unprovoked VTE. Key exclusion criteria included a first unprovoked episode of VTE more than two years prior to enrollment, indications or contraindications for the use of aspirin, other antiplatelet therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indications for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy, or other medical problems that would impede participation or limit life expectancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Aspirin group**: 411 patients received 100 mg aspirin orally once daily for up to four years.
	- **Placebo group**: 411 patients received a matching placebo orally once daily for up to four years.

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE (reVTE) between groups; 4.8% per year vs. 6.5% per year (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05).

- **Secondary outcomes** included:
	- A significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events, 5.2% per year vs. 8% per year (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92).

### Are drug eluting stents worth triple therapy [^116vbiej]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Based on this literature demonstrating a clear bleeding risk with triple therapy without a clear benefit, and the guideline recommendations recommending limitation in duration of triple therapy, one would expect that BMS would be used in those with a very high risk of bleeding where there would be less of a need for antiplatelet therapy.

However, the results presented in this issue of JAHA suggest that practitioners do not share this concern. Vora et al. evaluated over 14,000 patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing acute percutaneous coronary intervention with acute myocardial infarction. Overall, DES was used in 59% of patients, and this increased over time from 47% in 2008 to 68% in 2014. Bleeding risk was measured using the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score calculated from hemoglobin less than 13 mg/dL (or 12 for females, 3 points), glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min (3 points), age 75 years or older (2 points), past hemorrhage (1 point), and history of hypertension (1 point). High-risk bleeding is a score of 5 points or greater, indicating a 6% annual risk of hemorrhage. Surprisingly, the 32% of patients at highest risk for bleeding (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score 4 or greater) were almost as likely to receive a DES (56%) as those at low risk (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score less than 4, 60% DES use). It appears that clinicians are not selecting stents (and the need for prolonged antiplatelet use) based on bleeding risk.

### Bleeding during treatment with aspirin versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation unsuitable for warfarin: the Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial [^114pWCvP]. Stroke (2012). High credibility.

Apixaban reduces stroke with comparable bleeding risks when compared with aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation who are unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. This analysis explores patterns of bleeding and defines bleeding risks based on stroke risk with apixaban and aspirin.

- **Methods**: The Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial randomized 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation and risk factors to receive either apixaban or aspirin. Bleeding events were defined as the first occurrence of either major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

- **Results**: The rate of a bleeding event was 3.8% per year with aspirin and 4.5% per year with apixaban (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.92–1.51; P = 0.19). The anatomic site of bleeding did not differ between therapies. Risk factors for bleeding common to apixaban and aspirin were the use of non-study aspirin > 50% of the time and a history of daily or occasional nosebleeds. The rates of both stroke and bleeding increased with higher CHADS2 scores, but apixaban compared with aspirin was associated with a similar relative risk of bleeding (P interaction 0.21) and a reduced relative risk of stroke (P interaction 0.37) irrespective of CHADS2 category.

- **Conclusions**: Anatomic sites and predictors of bleeding are similar for apixaban and aspirin in these patients. Higher CHADS2 scores are associated with increasing rates of bleeding and stroke, but the balance between risks is maintained.

### Synergy of dual pathway inhibition in chronic cardiovascular disease [^114p213m]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Although acetylsalicylic acid is of proven benefit for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease, the risk of recurrent ischemic events remains high. Intensification of antithrombotic therapy with more potent antiplatelet drugs, dual antiplatelet therapy, or vitamin K antagonists further reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with acetylsalicylic acid alone but increases the risk of bleeding without reducing mortality.

In patients with prior coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease, the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial revealed that compared with acetylsalicylic acid alone, dual pathway inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice-daily), an oral factor Xa inhibitor, plus acetylsalicylic acid reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 24%, major adverse limb events by 47%, and mortality by 18%. Major bleeding was increased by 70%, but there was no increase in fatal or intracranial bleeding.

This article reviews the results of the COMPASS trial, explains why dual pathway inhibition is superior to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone, compares the results with rivaroxaban plus aspirin with those of other antithrombotic regimens, and provides insight into how best to apply the COMPASS results into practice.

### Thienopyridine efficacy and cigarette smoking status [^114gVNiV]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker is an established regimen to reduce the risk of ischemic event occurrence in patients with high-risk cardiovascular (CV) disease. Cigarette smoking is an important cardiovascular risk factor. However, several investigators have reported what may be termed a "new" "smoker's paradox", whereby clopidogrel-treated nonsmokers appear to have either less or no CV-event reduction when compared to the substantial CV-event reduction in clopidogrel-treated smokers based on several large-scale trials.

This "smoker's paradox" observed in multiple clinical outcome studies is also supported by emerging "real-world" data that suggest clopidogrel nonsmokers do not fare as well as smokers treated with clopidogrel. In support of the new "smoker's paradox", pharmacodynamic studies have also shown that smoking status influences clopidogrel responsiveness in healthy volunteers, acute coronary syndrome patients, and patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.

Finally, there is a substantial, albeit not entirely consistent, body of pharmacodynamic and clinical outcome data supporting a reduced antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in nonsmokers compared to smokers. The clinical relevance of this interaction has never been demonstrated in a prospective trial. The focus of this review is to critically evaluate the reported interaction between cigarette smoking status and thienopyridine efficacy.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^115ahS4E]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Consider aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy for individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk (10-year risk > 10%). This includes most men over 50 years of age or women over 60 years of age who have at least one additional major risk factor such as family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria. Aspirin should not be recommended for CVD prevention in adults with diabetes who are at low CVD risk (10-year CVD risk < 5%), for example, men under 50 years and women under 60 years of age with no major additional CVD risk factors, since the potential adverse effects from bleeding likely offset the potential benefits. Clinical judgment is required for patients in these age groups with multiple other risk factors (e.g. 10-year risk 5–10%). Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a secondary prevention strategy in those with diabetes with a history of CVD. For patients with CVD who have a documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. Combination therapy with aspirin (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome.

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: A commentary [^111XyVVA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low-risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy.

After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention — oral anticoagulation therapy, whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants — could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last two years.

### Aspirin versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation: Decision analysis may help patients' choice [^113dGYc6]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

The primary prevention of ischemic stroke in chronic non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) typically involves consideration of aspirin or warfarin. CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc estimates annual stroke rates for untreated AF patients, which are reduced by 60% with warfarin and by 20% with aspirin. HAS-BLED estimates annual rates of major bleeding on warfarin. The latter risk with aspirin is 0.5–1.2% per year.

- **Hypothesis**: Given a 'warfarin, aspirin or no therapy' choice, AF patients will prefer the option that maximizes the annual probability of not having a stroke and not having a major bleed.

- **Methods**: Decision tree applied to the 60 possible combinations of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED scores.

- **Results**: According to the pre-specified hypothesis, when CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc is < 2, the balance of risk and benefit would advise no treatment. When CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc is 2 or 3, warfarin would be best when HAS-BLED < 2; otherwise, no treatment would be advised. For CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc = 4, warfarin would be best when HAS-BLED < 3; otherwise, no treatment would be advised. For CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ≥ 5, warfarin would be the preferred option if HAS-BLED < 4; otherwise, aspirin would be advised.

- **Conclusion**: This theoretical exercise illustrates the potential benefit of decision analysis in an area where high complexity and uncertainty still remain.

### The influence of smoking status on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel and prasugrel: The PARADOX study [^1158fBUw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). High credibility.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) of clopidogrel and prasugrel therapy.

Major randomized trial data demonstrated that nonsmokers experience less or no benefit from clopidogrel treatment compared with smokers, a phenomenon known as the "smokers' paradox".

PARADOX was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, crossover study of objectively assessed nonsmokers (n = 56) and smokers (n = 54) with stable coronary artery disease receiving aspirin therapy. Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or prasugrel (10 mg daily) for 10 days and crossed over following a 14-day washout. PD was assessed using VerifyNow P2Y12 and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assays. Clopidogrel and prasugrel metabolite levels, cytochrome P450 1A2 activity, CYP2C19 genotype, and safety parameters were determined.

During clopidogrel therapy, device-reported inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) trended lower in nonsmokers than smokers (least squares mean treatment difference ± SE: 7.7 ± 4.1%; p = 0.062). Device-reported IPA was significantly lower in clopidogrel-treated smokers than prasugrel-treated smokers (least squares mean treatment difference: 31.8 ± 3.4%; p < 0.0001). During clopidogrel therapy, calculated IPA was lower, and P2Y12 reaction units and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation and platelet reactivity index were higher in nonsmokers than in smokers (p = 0.043, p = 0.005, and p = 0.042, respectively).

### Does aspirin prevent venous thromboembolism [^1168joFP]. Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality in medical and surgical patient populations. Clinical research in the prevention and treatment of VTE has been dynamic, with investigations into various treatment modalities ranging from mechanical prophylaxis to direct oral anticoagulants.

Aspirin has long been an inexpensive cornerstone of arterial vascular disease therapy, but its role in the primary or secondary prophylaxis of VTE has been debated. Risk-benefit tradeoffs between aspirin and anticoagulants have changed, partly due to advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care, and partly due to the development of safe, easy-to-use oral anticoagulants.

- **Mechanisms of action**: We review the proposed mechanisms in which aspirin may act on venous thrombosis.
- **Evidence and risk analysis**: Consideration of the evidence for aspirin use in primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE and the risk of bleeding with aspirin compared to anticoagulation.

### Caldolor [^111trqds]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, with durations of up to three years, have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors have a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increased risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that the use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.

### Effect of smoking on comparative efficacy of antiplatelet agents: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect comparison [^114enSdN]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether smoking status is associated with the efficacy of antiplatelet treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular events, a systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect comparisons were conducted.

- **Data sources**: Searches were performed in Medline (1966 to present) and Embase (1974 to present), with supplementary searches in databases of abstracts from major cardiology conferences, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and the CAB Abstracts databases, and Google Scholar.

- **Study selection**: Randomized trials of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor were chosen if they examined clinical outcomes among subgroups of smokers and nonsmokers.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently extracted all data, including information on patient populations included in the trials, treatment types and doses, definitions of clinical outcomes and duration of follow-up, definitions of smoking subgroups, and the number of patients in each group. They also extracted effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each smoking status subgroup.

- **Results**: Of nine eligible randomized trials, one investigated clopidogrel compared with aspirin, four investigated clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone, and one investigated double dose compared with standard dose clopidogrel. These trials included 74,489 patients, of whom 21,717 (29%) were smokers. Among smokers, patients randomized to clopidogrel experienced a 25% reduction in the primary composite clinical outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with patients in the control groups (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval).

### Are COX-2 inhibitors preferable to non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with risk of cardiovascular events taking low-dose aspirin [^114pjhUp]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. Only aspirin offers primary and secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, but trials have not directly answered whether low-dose aspirin is cardioprotective with COX-2 inhibitors. A large inception cohort study showed that concomitant use of aspirin reduced the risk of cardiovascular events when given with rofecoxib, celecoxib, sulindac, meloxicam, and indometacin, but not when given with ibuprofen.

In large trials assessing gastrointestinal safety, there were fewer gastrointestinal events in patients using both COX-2 inhibitors and aspirin than in those using non-selective NSAIDs and aspirin; significantly fewer uncomplicated upper gastrointestinal events took place in the MEDAL trial. Analysis of VIGOR and two capsule endoscopy studies showed significantly less distal gastrointestinal blood loss with COX-2 inhibitors than with non-selective NSAIDs. Endoscopy trials showed that low-dose aspirin does not diminish the gastrointestinal benefits of COX-2 inhibitors over non-selective NSAIDs. In an elderly epidemiological cohort receiving aspirin, both celecoxib and rofecoxib reduced the risk of admission for gastrointestinal events.

Comparison of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks is difficult: the likelihood and severity of cardiovascular events differ between individuals, agents, and exposure. Mortality associated with gastrointestinal events is less frequent than with cardiovascular events, but asymptomatic ulcers are a concern.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^115EpuiT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Antiplatelet agents**: Consider aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy for individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk (10-year risk > 10%). This includes most men over 50 years of age or women over 60 years of age who have at least one additional major risk factor, such as family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria.

	- Aspirin should not be recommended for CVD prevention in adults with diabetes at low CVD risk (10-year CVD risk < 5%), such as men under 50 and women under 60 years of age without major additional CVD risk factors, since the potential adverse effects from bleeding likely offset the potential benefits.

	- In patients within these age groups with multiple other risk factors (e.g. 10-year risk 5–10%), clinical judgment is required.

	- Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a secondary prevention strategy in those with diabetes and a history of CVD.

	- For patients with CVD and documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used.

	- Combination therapy with ASA (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome.

### Should atrial fibrillation patients with 1 additional risk factor of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (beyond sex) receive oral anticoagulation [^111P7Fw1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Although the CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, female) score is recommended by both American and European guidelines for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF), the treatment recommendations for a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 are less clear.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with a single additional stroke risk factor (i.e. CHA2DS2-VASc score = 1 for males or 2 for females) and the impact of different component risk factors.

- **Methods**: We used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Among 186,570 AF patients not on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, we evaluated males with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 and females with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2. The clinical endpoint was the occurrence of ischemic stroke.

- **Results**: Among 12,935 male AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, 1,858 patients (14.4%) experienced ischemic stroke during follow-up (5.2 ± 4.3 years), with an annual stroke rate of 2.75%. Ischemic stroke risk ranged from 1.96% per year for men with vascular disease to 3.50% per year for those aged 65 to 74 years. For 7,900 females with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2, 14.9% experienced ischemic stroke, with an annual stroke rate of 2.55%. Ischemic stroke risk increased from 1.91% per year for women with hypertension to 3.34% per year for those aged 65 to 74 years.

- **Conclusions**: Not all risk factors in the CHA2DS2-VASc score carry an equal risk, with a significant variance observed based on specific factors and age groups.

### Eliquis [^11152cqz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In AVERROES, patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, who were considered not suitable candidates for warfarin therapy, were randomized to receive ELIQUIS 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily for selected patients) or aspirin 81 to 324 mg once daily. The primary objective of the study was to determine if ELIQUIS was superior to aspirin in preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. AVERROES was stopped early based on a prespecified interim analysis, which showed a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism with ELIQUIS compared to aspirin, albeit with a modest increase in major bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Anaprox DS [^1112Z6ww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, lasting up to three years, have demonstrated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it remains unclear if the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar across all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in individuals with and without known CV disease or its risk factors. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies have found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events can begin as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increased CV thrombotic risk is most consistently observed at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk of adverse CV events in NSAID-treated patients, it is recommended to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain vigilant for the development of such events throughout the treatment course, even in the absence of prior CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that the concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.

### Patient-tailored antithrombotic therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention [^113mPBAd]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Low-dose factor Xa inhibitor on top of antiplatelet therapy

Factor Xa inhibitors and other anticoagulants ultimately inhibit the formation or activation of thrombin, which plays a crucial role in both coagulation and platelet activation and may offer a synergistic benefit when added to antiplatelet therapy. A strong asset of dual-pathway inhibition is that anticoagulants, like factor Xa inhibitors, modulate a number of inflammatory pathways which may reduce their contribution to atherogenesis. Oral anticoagulants have been shown to mitigate the risk of arterial thrombotic events. However, because dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was superior to aspirin and warfarin in preventing stent thrombosis, the latter strategy was abandoned in favor of DAPT following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Recently reported studies investigating low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have renewed interest in combining lower anticoagulant doses with antiplatelet therapy.

In the placebo-controlled ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients mostly treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, at the expense of increased bleeding. Subsequently, in the COMPASS trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) on top of aspirin, as compared to aspirin alone, was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and peripheral artery disease at moderate-high risk of ischemic events. In high-risk subgroups (e.g. patients with diabetes, moderate chronic kidney disease), further findings are being evaluated.

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in cardiovascular disease [^112UasHC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Up to 10% of the more than 3 million Americans with atrial fibrillation will experience an acute coronary syndrome or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Therefore, conditions for multiple antithrombotic agents are a common clinical scenario. Although each agent helps reduce thrombotic risk, their combined use significantly increases the risk of major bleeding events, which can be life-threatening.

In the past 5 years, a number of randomized clinical trials have explored different combinations of anticoagulation plus antiplatelet agents aimed at minimizing bleeding risk while preserving low thrombotic event rates. In general, shorter courses with fewer antithrombotic agents have been found effective, particularly when direct oral anticoagulants are combined with clopidogrel. The combined use of very low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin has also demonstrated benefit in atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary and peripheral artery disease.

Use of proton pump inhibitor therapy while patients are taking multiple antithrombotic agents has the potential to further reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk in select populations. Applying this evidence to patients with multiple thrombotic conditions will help to avoid costly and life-threatening adverse medication events.

### Licart [^115Nip2J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, lasting up to three years, have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it remains unclear if the risk of CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline due to NSAID use appears similar in individuals with and without known CV disease or risk factors. However, patients with existing CV disease or risk factors exhibit a higher absolute incidence of serious CV thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies have discovered that this heightened risk begins as early as the first weeks of treatment, with the risk being most consistently noted at higher doses.

To minimize potential adverse CV events in NSAID-treated patients, it is advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration. Both physicians and patients should remain vigilant for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Additionally, patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the appropriate steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^111W1PGs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

In March 2014, the American Heart Association updated their guidelines for the management of oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation, recommending treatment for all patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2. Previously, only patients with a CHADS₂ score ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. This study compared the effectiveness and safety outcomes among patients who would receive anticoagulation using the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines.

- **Methods and results**: Using claims data from a 5% sample of 2013–2014 Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients with initially diagnosed atrial fibrillation between 2013 and 2014 and selected those who would receive anticoagulation under the 2014 guidelines but not the 2011 guidelines (those with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 or CHADS₂ score < 2). Patients were categorized according to their use of anticoagulation after first atrial fibrillation diagnosis (2937 users and 2914 nonusers). Primary outcomes included the composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, death, and any bleeding event. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to compare the risk of primary outcomes between the two groups, while controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. There was no difference in the combined risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and death between the treatment groups (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.20). The risk of bleeding was higher for patients receiving anticoagulation than for patients not receiving anticoagulation (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–1.97).

- **Conclusions**: The benefit of anticoagulation is not well defined in this patient population, and new studies that minimize residual confounding are needed.

### Aspirin and coumadin after acute coronary syndromes (the ASPECT-2 study): a randomised controlled trial [^114emPtf]. Lancet (2002). High credibility.

Antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and oral anticoagulants reduces the recurrence of ischemic events following a myocardial infarction. This study aimed to investigate which of these drugs is more effective in the long term after acute coronary events and whether the combination of aspirin and oral anticoagulants offers greater benefit than either of these agents alone, without excessive risk of bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a randomized open-label trial across 53 sites, we assigned 999 patients to low-dose aspirin, high-intensity oral anticoagulation, or a combination of low-dose aspirin and moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation. Patients were followed for up to 26 months. The primary composite endpoint was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death.

- **Findings**: The primary endpoint was reached in 31 (9%) of 336 patients on aspirin, in 17 (5%) of 325 on anticoagulants (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI 0.30–1.00], p = 0.0479), and in 16 (5%) of 332 on combination therapy (0.50 [0.27–0.92], p = 0.03). Major bleeding occurred in three (1%) patients on aspirin, three (1%) on anticoagulants (1.03 [0.21–5.08], p = 1.0), and seven (2%) on combination therapy (2.35 [0.61–9.10], p = 0.2). The frequency of minor bleeding was 5%, 8% (1.68 [0.92–3.07], p = 0.20), and 15% (3.13 [1.82–5.37], p = < 0.0001), respectively, in these groups. A total of 164 patients permanently discontinued the study drug. Analyses were conducted by intention to treat.

- **Interpretation**: In patients recently admitted with acute coronary events, treatment with high-intensity oral anticoagulants or aspirin with medium-intensity oral anticoagulation offers significant insights into their comparative effectiveness and safety.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^112QfLp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well-established and widely recommended by major clinical guidelines for indefinite use. In this setting, major ASCVD events are reduced by approximately 20% to 30%, but major bleeding increases by about 1.4 to 1.6-fold. In an effort to expand upon the ASCVD risk reduction witnessed with aspirin monotherapy, prior investigations evaluated more potent antiplatelets (i.e. clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and vorapaxar) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy as alternatives to aspirin and as add-on therapy with aspirin.

The recurring theme with these strategies was a slight reduction in ASCVD events, but at the expense of increased bleeding episodes and no effect on mortality. After promising results were indicated by combining antiplatelet therapy with low-dose rivaroxaban in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), investigations into the use of this strategy for chronic ASCVD were sought.

The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) study demonstrated that rivaroxaban plus aspirin had significant secondary prevention benefits for patients with ASCVD, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease, which led to FDA approval for this indication in 2018. Patients in the study were randomized to three treatment arms: rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with aspirin 100 mg daily; rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily alone; or aspirin 100 mg daily alone. This represents a significant dose reduction for rivaroxaban from the recommended 20 mg daily dose approved for other indications.

### Role of oral anticoagulants in patients after an acute coronary syndrome [^112xAT5A]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

After an acute coronary syndrome, patients continue to be at risk of adverse cardiovascular events despite treatment with the standard of antithrombotic therapy. The risk may be, in part, due to elevated thrombin levels following an acute coronary syndrome event. Several studies have investigated the utility of adding oral anticoagulation to post-acute coronary syndrome medical regimens, with the most promising results coming from the addition of low-dose oral direct anticoagulants. Focusing on optimal dosing strategies and applying therapies to the appropriate populations provide the ability to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way that they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain.

One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. A second is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, including direct oral anticoagulants: British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines [^112Fam36]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the standard of care in patients with ischemic heart disease. It reduces the mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction (MI) as well as the risk of fatal and non-fatal re-MI in patients with unstable coronary syndromes. It also reduces mortality and re-stroke in patients with acute cerebrovascular ischemia. When given as long-term secondary prevention, aspirin reduces vascular events by approximately one-third and vascular deaths by about one-sixth. Intra-platelet pathways can still be activated even in the presence of aspirin. Most patients who have suffered an acute coronary event will therefore be on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), that is, aspirin plus an inhibitor of the P2Y12 receptor, either clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor.

In the context of endoscopy, aspirin monotherapy has been found to be safe in colonoscopic polypectomy and endoscopic sphincterotomy. Studies of aspirin in the context of ESD or large (> 20 mm) colonic EMRs have found an increased risk of hemorrhage; EMR in the upper gastrointestinal tract confers a high risk of hemorrhage, but there are no studies on continuous aspirin therapy. The thrombotic risk to the patient should also be considered, particularly in those receiving aspirin for secondary prevention as they are at greater risk from discontinuation of therapy than those taking it for primary prevention. In patients on long-term low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention, aspirin interruption was associated with a three-fold increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^111Dw8YH]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The use of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate or high risk of stroke, estimated by established criteria, improves outcomes. However, to ensure that the benefits exceed the risks of bleeding, appropriate patient selection is essential. Vitamin K antagonism has been the mainstay of treatment; however, newer drugs with novel mechanisms are also available. These novel oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors, obviate many of warfarin's shortcomings, and they have demonstrated safety and efficacy in large randomized trials of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

However, the management of patients taking warfarin or novel agents remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations when selecting anticoagulant therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation. This review will discuss the rationale for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation; risk stratification for treatment; available agents; the appropriate implementation of these agents; and additional, specific clinical considerations for treatment.

### Effects of long-term, moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation in addition to aspirin in unstable angina. The organization to assess strategies for ischemic syndromes (OASIS) investigators [^113u9ULF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to evaluate whether oral anticoagulant (AC) therapy given for five months was superior to standard (control) therapy in patients with unstable angina receiving aspirin.

The long-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or death remains high in patients with unstable angina, despite the use of aspirin. Therefore, additional treatments are necessary.

Of the 10,141 patients entering the main trial, 3,712 were randomized 12 to 48 hours later to receive oral AC therapy (n = 1,848) or standard therapy (n = 1,864).

One hundred forty patients (7.6%) suffered from cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke while receiving oral AC compared with 155 patients (8.3%) on standard therapy (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 1.14; p = 0.40). The rates of the primary outcomes plus refractory angina were 16.7% (n = 308) versus 17.5% (n = 327) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.11; p = 0.53).

Countries were divided into good or poor compliers based on the use of oral AC above or below 70% at 35 days, without knowledge of results by country. In good-complier countries, oral AC was discontinued in only 10.4% of patients at seven days and in 23.6% by five months, compared with 27.6% and 44.9%, respectively, in poor complier countries. There were significant reductions in the risks of both the primary (6.1% vs. 8.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; p = 0.02) and secondary outcomes (11.9% vs. 16.5%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90; p = 0.005) with oral AC in the good-complier countries.

### More, more, more: Reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^117JW4UR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

Direct oral thrombin (FIIa) inhibition involves the use of anticoagulants that act by directly inhibiting thrombin to delay clotting. The efficacy and safety of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran were evaluated in the RE-DEEM study (Randomized Dabigatran Etexilate Dose Finding Study in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes Post Index Event With Additional Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Complications Also Receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel: Multi-centre, Prospective, Placebo-Controlled, Cohort Dose Escalation Study). This phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1,861 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) assessed the addition of different doses of dabigatran (50, 75, 110, and 150 mg BID) to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) that included clopidogrel.

Dabigatran dose-dependently increased major bleeding compared with placebo (P < 0.001) but did not reduce the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonhemorrhagic stroke compared with placebo (4% versus 3.8%; P value not significant). Consequently, dabigatran has no role in ACS and currently is not indicated for patients on DAPT due to a doubling of major bleeding risk, as noted in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.

A meta-analysis of seven randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II and III studies of different non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (including FXa inhibitors such as apixaban, darexaban, rivaroxaban, and FIIa inhibitors such as dabigatran and ximelagatran) in ACS showed that the addition of a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant to DAPT for six months prevented five major events.

### Aspirin versus p2y inhibitors with anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation [^111yYX34]. Heart (2021). High credibility.

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) can be treated with multiple antithrombotic therapies, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies; however, this has the potential to increase bleeding risk. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin in patients also receiving anticoagulant therapy.

We evaluated patients from the Atrial Fibrillation and Ischaemic Events with Rivaroxaban in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease (AFIRE) trial who received rivaroxaban plus an antiplatelet agent; the choice of antiplatelet agent was left to the physician's discretion. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints, consistent with those of the AFIRE trial, were compared between P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria.

A total of 1075 patients were included (P2Y12 inhibitor group, n = 297; aspirin group, n = 778). Approximately 60% of patients were administered proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and there was no significant difference in PPI use between the groups. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoints between the groups (efficacy: HR 1.31; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.94; p = 0.178; safety: HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.47; p = 0.456).

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^1139GoNi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the updated 2014 guidelines was to better distinguish between patients with moderate and low risk, which means that many more patients are now recommended to receive anticoagulation compared to before 2014. Specifically, two-thirds of patients not recommended for anticoagulation under the 2011 guidelines are now recommended for anticoagulant therapy under the 2014 guideline. For example, all women older than 64 years are now recommended for therapy regardless of risk profile. This guideline update was highly controversial because previous studies evaluating the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with low or low-to-moderate risk have yielded conflicting results. Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of anticoagulation in men with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 1 and women with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 2, whereas other studies have found that oral anticoagulation did not reduce the risk of stroke in this low-risk group but did increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, the publication of this guideline, which was based mostly on expert opinion rather than quantitative data, was followed by concerns regarding the strength of the evidence supporting this guideline update and the potential increase in the incidence of bleeding in this population.

To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has specifically evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of oral anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of US patients who are newly recommended for anticoagulation under the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline. To address this gap in literature, we…

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to primary prevention, the 2024 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend considering the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin in patients with established, stable coronary artery disease and low bleeding risk. This combination may extend beyond 12 months for up to 3 years to potentially reduce the rate of ischemic stroke.

### Low-dose anticoagulation for secondary prevention in acute coronary syndrome [^1168AsLa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), long-term dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y(12) platelet receptor antagonist is the standard of care for secondary prevention. Despite the introduction of more potent P2Y(12) receptor antagonists, the risk of a revascular event within 12 months remains at approximately 10%, indicating a need for improved secondary prevention strategies. A recent phase III trial found that the addition of a third antiplatelet agent, vorapaxar, for patients with atherosclerosis might benefit those who have previously experienced a myocardial infarction. However, a trial in patients with ACS found this strategy led to increased bleeding without significant efficacy improvement.

Previously, data from patients with ACS given vitamin K antagonists in addition to acetylsalicylic acid demonstrated significant reductions in vascular events but were associated with an unacceptable bleeding risk. As expected, phase II trials of newer oral anticoagulants in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy also found increased bleeding risk. Only the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban continued to phase III trials. The phase III trial of full-dose apixaban was stopped early for safety concerns, as the major bleeding rates were significantly increased with minimal improvement in efficacy. However, the phase III trial of low-dose rivaroxaban demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of revascular events without an increased risk of fatal bleeding.

In conclusion, these trials underline the potential importance of optimizing anticoagulation strategies in the setting of ACS.

Aspirin has potential benefits in cardiovascular primary prevention in diabetes, but these may be counterbalanced by an increased bleeding risk. There are suggestions of differential effects of aspirin on cardiovascular outcomes by treatment dosage and duration as well as smoking status, but more data is required. The use of low-dose aspirin may need to be individualized and based on each individual's baseline CVD and bleeding risk.

### Double-dose versus standard-dose clopidogrel according to smoking status among patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^113Y6qns]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The patients were randomized by a 24-hour central automated voice response system using permuted block randomization stratified by center. A statistician set up a computer-generated random allocation sequence for the data safety and monitoring board. For the clopidogrel dose allocation, patients, those performing the interventions, those evaluating events, and those analyzing the data were masked to the group assignment. The aspirin dose allocation was open-label, with blinded adjudication of outcomes.

After randomization and prior to cardiac catheterization, patients randomly allocated to double-dose clopidogrel received a 600-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 150 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Those assigned to standard-dose clopidogrel received a 300-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2 to 7. Subsequently, on days 8 to 30, both groups received 75 mg once daily.

All participants received a loading dose of aspirin (≥ 300 mg) on day 1. On days 2 to 30, patients randomly allocated to low-dose aspirin received 75 to 100 mg daily, whereas those allocated to high-dose aspirin received 300 to 325 mg daily. The administration of vitamin K antagonists concurrently with the study drugs during the first 7 days was strongly discouraged. Other therapies, including anticoagulants, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, and the use of applied stents, were left to the discretion of the treating physician.

The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke from randomization.

### Narrative review: Aspirin resistance and its clinical implications [^117AkHU1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aspirin is currently the most cost-effective drug for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but treatment failures are relatively common. Several factors have been linked to these vascular events in patients prescribed aspirin, including smoking, drug interactions, nonadherence, comorbid conditions, and aspirin resistance. The term "aspirin resistance" has been used to describe not only an absence of the expected pharmacologic effects of aspirin on platelets but also poor clinical outcomes, such as vascular events, in patients treated with aspirin.

Aspirin resistance is perhaps more precisely understood as the phenomenon of measurable, persisting platelet activation that occurs in patients prescribed a therapeutic dose of aspirin and may underlie an unknown proportion of aspirin treatment failures. Key challenges for future research include standardizing a definition of aspirin resistance and comparing whether different measures of platelet activation, either alone or in combination, independently predict cardiovascular events. These challenges must be met before researchers conduct studies to assess the clinical utility of testing on patient outcomes and cost-effective prescribing.
