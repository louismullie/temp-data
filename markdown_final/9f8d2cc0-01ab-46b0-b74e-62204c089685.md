## Question

Can emtricitabine be used to treat Crohn's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using emtricitabine to treat Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about emtricitabine's approved indications and mechanism of action. Then, I should review guideline-directed therapy for Crohn's disease to see where, if anywhere, an antiretroviral might fit. Next, I will compare mechanistic plausibility between emtricitabine and established Crohn's therapeutics. After that, I should check safety considerations that could impact gastrointestinal disease. Finally, I will synthesize whether any evidence or recommendations support using emtricitabine in Crohn's disease and conclude with a clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its labeling so I don't jump to conclusions: emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of HIV-1 in combination regimens and used in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis; it is not indicated for inflammatory bowel disease, and labeling documents and SPL entries consistently confine its use to HIV prevention/treatment contexts and related HBV co-infection situations in HIV, not Crohn's disease or other autoimmune conditions [^112eWgCH] [^116P1Kji] [^114fQj5i].

> Next, I should review what guideline-directed therapy for Crohn's looks like to see if I am missing any niche use; the 2024 ECCO therapeutic guidelines outline induction and maintenance with anti-TNF agents, anti-IL-12/23 or anti-IL-23 biologics, anti-integrin therapy, and JAK inhibition, and for fistulizing disease, prioritize infliximab, with no mention of antiretrovirals such as emtricitabine anywhere in the treatment algorithm [^116844x1] [^113PdQFh] [^1117cVxG].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism-to-disease match before concluding; emtricitabine's action is inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase via its triphosphate active metabolite leading to chain termination, which addresses viral replication rather than the dysregulated cytokine and trafficking pathways central to Crohn's pathophysiology, so there is no mechanistic rationale for emtricitabine to modulate gut mucosal inflammation in Crohn's [^1138KiSm] [^111MChRp].

> I will now examine safety signals that might matter in IBD because even if it doesn't treat Crohn's, it could theoretically worsen symptoms; common adverse effects include abdominal pain and diarrhea, with serious risks such as lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, and renal clearance requires dose adjustments in kidney impairment, all of which could complicate a Crohn's clinical course rather than improve it [^111xLE67] [^111WXjKo] [^111TJFCK].

> Wait, let me double-check whether any trials or guidelines hint at utility in Crohn's; I find no randomized trials, cohort series, or consensus recommendations supporting emtricitabine for Crohn's induction, maintenance, or fistula management, and multiple ECCO pathways consistently omit antiretrovirals, reinforcing that there is neither evidence nor consensus for such use [^116844x1] [^115Ge5t2] [^11699iQP].

> But wait, what if I'm overlooking an antiviral-immunomodulatory crossover like with some off-target effects; on reconsideration, unlike immunomodulators or targeted biologics used in Crohn's, emtricitabine lacks known anti-cytokine, anti-integrin, or JAK pathway effects, so that hypothetical bridge is not supported pharmacologically or clinically [^1138KiSm] [^1117cVxG].

> Synthesizing this, I should conclude clearly: emtricitabine cannot be used to treat Crohn's disease because it has no immunomodulatory mechanism relevant to IBD, no clinical evidence supporting efficacy, and no endorsement by authoritative guidelines for any Crohn's indication [^112eWgCH] [^116844x1].

> Clinically, I recommend adhering to guideline-directed Crohn's therapy such as anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab or risankizumab, vedolizumab, and upadacitinib as appropriate to phenotype and severity, reserving infliximab for complex perianal fistulizing disease, and avoiding repurposing emtricitabine in this context; if the patient also has HIV, manage HIV per antiretroviral guidelines in parallel while treating Crohn's per ECCO algorithms, but do not expect emtricitabine to impact Crohn's disease activity [^113PdQFh] [^1117cVxG] [^116844x1].

---

Emtricitabine is **not indicated or effective** for Crohn's disease [^112eWgCH]. It is an antiretroviral for HIV/HBV with no anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory activity relevant to Crohn's disease [^11749eFK] [^111MChRp]. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for its use in Crohn's disease and therefore it should not be used for this purpose [^116844x1] [^1117cVxG].

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile

Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) [^112eWgCH] [^111MChRp] that inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in viral DNA chain termination [^1138KiSm]. It has **no known effects on inflammatory pathways** or immune modulation relevant to Crohn's disease [^11749eFK].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for emtricitabine in Crohn's disease [^116844x1]. The ECCO 2024 guidelines recommend anti-TNF agents [^111Vzida], ustekinumab, risankizumab, vedolizumab [^1117cVxG], and JAK inhibitors [^11699iQP] [^113agvC5] for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease; emtricitabine is not mentioned.

---

## Safety considerations

Emtricitabine has a favorable safety profile for HIV/HBV; however, using it for Crohn's is unsupported and could expose patients to **unnecessary risks** [^1161gaVB], including lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis [^111WXjKo], and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

---

## Alternative therapies for Crohn's disease

Evidence-based therapies for Crohn's include [^116844x1]:

- **Anti-TNF agents**: Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab [^111Vzida].
- **Other biologics**: Ustekinumab, risankizumab, vedolizumab [^1117cVxG].
- **JAK inhibitors**: Upadacitinib [^11699iQP] [^113agvC5].
- **Immunomodulators**: Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate [^112NnBry] [^1124nWbV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Emtricitabine is **not indicated or effective** for Crohn's disease and should not be used for this purpose [^112eWgCH]. Clinicians should use **evidence-based therapies** [^116844x1] and follow **current guidelines** for Crohn's management [^1117cVxG].

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^1134Ymxr]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a complex chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal condition with variable age of onset, disease location, and behavior. There is no single unifying definition of Crohn's disease, and a combination of investigative modalities is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. The most widely accepted framework for making a diagnosis dates back nearly 30 years. Factors include an appropriate clinical history and examination, ileocolonoscopy, small bowel imaging, blood tests, and histology. Mucosal biopsies from endoscopic procedures or surgical resection specimens show focal or patchy (rather than diffuse) inflammation and/or crypt distortion. Discontinuous segments of disease ('skip lesions'), ileal involvement, and granulomatous inflammation are more suggestive of Crohn's disease, as is a tendency for inflammation to be worse in the proximal colon.

Distinguishing between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) can sometimes be complicated. Partially-treated UC can demonstrate patches of inflammation, while backwash ileitis occurs in UC, and granulomas only occur in about half of Crohn's disease patients. Cryptolytic granulomas can occur in UC, diverticular inflammation, and all forms of colitis and are very non-specific. Pathologists find it easier to distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-IBD than they do to separate Crohn's from UC. The diagnosis is greatly aided by discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting with clinicians and pathologists present. Studies have shown about 3% of UC patients will be reclassified as Crohn's colitis.

### Recent advances in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV [^111MHMaX]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — the use of antiretroviral drugs by non-infected people to prevent the acquisition of HIV — is a promising preventive option, important public health questions remain. Daily oral emtricitabine (FTC)-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is highly efficacious in preventing the acquisition of HIV in people at risk due to various types of sexual exposure. There is good evidence of efficacy in women and men, and for men who have sex with men using event-based dosing. Studies have been conducted in several countries and epidemic settings.

Because adherence to this treatment varies greatly, questions arise regarding its public health benefit. Oral FTC-TDF is extremely safe, with minimal impact on kidney, bone, or pregnancy outcomes; there is no evidence that its effectiveness diminishes due to risk compensation during open-label and programmatic follow-up. It is too early to assess the impact of this treatment on the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at a population level.

Many challenges remain. Access to pre-exposure prophylaxis is limited and disparities exist, including those governed by race and sex. Different pricing and access models need to be explored to prevent further widening of inequalities. The optimal combination prevention program must be defined based on local epidemiology, service provision, and cost-effectiveness. This review updates the evidence base for pre-exposure prophylaxis regarding its effectiveness, safety, and risk compensation.

### Challenges and opportunities for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in the prevention of HIV infection: Where are we in Europe [^115JzMpC]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a vital strategy in the prevention of HIV infection. In Europe, significant challenges and opportunities exist regarding its implementation.

- **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: PrEP has demonstrated efficacy through various studies, including the iPrEx, IPERGAY, and PROUD trials. These studies highlight the potential reduction in HIV incidence among high-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Barriers to widespread adoption include cost considerations, limited awareness, and potential stigma associated with daily medication use.

- **Authorities and guidelines**: While organizations like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved medications like Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC) for PrEP, regulatory hurdles differ across countries within Europe. This creates inconsistencies in availability and protocols.

- **Cost-effectiveness and accessibility**: Assessments often consider the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained through PrEP. Policymakers must weigh these costs against the significant health benefits and potential long-term savings stemming from averted HIV infections.

- **Future directions**: Researchers continue to explore alternative methods and regimens to improve adherence and minimize side effects. Efforts also focus on integrating PrEP with broader public health initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and promoting antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those living with HIV.

Overall, expanding the use of PrEP in Europe requires addressing these challenges through coordinated efforts by healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring for current and investigational inflammatory bowel disease treatments [^115ydLMC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The metabolism of AZA and 6-MP is a complex multienzyme process. If the prodrug AZA is administered, it is first metabolized to 6-MP by glutathione S-transferase. There are then three main pathways:

- **Activation to 6-TGN**: This occurs by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, and guanosine monophosphate synthetase.
- **Inactivation to 6-thiouric acid**: This process involves xanthine oxidase.
- **Inactivation to 6-MMP or 6-MMP ribonucleotides**: This occurs through TPMT.

Xanthine oxidase is almost absent in erythrocytes and most likely other hematopoietic tissues, meaning that inactivation in these cells occurs by TPMT methylation only. TPMT activity, therefore, correlates inversely with 6-TGN levels. Although 6-TGN is thought to be the metabolite responsible for therapeutic benefit, its incorporation into DNA and low TPMT activity have been associated with myelosuppression.

The metabolism of thiopurines varies between individuals due to the involvement of multiple enzymes and, partially, due to genetic variation. Various polymorphisms of the TPMT gene have been described, leading to different levels of enzyme activity. TPMT polymorphisms have also been associated with hematotoxicity and, in particular, neutropenia. Furthermore, high TPMT activity and the consequent accumulation of 6-MMP can cause hepatotoxicity. Genotyping or phenotyping of TPMT is therefore recommended before the initiation of treatment to identify patients with intermediate levels of TPMT activity, who may require a dose reduction to minimize the risk of myelotoxicity, and those with low TPMT activity, who are ineligible for treatment.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in Crohn's disease [^115AvhoT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition, and maintenance of remission is a major issue as many patients fail to achieve remission with medical management and require surgical interventions. Purine analogues, such as azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), have been used to maintain surgically-induced remission in CD; however, the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of these agents remain controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of purine analogues (AZA and 6-MP) for the maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.

- **Search methods**: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 26 July 2018, and from inception to 31 July 2019. In addition, we searched reference lists of all included studies, relevant reviews, conference proceedings, and trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of at least three months that enrolled adults and children with surgically-induced remission of CD and compared AZA or 6-MP to no treatment, placebo, or any other active intervention were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcome was clinical relapse. Secondary outcomes included endoscopic relapse, radiologic and surgical relapse, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs, and health-related quality of life.

### Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^113h2vda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease were conflicting and controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine in inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.

- **Search strategy**: Studies were selected using the MEDLINE database (1966 to July 2009), abstracts from major gastrointestinal meetings, and references from published articles and reviews. The Cochrane Trials Register and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Trials Register were also searched. This search strategy was updated using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases, as well as the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine involving adult patients (> 18 years) with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by three independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Each study was given a quality score based on predetermined criteria. Extracted data were converted to 2X2 tables (response versus no response and antimetabolite versus placebo) and then synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence.

### Symtuza [^11256Fq2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Emtricitabine: Emtricitabine was administered orally to pregnant mice and rabbits (up to 1000 mg/kg/day) through organogenesis (on GD 6 through 15, and 7 through 19, respectively). No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo-fetal toxicity studies performed with emtricitabine in mice at exposures approximately 88 times higher and in rabbits approximately 7.3 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose of emtricitabine in Symtuza.

In a pre/postnatal development study, mice were administered doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day; no significant adverse effects directly related to the drug were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures of approximately 88 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose of emtricitabine in Symtuza.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF): TAF was administered orally to pregnant rats (up to 250 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (up to 100 mg/kg/day) through organogenesis (on GD 6 through 17, and 7 through 20, respectively). No adverse embryo-fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at TAF exposures approximately similar to (rats) and 85 times higher (rabbits) than the exposure in humans at the recommended daily dose. TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir; the observed tenofovir exposure in rats and rabbits were 51 (rats) and 80 (rabbits) times higher than human tenofovir exposures at the recommended daily dose of TAF in Symtuza.

Since TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir, and a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice was observed after TAF administration, further implications are being studied.

### Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^116MjARk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease have been conflicting and controversial. An updated meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 30 October 2015. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine compared to placebo or active therapy involving adult patients with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by two independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes of interest included clinical remission, clinical improvement, fistula improvement or healing, steroid sparing, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

- **Main results**: Thirteen RCTs (n = 1211 patients) were included.

### Tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and efavirenz vs. zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz for HIV [^113NnP7Y]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Durable suppression of replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends on the use of potent, well-tolerated antiretroviral regimens to which patients can easily adhere.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, noninferiority study involving 517 patients with HIV infection who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF), emtricitabine, and efavirenz once daily (tenofovir-emtricitabine group) or a regimen of fixed-dose zidovudine and lamivudine twice daily plus efavirenz once daily (zidovudine-lamivudine group). The primary end point was the proportion of patients without baseline resistance to efavirenz whose HIV RNA level was less than 400 copies per milliliter at week 48 of the study.

- **Results**: Through week 48, significantly more patients in the tenofovir-emtricitabine group reached and maintained the primary end point of less than 400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter compared to those in the zidovudine-lamivudine group (84 percent vs. 73 percent, respectively; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 4 to 19 percent; P = 0.002). This difference excludes the inferiority of the tenofovir DF, emtricitabine, and efavirenz regimen, indicating a significantly greater response with this regimen. Significant differences were also seen in the proportion of patients with HIV RNA levels of less than 50 copies per milliliter (80 percent in the tenofovir-emtricitabine group vs. 70 percent in the zidovudine-lamivudine group).

### A pill for HIV prevention: Déjà vu all over again [^114dnwzh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Recent FDA approval of tenofovir-emtricitabine for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has led to concern about implementation of this strategy. Fifty years ago, a very similar national and international debate occurred when the oral contraceptive pill ("the Pill" or "OCP") was approved. Contentious issues included OCP safety, cost, and the potential impact on sexual behavior — many of the same concerns being voiced currently about PrEP. In this article, we review the social and medical history of OCP, drawing parallels with the PrEP debate.

- **Key differences**: We also explore the key areas where PrEP differs from its forbear: lower efficacy, presence of drug resistance, and a more circumscribed (and marginalized) target population.

A thoughtful approach to PrEP implementation, bearing in mind the historical insights gained from the 1960s, might serve us well as we begin this new chapter in the control of the HIV epidemic.

### Penetration of tenofovir and emtricitabine in mucosal tissues: Implications for prevention of HIV-1 transmission [^111rqEsh]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A mainstay of strategies to prevent HIV-1 transmission is to use antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Critical to the design and interpretation of PrEP prevention trials is the ability to make accurate pharmacological measurements of ART drugs in human genital and colorectal mucosal tissues, the principal route of HIV transmission. Here, we evaluated two drugs that are preferentially used for PrEP: tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). A single oral dose of TDF/FTC (Truvada) was administered to 15 healthy individuals.

Over the next 14 days, TFV and FTC were measured in blood plasma and genital secretions using a sensitive assay (lower level of quantification, 0.1 ng/ml). The active intracellular phosphorylated metabolites of these drugs [TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and FTC triphosphate (FTC-TP)] were measured in homogenates prepared from rectal, vaginal, and cervical tissues. TFV and FTC were detected in blood plasma 14 days after administration of a single dose. The area under the concentration-time curve from 24 hours to 14 days (AUC(1–14d)) for FTC in genital secretions was 27-fold greater than in blood plasma, whereas the AUC(1–14d) for TFV was only 2.5-fold greater in genital secretions than in blood plasma.

In rectal tissue, TFV and TFV-DP concentrations were detectable for 14 days and were 100-fold higher than the concentrations in vaginal and cervical tissues. Vaginal and cervical tissue concentrations of FTC were 10- to 15-fold higher than in rectal tissue.

### Efficacy and safety of emtricitabine vs stavudine in combination therapy in antiretroviral-naive patients: a randomized trial [^1112biK6]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Emtricitabine is a new, once-daily nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

To assess efficacy and safety, emtricitabine was compared with stavudine when used with a background regimen of didanosine and efavirenz in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study conducted at 101 research clinics across North America, Latin America, and Europe. Patients were 571 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected adults aged 18 years or older with viral load levels greater than or equal to 5000 copies/mL. The first patient was enrolled on August 21, 2000. No investigator or patient was unblinded until the last patient randomized completed the week 48 visit on October 24, 2002. Analyses were based on data collected in a double-blind setting, with a median follow-up of 60 weeks.

- **Interventions**:
	- Receipt of either 200 mg of emtricitabine once daily (plus stavudine placebo twice daily) (n = 286) or stavudine at standard doses twice daily (plus emtricitabine placebo once daily) (n = 285) plus open-label didanosine and efavirenz, once daily.

- **Main outcome measure**:
	- Persistent virological response, defined as achieving and maintaining viral load at or below the limit of assay quantification (≤ 400 or 50 copies/mL).

At the interim analysis on June 14, 2002, when the last patient randomized completed 24 weeks of double-blind treatment (median follow-up time of 42 weeks), patients in the emtricitabine group had a higher probability of a persistent virological response.

### Editorial commentary: Comparative efficacy of lamivudine and emtricitabine: comparing the results of randomized trials and cohorts [^112bs32F]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In light of these methodological limitations and the large discrepancy between the results reported by Rokx et al. and those provided by prospective randomized controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the observed treatment differences are the result of study design rather than actual differences in efficacy between lamivudine and emtricitabine. Although many cohort studies and randomized trials result in similar effect estimates, it is not possible to know whether a cohort study is robustly valid until a randomized trial is conducted.

- **Figure 1**: Relative risk of virological failure at 48 weeks comparing lamivudine and emtricitabine. Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.

The authors of the ATHENA cohort suggest that additional randomized trials are needed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of lamivudine and emtricitabine. We agree that such evidence would be valuable. If future trials find important differences between these two drugs, then this evidence should be interpreted in light of the three completed randomized trials, and may have implications for future guidelines. In the meantime, on the basis of the currently available randomized evidence, we conclude that lamivudine and emtricitabine can be considered to be interchangeable.

### Remicade [^115WT2L2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in a randomized, open-label study (Study Peds Crohn's) involving 112 pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD) and an inadequate response to conventional therapies. The median age was 13 years, and the median Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) was 40 (on a scale of 0 to 100). All patients were on a stable dose of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (AZA), or methotrexate (MTX); 35% were also receiving corticosteroids at baseline.

All patients received induction dosing of 5 mg/kg Remicade at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. At Week 10, 103 patients were randomized to a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg Remicade administered either every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks.

- **Clinical response and remission at Week 10**: At Week 10, 88% of patients were in clinical response (defined as a decrease from baseline in the PCDAI score of ≥ 15 points and total PCDAI score of ≤ 30 points), and 59% were in clinical remission (defined as a PCDAI score of ≤ 10 points).

The proportion of pediatric patients achieving clinical response at Week 10 compared favorably with the proportion of adults achieving a clinical response in Study Crohn's I. The study definition of clinical response in Study Peds Crohn's was based on the PCDAI score, whereas the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score was used in the adult Study Crohn's I.

- **Clinical response in treatment groups**: At both Week 30 and Week 54, the proportion of patients in clinical response was greater in the every 8-week treatment group than in the every 12-week treatment group (73% vs. 47% at Week 30, and 64% vs. 33% at Week 54).

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^114GBzmF]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

The guidelines discuss the important aspect of **drug monitoring for thiopurines**. Thiopurine metabolites, specifically thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and methylmercaptopurine (MeMP), can be utilized to optimize drug dosing. It is suggested that metabolite monitoring may be beneficial for patients who exhibit inadequate response to therapy or experience toxicity; however, this should not replace routine monitoring blood tests (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence; Agreement: 92.9%).

The measurement of thiopurine metabolites offers an advantage over standard hematological and biochemical monitoring. It detects non-adherence to therapy, inadequate dosing, or unnecessarily high doses of thiopurines. Detection of a skewed metabolism, which leads to excessive thiopurine methylation, identifies patients at risk of poor response and hepatotoxicity.

One study indicates cost-effectiveness in metabolite monitoring for improving sustained response to thiopurines. Nevertheless, the benefit of routine measurement in all patients remains unclear due to significant variation in levels, as observed in a study reporting up to fivefold intra-patient variation. Although TGN levels of 230–400 pmol/8×10⁸ erythrocytes have been linked to better responses, and MeMP levels > 5000 pmol/8×10⁸ erythrocytes have been associated with increased liver toxicity, appropriate thresholds are yet to be determined, as small prospective studies have not demonstrated clinical benefit. In patients undergoing combination therapy with infliximab and thiopurines, a lower target TGN level of 125 pmol/8×10⁸ RBCs may suffice to achieve therapeutic infliximab levels.

### Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^111LPP9F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The results from controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease have been conflicting and controversial. An updated meta-analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of these drugs for the induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease.

- **Search methods**: A literature search for relevant studies (inception to June 13, 2012) was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine compared to placebo or active therapy involving adult patients with active Crohn's disease were selected for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by two independent observers based on the intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes of interest included clinical remission, clinical improvement, fistula improvement or healing, steroid sparing, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

### Regulatory considerations for antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent HIV acquisition [^116gdCeH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Antiretrovirals (ARVs) decrease the infectiousness of treated HIV-infected persons and can reduce the acquisition of HIV infection when taken by uninfected persons. Coformulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) is approved in the United States for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication, changing the regulatory landscape for new prophylactic agents. We describe the challenge of conducting rigorous clinical endpoint trials for prophylactic agents and point to alternatives that leverage new information about correlates of HIV risk and protection.

### Initiating azathioprine for Crohn's disease [^112NnBry]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine are therapeutic options for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory Crohn's disease. AZA has both a complex metabolism and potential for adverse events that can be clinically challenging. It has been shown to maintain remission and reduce corticosteroid use in patients with Crohn's disease. There is heterogeneous thiopurine methyltransferase metabolism among patients, which has implications for clinical dosing and risk for adverse events. Routine thiopurine methyltransferase testing before the initiation of AZA will reduce early leukopenia and is mandatory to avoid potentially life-threatening myelotoxicity. Thiopurine metabolite assays may aid in the assessment of adherence and adverse events. Patients who do not respond to AZA therapy may benefit from the addition of biologic therapy or methotrexate.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^111Pw2wq]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Cancer and treatment with biologics**: Biologics in the treatment of IBD are not completely contraindicated in patients with prior malignancy, and decisions should be individualised. A delay of at least 2 years after successful cancer eradication is appropriate, and this should be extended to 5 years for those cancers with a high risk of late metastatic spread (including breast, malignant melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma). Data from the New York Crohn's and Colitis Organisation for 333 IBD patients with a history of cancer, followed up for 5 years, did not show any differences in the rate of cancer-free survival between patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, immunomodulators, anti-TNF/thiopurine combination therapy, or no immunosuppression. Evidence related to malignancy in relation to IBD and its treatment is reviewed in recent ECCO guidance.

- **Withdrawal of immunosuppression for patients in sustained remission**:

	- **Stopping thiopurines**: We suggest that IBD patients in prolonged remission on thiopurines, who have mucosal healing, may stop the drug after discussion of risks and benefits and considering patient preference. Reintroduction if relapse occurs is usually successful (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.3%). A recent systematic review summarised the published data on thiopurine withdrawal in patients in clinical remission. Relapse rates were higher among patients randomised to withdrawal, and at 12 months ranged from 16.5% to 53% in Crohn's disease and from 11% to 77% in UC.

### Descovy [^115HSuN1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Indications and usage: Descovy is a two-drug combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), both HIV nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents:

- **HIV-1 treatment**: For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. Additionally, it is used in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg and less than 35 kg, in combination with antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors that require a CYP3A inhibitor.
- **HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Indicated for at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection from sexual acquisition, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. Individuals must have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating Descovy for HIV-1 PrEP.

Limitations of use: The indication does not include the use of Descovy in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex, as effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated.

### Emtricitabine, a new antiretroviral agent with activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus [^111cHnep]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Emtricitabine (FTC) is a new nucleoside agent that has activity against both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus. It is very similar to lamivudine (3TC) in terms of activity, convenience, safety, and resistance profile. With the exception of its longer intracellular half-life of triphosphate, there is little to distinguish between the two drugs.

Clinical trials comparing FTC with 3TC as part of a triple-drug regimen have demonstrated their equivalence, whereas a study comparing the activity of FTC with that of stavudine demonstrated FTC's superiority. In clinical practice, the choice between 3TC and FTC is likely to be made in the context of drugs coformulated with them. Although FTC is not formally approved for use in patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus, it is often a preferred choice for such patients when combined with tenofovir, which also has anti-hepatitis B virus activity.

Recent treatment guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection by both the International AIDS Society-USA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have placed FTC in combination with tenofovir, didanosine, or zidovudine in the preferred category of nucleoside backbone regimens for patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

### Methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^1124nWbV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Safe and effective long-term treatments that reduce the need for corticosteroids are essential for managing Crohn's disease. Although purine antimetabolites are moderately effective for maintaining remission, patients often relapse despite treatment with these agents. Methotrexate may offer a safe and effective alternative to more expensive maintenance treatments with TNF-α antagonists. This review updates a previously published Cochrane review.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review of randomized trials examining the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register were searched from inception to June 9, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared methotrexate to placebo or any other active intervention for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients maintaining clinical remission as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis). We calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

### Descovy [^1138KiSm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with hepatic impairment

- **Emtricitabine**: The pharmacokinetics of FTC have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, FTC is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes, so the impact of hepatic impairment should be limited.

- **Tenofovir alafenamide**: Clinically relevant changes in tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not observed in subjects with mild to moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus infection

The pharmacokinetics of FTC and TAF have not been fully evaluated in subjects infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus.

Drug interaction studies

The effects of coadministered drugs on the exposure of TAF are shown in Table 13, and the effects of Descovy or its components on the exposure of coadministered drugs are shown in Table 14. These studies were conducted with Descovy or the components of Descovy (FTC or TAF) administered alone. For information regarding clinical recommendations, see Drug Interactions (7).

Mechanism of action

- **Emtricitabine**: FTC, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and being incorporated into nascent viral DNA, which results in chain termination. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, Ɛ, and mitochondrial DNA poly.

### Safety and antiviral activity of emtricitabine (FTC) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection: a two-year study [^113TW8an]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and antiviral activity of different doses of emtricitabine given once daily to patients chronically infected with hepatitis B.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients were randomized in a double-blind, parallel study to evaluate 25, 100, or 200 mg once daily doses of emtricitabine for 48 weeks. Patients were then followed for an additional 48 weeks on open-label 200 mg emtricitabine. Serum HBV DNA, ALT, and hepatitis B serology were measured at regular intervals over the 2 years. Resistance surveillance was performed after 1 and 2 years on viremic samples, i.e. > 4700 copies/mL.

- **Results**: Emtricitabine was well-tolerated and produced a dose-proportional antiviral response. After 2 years, 53% of the patients had serum HBV DNA ≤ 4700 copies/mL, 33% seroconverted to anti-HBe, and 85% had normal ALT. Eighteen percent of the patients who had received 200 mg emtricitabine for 2 years developed resistance mutations.

- **Conclusions**: Emtricitabine was well-tolerated and demonstrated a potent antiviral response for up to 2 years in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Based on these data, 200 mg emtricitabine once daily was chosen as the optimal dose for future hepatitis B studies.

### Editorial commentary: Comparative efficacy of lamivudine and emtricitabine: comparing the results of randomized trials and cohorts [^114DtjJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS treatment and care have evolved toward simplifying recommendations for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) to promote a public health approach to treatment scale-up. Whereas in 2002, WHO recommended five different treatment options for first-line ART, the latest guidelines released in 2013 recommend a single first-line regimen comprising tenofovir, efavirenz, and either lamivudine or emtricitabine, preferably as fixed-dose combinations. These last two nucleoside analogues were recommended as interchangeable based on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, showing no difference in rates of virological suppression, virological failure, or the development of resistance mutations. Lamivudine is available from multiple generic sources and is cheaper than emtricitabine.

In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, an analysis from Rokx et al. and the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands nationwide HIV cohort (ATHENA) HIV treatment cohort in the Netherlands suggests better virological responses to emtricitabine compared with lamivudine as part of first-line ART. The authors of this nonrandomized cohort study conclude that using lamivudine instead of emtricitabine may result in additional morbidity and costs associated with virological failure and the development of drug resistance.

At the time of writing, three randomized clinical trials (n = 1242) have directly compared lamivudine and emtricitabine; the pooled results of these trials found no difference in efficacy.

### A mAb for the detection of the antiretroviral drug emtricitabine [^112kaVWP]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are the cornerstones of HIV prevention and elimination strategies, proving very effective when taken consistently. Antiretroviral regimens containing the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor emtricitabine (FTC) are widely used in first-line therapy of HIV-infected persons. Daily PrEP with the combination of FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is also recommended for HIV prevention in populations at risk for infection. Inadequate adherence to daily ART and PrEP has been shown to reduce effectiveness and public health benefit. Pharmacologic monitoring of adherence to these regimens provides an objective measurement of compliance and has been shown to predict the efficacy of PrEP.

Methods to measure drugs currently rely on complex analytical tests using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. These methods are costly, require skilled personnel, and are not feasible at point-of-care (POC) testing sites. Due to limitations in self-reporting and pill-counting methods for adherence monitoring, a direct method for measuring FTC levels provides an objective marker. This could significantly improve the ability of care providers to monitor and counsel adherence to ART and PrEP. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a simple, scalable, and inexpensive assay to detect antiretroviral drugs for adherence monitoring in people on PrEP and ART. Antibody-based tests, such as lateral flow diagnostic strips, allow for the development of POC assays capable of providing real-time results.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113zLV41]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

We recommend that thiopurines should be avoided in patients with low TPMT activity. The dose of thiopurine should be reduced to 50% in those with intermediate thiopurine activity. Daily dosage should also be reduced in patients with significant renal impairment. The usual dose of azathioprine is 2–2.5 mg/kg daily and for mercaptopurine 1–1.25 mg/kg daily for patients with normal TPMT activity. There is a very high risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression in patients with absent TPMT activity (homozygous or compound heterozygous TPMT deficiency). While a very low dose (5% of the usual target) has been proposed, a thiopurine should generally be avoided in this group. In those with heterozygous TPMT deficiency, however, 50% of the standard thiopurine dose is associated with improved tolerance.

Genetic variation in NUDT15 has now also been described in association with myelosuppression. This was originally described in East Asians but has now also been described in IBD patients of European ancestry. Recent CPIC guidelines recommend NUDT15 testing, particularly for Asian patients, with consideration of dose reduction or thiopurine avoidance.

- **Starting dose for thiopurines**: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine should be started at the full dose. There is no evidence that starting at low doses and then gradually increasing up to the target improves safety or tolerance, and low-dose initiation may cause significant delay in achieving the correct target dose.

### Tysabri [^115KWjsV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Drug interactions**: Because of the potential for increased risk of PML and other infections, Crohn's disease patients receiving Tysabri should not be treated with concomitant immunosuppressants (e.g. 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or methotrexate) or inhibitors of TNF-α. Corticosteroids should be tapered in those patients with Crohn's disease who are on chronic corticosteroids when they start Tysabri therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.6)]. Ordinarily, MS patients receiving chronic immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy should not be treated with Tysabri [see Indications and Usage (1.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.6)].

### Challenges and opportunities for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in the prevention of HIV infection: Where are we in Europe [^115uAL1V]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Following the US Food and Drug Administration's approval in July 2012 of daily oral tenofovir and emtricitabine for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection in high-risk individuals in the United States, there has been much controversy about the implementation of this PrEP regimen worldwide, and particularly in Europe. In this review, we focus on the challenges and opportunities of a daily oral PrEP regimen to curb the rising incidence of HIV infection in high-risk groups, particularly men who have sex with men. Several issues need to be addressed before PrEP implementation, including assessing the real effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of daily PrEP, sustaining daily adherence, evaluating the risk of selecting for resistance, ensuring long-term safety, and understanding changes in sexual behavior that might offset the benefits of PrEP. Alternatives to a daily oral PrEP regimen are being explored.

### Differential regulation of peripheral leukocyte genes in patients with active Crohn's disease and Crohn's disease in remission [^111awLgM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

- **Goals**: Assessment of disease severity is a frequent challenge in the management of Crohn's disease. Noninvasive, accurate markers for monitoring disease activity are urgently required. Specific gene expression patterns and molecular biomarkers associated with active Crohn's disease could serve as such markers, thereby providing a novel approach to disease activity monitoring.

- **Background**: Gene expression profiling in circulating leukocytes has shown promise in several medical conditions. Blood may provide an easily accessible surrogate tissue for using gene expression profiling to assess the activity of Crohn's disease.

- **Study**: In this study, we compared genome-wide transcription profiles of circulating leukocytes in patients with active and quiescent Crohn's disease.

- **Results**: We observed complex changes in blood gene expression patterns in active Crohn's disease; genes of various functional categories were differentially regulated between active and inactive Crohn's disease. We specifically identified a number of inflammatory molecules overexpressed or underexpressed in active Crohn's disease and validated a subset of these genes by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

- **Conclusions**: The genes differentially regulated in peripheral leukocytes represent potential new biomarkers for assessing the activity of Crohn's disease.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficient patients develop life-threatening haematotoxicity, such as pancytopenia, when treated with a standard dose of azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) due to excessive accumulation of cytotoxic metabolites. At present, it is generally recommended that these patients should not receive AZA or 6-MP treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. We report for the first time that Crohn's disease patients with TPMT deficiency can be successfully treated with AZA. We illustrate this with three cases where treatment has been successful, and toxicity has been avoided by carefully titrating the drug dose. Thus, very low TPMT activity demands pharmacogenetically guided dosing.

### Alvimopan [^113tAULK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Patients with Crohn's disease: There was no relationship between disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (measured as Crohn's Disease Activity Index or bowel movement frequency) and alvimopan pharmacokinetics (AUC or Cmax). Patients with active or quiescent Crohn's disease had increased variability in alvimopan pharmacokinetics, and exposure tended to be two-fold higher in patients with quiescent disease than in those with active disease or in normal subjects. Concentrations of the metabolite were lower in patients with Crohn's disease.

- **Drug interaction studies**:

	- **Potential for drugs to affect alvimopan pharmacokinetics**: Concomitant administration of alvimopan with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan because alvimopan is metabolized mainly by a non-CYP enzyme pathway. No clinical studies have been performed to assess the effect of concomitant administration of inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes on alvimopan pharmacokinetics.

	- **In vitro studies**: These studies suggest that alvimopan and its metabolite are substrates for p-glycoprotein. A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal any evidence that alvimopan or the metabolite pharmacokinetics were influenced by concomitant medications that are mild-to-moderate p-glycoprotein inhibitors. No clinical studies of concomitant administration of alvimopan and strong inhibitors of p-glycoprotein (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, amiodarone, itraconazole, quinine, spironolactone, quinidine, diltiazem, bepridil) have been conducted.

### Dolutegravir plus lamivudine versus dolutegravir plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in antiretroviral-naive adults with HIV-1 infection (GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2): week 48 results from two multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials [^116kGBER]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Effective two-drug regimens could decrease long-term drug exposure and toxicity for HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy (ART). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-drug regimen compared with a three-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in ART-naive adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted two identically designed, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trials: GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2. Both studies were conducted at 192 centres across 21 countries. We included participants (≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 infection and a screening HIV-1 RNA of 500,000 copies per mL or less, who were naive to ART. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a once-daily two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus lamivudine (300 mg) or a once-daily three-drug regimen of dolutegravir (50 mg) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and emtricitabine (200 mg). Both drug regimens were administered orally. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment: dolutegravir was administered as single-entity tablets (similar to its commercial formulation, except with a different film colour), while lamivudine tablets and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine tablets were over-encapsulated to visually match each other.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48 in the intention-to-treat-exposed population, evaluated using the Snapshot algorithm with a non-inferiority margin of -10%. Safety analyses were conducted on the safety population. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2 are registered with…

### Entyvio [^113Gtp91]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of intravenous Entyvio were evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (CD Trials I, II, and III) in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450).

Enrolled patients in the U.S. had, over the previous five-year period, an inadequate response or intolerance to immunomodulator therapy (i.e. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) and/or an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. Outside the US, prior treatment with corticosteroids was sufficient for entry if, over the previous five-year period, the patients were corticosteroid dependent (i.e. unable to successfully taper corticosteroids without a return of symptoms of CD) or had an inadequate response or intolerance to corticosteroids.

Patients who had received natalizumab ever in the past, and patients who had received a TNF blocker in the past 30 to 60 days were excluded from enrollment. Concomitant use of natalizumab or a TNF blocker was not allowed.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring for current and investigational inflammatory bowel disease treatments [^111M2VsW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that is antiproliferative and immunosuppressive; it impairs DNA synthesis via inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Methotrexate is mainly used to treat Crohn's disease; however, its use in patients with ulcerative colitis is controversial. A recent study of 179 patients with active ulcerative colitis found that 91 patients (51%) achieved steroid-free response with methotrexate induction therapy. However, in the 84 patients who received maintenance therapy, methotrexate was not superior to placebo in the prevention of relapse. Adverse events in patients receiving methotrexate treatment include myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, both of which are dose-dependent.

Despite this, there is a lack of data available evaluating methotrexate therapy in IBD, and there are no societal recommendations for monitoring hepatotoxicity. The authors recommend complete blood count and liver function tests before, and one month after, the initiation of methotrexate. If liver function test results are elevated, they recommend reducing the methotrexate dose. In patients with normal test results remaining on methotrexate, it is recommended to repeat these tests every 2 to 4 months. Simultaneous treatment with folic acid can reduce the adverse events associated with methotrexate treatment and is advisable. Several polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of folic acid are associated with the toxicity of methotrexate.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in Crohn's disease [^113nsGeV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition. Many patients fail to achieve remission with medical management and require surgical interventions. Purine analogues have been used to maintain surgically-induced remission in CD; however, the effectiveness of these agents remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: The objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of purine analogues for maintenance of surgically-induced remission in CD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases from inception to 30 April 2014: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register. We also searched the reference lists of all included studies and contacted personal sources and drug companies to identify additional studies. The searches were not limited by language.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared purine analogues to placebo or another intervention, with treatment durations of at least six months, were considered for inclusion. Participants were patients of any age with CD in remission following surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measures were clinical and endoscopic relapse, as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Methods

- **Study design and population**: Included studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Procedures for enrollment of HIV-1-negative individuals involved informed consent and approval by institutional review boards or similar authorities before implementation. Despite diverse funding mechanisms, all participants received F/TDF donated by Gilead Sciences, Inc (Foster City, CA). Reasons for PrEP discontinuation, including HIV-1 infection, adverse events (AEs), participant preferences, missed visits, or loss to follow-up, were defined in each study.

	- In our analysis, the follow-up period was defined from the date of PrEP initiation to the earliest of study completion, HIV-1 diagnosis, study-defined discontinuation, loss to follow-up, administrative censoring, or end of follow-up at 96 weeks. HIV-1 infections diagnosed within 60 days (approximately four times the half-life of intracellular TFV-DP) of PrEP discontinuation were included. Temporary PrEP discontinuations were accounted for by recording dates for PrEP initiation, PrEP stop, and any PrEP re-initiation. The interval between each stop and re-initiation was not regarded as on-PrEP time. We collected individual-level demographic and clinical information and HIV-1 infection statuses from each study.

	- Some studies provided measurements of TFV-DP concentration in DBSs, resistance testing results for participants diagnosed with HIV-1, data on the occurrence of renal AEs or bone fractures, and creatinine clearance. All available data were included in the analysis. We defined the HIV-1 incidence rate (IR) as the number…

### Challenges and opportunities for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in the prevention of HIV infection: Where are we in Europe [^11446vbr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Following the US Food and Drug Administration's approval in July 2012 of daily oral tenofovir and emtricitabine for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection in high-risk individuals in the United States, there has been much controversy about the implementation of this PrEP regimen in other countries throughout the world, particularly in Europe. This review focuses on the challenges and opportunities of a daily oral PrEP regimen to curb the rising incidence of HIV infection in high-risk groups, particularly in men who have sex with men.

A number of issues need to be addressed before PrEP could be implemented, including assessing the real effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of daily PrEP, the sustainability of daily adherence, the risk of selecting resistance, long-term safety, and the risk of change in sexual behavior that might offset the benefit of PrEP. Alternatives to a daily oral PrEP regimen are being explored.

### Odefsey [^111MChRp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Emtricitabine (FTC) is a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate. This compound inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. Emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, Ɛ, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

Rilpivirine (RPV) is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1. It inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 RT and does not inhibit human cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir, a 2'-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analog. Plasma exposure to TAF allows for its permeation into cells, where it is converted intracellularly to tenofovir through hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Tenofovir is then phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. This metabolite inhibits HIV-1 replication by being incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination.

Tenofovir has activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Cell culture studies have shown that both tenofovir and FTC can be fully phosphorylated when combined in cells. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase.

### Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide vs emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (DISCOVER): primary results from a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^115z5BQG]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Tenofovir alafenamide shows high antiviral efficacy and improved renal and bone safety compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when used for HIV treatment. Here, we report primary results from a blinded phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide versus emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV prevention.

- **Methods**: This study is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial conducted at 94 community, public health, and hospital-associated clinics located in regions of Europe and North America. These regions have a high incidence of HIV or a high prevalence of people living with HIV, or both.

We enrolled adult cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men, both groups being at high risk of acquiring HIV based on their self-reported sexual behavior in the past 12 weeks or their recent history (within 24 weeks of enrollment) of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Participants with prior use of PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were not excluded. We used a computer-generated random allocation sequence to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive either emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide group), or emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) tablets daily, with matched placebo tablets.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis and the promise of combination prevention approaches [^115viubg]. AIDS and Behavior (2011). Low credibility.

"Can a pill a day prevent HIV?" is the tagline of recruitment advertisements for an HIV prevention trial aiming to test whether a combination pill, namely tenofovir/emtricitabine or Truvada®, can reduce the number of HIV infections when taken daily by men who have sex with men (MSM). This approach, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is being evaluated in various studies across different populations worldwide, using either a daily tenofovir or Truvada® pill. Early data from PrEP trials were presented at the International AIDS Society conference in Vienna in July 2010; additional results are anticipated to be presented and/or published before this article appears in print. Tenofovir gel is also being evaluated as "topical PrEP" (also known as microbicides), both vaginally and rectally, and is more fully described in the article by McGowan in this issue of AIDS and Behavior.

In this article, we review the rationale for using orally-administered antiretrovirals for prevention in HIV-negative persons, both as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We outline the issues that the first generation of trials are designed to address as well as the questions that must be tackled by future studies. Because pills alone will never completely control the AIDS epidemic, we also discuss the rationale for combination prevention approaches that may integrate PrEP (if proven efficacious) with other prevention strategies.

### Determination of thiopurine methyltransferase genotype or phenotype optimizes initial dosing of azathioprine for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^113GJTSh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Although azathioprine (AZA) is an effective immunomodulator in treating Crohn's disease, some patients develop leukopenia and risk severe infections. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of AZA, and its activity is inversely related to the risk of developing acute leukopenia.

- **Goals**: The aim of this retrospective study is to determine whether initial AZA dosing, based on TPMT genotype or phenotype, alters the likelihood of developing acute leukopenia.

- **Study**: Between January 2000 and February 2001, 71 patients with Crohn's disease considered for AZA therapy and with a recorded TPMT genotype or phenotype were identified using a comprehensive text-oriented database at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Presbyterian Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA. The baseline demographics, TPMT genotype or phenotype, initial dose of oral AZA, subsequent white blood counts, and complications that necessitated discontinuation of therapy were evaluated.

- **Results**: Of the 63 patients with normal TPMT activity, 45 were started on 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/d of AZA, seven received doses less than 2 mg/kg/d, and 11 did not start AZA. Of the eight patients with intermediate TPMT activity, seven were started on 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/d of AZA, and one did not receive treatment. None of the patients that received AZA developed acute leukopenia (< 3,000/mm).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with Crohn's disease and normal TPMT activity who were started on high-dose AZA (2–2.5 mg/kg/d) and patients with intermediate enzyme activity who were started on reduced doses of AZA did not develop acute leukopenia.

### Descovy [^116MZLtZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of antiviral treatments was thoroughly examined through cell culture studies.

- **Antiviral activity in cell culture**: Emtricitabine (FTC) demonstrated notable antiviral activity against both laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1. This activity was assessed in various cell types, including T lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The EC50 values for FTC ranged from 1.3 to 640 nM. In terms of cell culture efficacy against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, the EC50 values were between 7–75 nM. Additionally, FTC exhibited strain-specific activity against HIV-2, with EC50 values spanning 7 to 1,500 nM.

	- In further studies involving FTC combined with a broad panel of representative classes of approved anti-HIV agents, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), no antagonistic effects were detected.

- **Tenofovir alafenamide**: The antiviral potential of Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B was evaluated across different cell types such as lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), primary monocyte/macrophage cells, and CD4+-T lymphocytes. The EC50 values for TAF were reported to be between 2.0 and 14.7 nM. In cell culture experiments, TAF showed antiviral activity against all HIV-1 groups (M, N, O), and sub-types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with EC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 12.0 nM. Its activity against HIV-2 strains was similarly strain-specific, with EC50 values from 0.91 to 2.63 nM.

	- Studies of TAF in combination with a broad range of approved anti-HIV agents — encompassing NRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs — did not reveal any antagonistic interactions.

- **Prophylactic activity in a nonhuman primate model of HIV-1 transmission**: Additional research is required to further understand the prophylactic efficacy in nonhuman models.
