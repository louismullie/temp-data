## Question

Can piperacillin-tazobactam be used to treat bullous pemphigoid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether piperacillin–tazobactam can be used to treat bullous pemphigoid, and why or why not, supported by evidence and references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard-of-care treatments for bullous pemphigoid. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and labeled indications for piperacillin–tazobactam. Next, I will check whether any trials or guidelines support its use in bullous pemphigoid. After that, I need to assess potential harms or paradoxical immune effects of piperacillin–tazobactam relevant to autoimmune blistering disease. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically sound conclusion and suggest evidence-based alternatives, making sure I have not overlooked infectious complications where antibiotics are appropriate [^112YXU7X] [^1167JNV6].

> Let me first confirm the disease construct: bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease driven by autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal antigens (BP180 and BP230), producing inflammation and tense bullae, which means the therapeutic target is the dysregulated immune response rather than microbes [^116fx6WT] [^112YXU7X].

> I need to review evidence-based treatments to anchor the standard of care; oral and super-potent topical corticosteroids are foundational, doxycycline is a validated anti-inflammatory alternative in the BLISTER randomized trial, and steroid-sparing immunomodulators and IVIG are used in selected cases, with real-world data suggesting reduced in-hospital mortality after IVIG availability, so the treatment paradigm is immunosuppression or immunomodulation rather than antibacterials per se [^114SWcJV] [^112VU29U] [^112YXU7X] [^1171Z5bq] [^115YddEr] [^1165gqVd].

> Wait, let me verify why antibiotics sometimes appear in BP discussions; tetracyclines like doxycycline and minocycline confer benefit primarily via anti-inflammatory and matrix metalloproteinase–modulating effects rather than antimicrobial killing, which cannot be generalized to unrelated antibiotic classes without similar immunomodulatory properties [^112VU29U] [^112xKnte].

> Next, I should confirm what piperacillin–tazobactam is and is not; it is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination with bactericidal activity via cell wall inhibition, indicated for bacterial infections such as intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, and bacterial skin and soft tissue infection, with no indication or mechanistic rationale for autoimmune blistering diseases [^1167JNV6] [^113XTchg] [^116gYFKN] [^115fD5qK] [^113T32Gc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm there is truly a mechanism mismatch, and indeed piperacillin–tazobactam lacks known immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory actions relevant to BP pathogenesis, so using it to treat an autoimmune process would be conceptually off-target unless there is a concomitant bacterial infection needing coverage [^1167JNV6] [^115fD5qK].

> I will now examine whether any trials or guidelines support piperacillin–tazobactam in BP; comprehensive reviews and guidelines list steroids, tetracyclines, and immunomodulatory agents, but there are no randomized trials, guideline endorsements, or credible case series supporting piperacillin–tazobactam as a BP therapy, which strengthens the conclusion that it has no therapeutic role for BP itself [^112YXU7X] [^1165gqVd] [^116fx6WT].

> But wait, what if piperacillin–tazobactam could be harmful in this context; there are reports of piperacillin–tazobactam triggering linear IgA bullous dermatosis and severe immune-mediated hematologic toxicity, alongside postmarketing signals for severe cutaneous adverse reactions like SJS/TEN, so beyond lacking benefit in BP, it may precipitate autoimmune blistering or immunologic complications in vulnerable patients [^117NbkFB] [^116Rj9Ni] [^117H7kMb] [^1131GXcs] [^113H7wQz].

> I should double-check whether antibiotics in general can trigger BP; indeed, penicillins are among drugs implicated in drug-induced BP, underscoring that beta-lactams are not benign in this disease space and should be reserved for bona fide infections rather than used as disease-directed therapy for BP [^112LUDeJ].

> Let me reconsider the practical nuance; if a patient with BP has secondarily infected erosions or cellulitis, culture-directed antibiotics may be indicated for the infection, but that is separate from treating the autoimmune disease, and even then, standard SSTI guidance applies (for example, topical agents for impetigo or appropriate systemic therapy when needed), not piperacillin–tazobactam by default unless clinical severity and likely pathogens justify it [^113icsrx] [^116gYFKN].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise and reference-supported: piperacillin–tazobactam should not be used to treat bullous pemphigoid because BP is autoimmune and requires immunomodulation, there is no supporting evidence for beta-lactam therapy in BP, and piperacillin–tazobactam may precipitate immune-mediated adverse events; evidence-based options include super-potent topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids when needed, doxycycline as a safer initial strategy in many patients, and selected steroid-sparing agents or IVIG based on severity and comorbidity profile [^112YXU7X] [^114SWcJV] [^112VU29U] [^115YddEr] [^1165gqVd] [^1171Z5bq].

---

Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not indicated for bullous pemphigoid** because it is an antibiotic with no immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory activity [^115fD5qK]. It is **only used for confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infection** in BP patients [^113XTchg]. Standard BP treatment is with topical or systemic corticosteroids, doxycycline, or immunosuppressive agents; piperacillin-tazobactam **should not be used as primary or adjunctive therapy** for BP itself [^112YXU7X] [^114SWcJV] [^111MPo6Q] [^116fx6WT].

---

## Pharmacological properties of piperacillin-tazobactam

Piperacillin-tazobactam is a **combination of a broad-spectrum penicillin and a β-lactamase inhibitor** used for severe polymicrobial infections, including skin and soft tissue infections, intra-abdominal infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113XTchg]. It has **no immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects** relevant to BP management [^1167JNV6].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding piperacillin-tazobactam in bullous pemphigoid

There is **no evidence** supporting piperacillin-tazobactam for BP: it is not mentioned in BP treatment guidelines or reviews, and no trials or case series support its use for BP [^116fx6WT] [^112YXU7X] [^111MPo6Q]. Its role is limited to treating **secondary bacterial infections** in BP patients [^113XTchg].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Piperacillin-tazobactam can cause **hypersensitivity reactions**, including rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as SJS/TEN and DRESS, which can mimic or worsen BP [^113H7wQz] [^117NbkFB]. It also carries risks of hematologic abnormalities, renal impairment, and gastrointestinal effects that may complicate BP management [^116222rw] [^113H7wQz].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard BP treatments include topical or systemic corticosteroids, doxycycline, and immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and rituximab [^112YXU7X] [^114SWcJV] [^111MPo6Q]. These therapies have demonstrated efficacy in controlling BP, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam has **no evidence of efficacy** in BP management [^115YddEr] [^116fx6WT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend piperacillin-tazobactam for BP**; it is **used only when there is a confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infection** [^112YXU7X] [^113XTchg]. Its use should be guided by **culture results and antibiotic susceptibility testing** [^113T32Gc].

---

## Clinical scenarios for piperacillin-tazobactam use in BP patients

Piperacillin-tazobactam may be appropriate for BP patients with **confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infections**, such as cellulitis, wound infections, or sepsis — especially when polymicrobial infection or resistant organisms are suspected [^116gYFKN]. Its use should be guided by **culture results and antibiotic susceptibility testing**.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not indicated for BP management** [^112YXU7X]; it should be used only for **confirmed or strongly suspected secondary bacterial infections** in BP patients. Standard BP treatments include corticosteroids, doxycycline, and immunosuppressive agents [^114SWcJV]. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with piperacillin-tazobactam, including hypersensitivity reactions and SCARs, and use it cautiously in BP patients [^113H7wQz].

### Bullous pemphigoid: A practical approach to diagnosis and management in the modern era [^116fx6WT]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder, primarily presenting with tense bullae and severe pruritus. Diagnosing and treating BP can be challenging due to its variable clinical presentations. We will briefly discuss these phenotypes, highlight diagnostic basics, and summarize recent laboratory advancements that have improved diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy.

The treatment landscape for BP has evolved significantly. Newer therapies, including biologics such as rituximab, omalizumab, dupilumab, and Janus kinase inhibitors, target the immunopathogenesis of BP and can reduce the adverse effects associated with cumulative corticosteroid exposure and conventional immunosuppressants.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of BP's clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and emerging therapeutic options, emphasizing personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: A pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^114SWcJV]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

We included two primary outcomes to measure the trade-off between effectiveness (initial blister control) and safety (serious adverse effects) for the two treatment strategies. Short-term control (effectiveness) was measured at 6 weeks after randomisation, and long-term safety was measured at 52 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcomes were the absolute difference between the treatment groups in: the proportion of participants classed as treatment success (three or fewer significant blisters) at 6 weeks, regardless of whether their treatment had been modified because of a poor response (non-inferiority effectiveness comparison of treatment strategy), and the proportion of participants with grade 3–5 (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment in the 52 weeks following randomisation (superiority safety comparison). A modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) was used.

Secondary effectiveness outcomes were the proportion of participants who were deemed treatment successes (three or fewer significant blisters and no treatment modification before 6 weeks as a more direct comparison of drug rather than treatment strategy), the proportion classed as treatment success at 13 and 52 weeks (three or fewer significant blisters and no treatment modification), and relapses (those with further episodes of bullous pemphigoid during the study who had previously been classed as a success). Secondary safety outcomes were the proportion reporting related adverse events.

### Interventions for bullous pemphigoid [^112YXU7X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disease. Oral steroids are the standard treatment. We have updated this review, which was first published in 2002, because several new treatments have since been tried.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of treatments for bullous pemphigoid.

- **Search methods**: We updated searches of the following databases to November 2021: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched five trial databases to January 2022 and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs of treatments for immunofluorescence-confirmed bullous pemphigoid.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors, working independently, evaluated the studies against the review's inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. Using GRADE methodology, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome in each comparison. Our primary outcomes were healing of skin lesions and mortality.

- **Main results**: We identified 14 RCTs (1442 participants). The main treatment modalities assessed were oral steroids, topical steroids, and the oral anti-inflammatory antibiotic doxycycline. Most studies reported mortality, but adverse events and quality of life were not well reported. We decided to look at the primary outcomes 'disease control' and 'mortality'. Almost all studies investigated different comparisons; two studies were placebo-controlled. The results are therefore based on a single study.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^116Rj9Ni]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) is a side effect of medication that can cause serious consequences. The annual incidence of DIIHA with obvious anemia is 1–4 per million people. The mechanism of DIIHA is due to the immune damage to red blood cells (RBCs) caused by drug-induced antibodies (including drug-dependent antibodies and/or drug-independent antibodies) or non-immunologic protein adsorption (NIPA). It has been reported that nearly 140 kinds of drugs can cause DIIHA through drug-induced antibodies, and 10 kinds of drugs with NIPA effect.

Piperacillin is a semi-synthetic penicillin effective against pseudomonas, belonging to the β-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotics. It exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting the synthesis of sensitive bacterial cell walls. Some pathogenic bacteria can produce β-lactamase, making them resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. Tazobactam is an irreversible competitive β-lactamase inhibitor. The combined administration of piperacillin and tazobactam can prevent pathogens producing β-lactamase from being resistant to piperacillin, thereby expanding the antibacterial spectrum of piperacillin and improving the antibacterial effect. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been widely used for bacterial infections. However, piperacillin is one of the most common drugs that cause DIIHA and can cause fatal hemolytic anemia. Tazobactam has been confirmed to have NIPA effects and can cause mild hemolysis.

Here we report a 79-year-old male patient with hypertensive nephropathy who developed severe hemolytic anemia during intravenous administration of piperacillin-tazobactam.

### Minocycline as a therapeutic option in bullous pemphigoid [^112xKnte]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

We present a retrospective analysis of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) treated with minocycline in the Department of Dermatology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, between July 1986 and May 2000. More than 200 patients with BP were seen in the clinic during the review period. Of these, 22 patients were treated with minocycline, mostly as adjuvant therapy. The response to treatment was assessed by clinical improvement and whether the dose of immunosuppressive drugs was subsequently reduced.

A major response was observed in six patients, a minor response in 11, and no response was seen in five patients. Minocycline was discontinued in four patients due to the occurrence of side effects. Overall analysis revealed marked clinical benefits of minocycline in BP. However, this is a non-placebo-controlled study and should now be followed by a prospective double-blind controlled clinical trial.

### Tetracycline and niacinamide control bullous pemphigoid but not pemphigus foliaceus when these conditions coexist [^112N27g7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pemphigus and pemphigoid represent distinct types of autoimmune bullous diseases and can co-occur in the same patient. We present a case involving a female patient with such a condition. Initially, we diagnosed her with bullous pemphigoid and administered treatment with tetracycline, niacinamide, and a topical steroid. While the tense bullas disappeared soon after, crusted erythemas, particularly on her head and trunk, persisted. Further examination with BP180 and desmoglein 1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and histological features revealed the concurrent presence of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus foliaceus. Consequently, we administered prednisolone, which successfully controlled both conditions. This case demonstrates that tetracycline and niacinamide are effective in managing bullous pemphigoid but not pemphigus foliaceus, whereas prednisolone can effectively control both conditions.

### Definitions and outcome measures for bullous pemphigoid: Recommendations by an international panel of experts [^11547aDc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Our scientific knowledge of bullous pemphigoid (BP) has dramatically progressed in recent years. Despite the availability of various therapeutic options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, only a few multicenter controlled trials have defined effective therapies in BP. A major obstacle in sharing multicenter-based evidence for therapeutic efforts is the lack of generally accepted definitions for the clinical evaluation of patients with BP.

Common terms and endpoints of BP are needed so experts in the field can accurately measure and assess disease extent, activity, severity, and therapeutic response, facilitating and advancing clinical trials. These recommendations from the International Pemphigoid Committee represent two years of collaborative efforts to attain mutually acceptable common definitions for BP and propose a disease extent score, the BP Disease Area Index. These items should assist in the development of consistent reporting of outcomes in future BP reports and studies.

### Treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced bullous pemphigoid with methotrexate [^117JfPiW]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disorder typically characterized by pruritic tense bullae caused by autoantibodies targeting the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being increasingly utilized in the treatment of many malignancies; however, cutaneous immune-related adverse effects (cirAEs) are common. ICI-induced BP (ICI-BP) is a cirAE that affects 1.0% of ICI-treated patients. When left untreated, ICI-BP may lead to significant morbidity. In addition, immunosuppressive systemic therapies used to treat ICI-BP and/or ICI interruption required to adequately control ICI-BP may result in a worsening of the cancer prognosis. As a result, ICI-BP represents a particularly challenging cirAE in both oncological and dermatologic care, and the identification of therapeutic agents that manage the skin toxicity with minimal immunosuppression is of particular interest.

As a steroid-sparing, cost-effective, and widely available immunomodulator, methotrexate has demonstrated efficacy for ICI-induced psoriasis, BP unrelated to ICIs, and rheumatologic irAEs. Yet, methotrexate use in ICI-BP remains infrequently described. This retrospective review of 4 methotrexate-treated ICI-BP patients showed that all patients achieved BP resolution, discontinuing steroids on average 4.0 months after starting methotrexate. Methotrexate was well-tolerated; only 1 patient (25%) experienced mild side effects (fatigue, gastrointestinal upset). These cases and a review of similarly published cases highlight methotrexate as a safe, effective treatment option for ICI-BP.

### Efficacy of dapsone in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid: Analysis of current data [^111MPo6Q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Dapsone is a chemotherapeutic agent primarily used in treating leprosy, Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously carinii) pneumonia, and malaria. It is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid. To assess the role of dapsone in the treatment of pemphigus and pemphigoid, a retrospective review of reports in the English-language literature was conducted.

Information on the number of patients treated, their average age, prior therapies, indications for use, protocol (dose and interval) used, concomitant therapies, reported adverse effects, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. There were 35 case reports/series published, describing the use of dapsone in a total of 427 patients. Data on 55 pemphigus patients were obtained from several case reports, some case series, and one randomized controlled trial. Of these, 32 patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 14 patients with pemphigus foliaceus responded to dapsone.

Data from 13 case series, each including at least five patients, accounted for 372 patients with pemphigoid. The overall response rates to dapsone, when given either alone or in combination with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, were 84% in mucous membrane pemphigoid and 81% in bullous pemphigoid. Hemolysis was the most common adverse effect observed. Dapsone is a promising and useful agent in patients with autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases, especially in mucous membrane pemphigoid. It can be used as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. Therefore, its combined use with oral corticosteroids may be useful in pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid.

### Zosyn [^115m1SU6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In pediatrics, piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in younger patients compared to older children and adults. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, estimated clearance for patients aged 9 months to 12 years was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients aged 2 to 9 months. In patients younger than 2 months of age, the clearance of piperacillin is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age.

In geriatrics, the impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects, aged 18 to 35 years (n = 6) and aged 65 to 80 years (n = 12). The mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to the younger subjects. This difference may be due to age-related changes in creatinine clearance.

Regarding race, the effect on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. No difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics was observed between Asian (n = 9) and Caucasian (n = 9) healthy volunteers who received single 4/0.5 g doses.

In terms of drug interactions, the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between Zosyn and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, and vecuronium has been assessed.

### Immuno-oncology: Dupilumab for bullous pemphigoid related to immune checkpoint inhibitors: a retrospective case series [^112o3JSJ]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Patient cohort**: Patients seen at our institution from April 1, 2020, to April 1, 2024, with ICD-10 codes L12, T14, L10, and R23.8; keywords of "bullous", "pemphigoid", and "BP" in their dermatology clinic notes; or have bullous pemphigoid lab results (testing for bullous pemphigoid antigen II or bullous pemphigoid antigen I) were identified using a database query (n = 7946). These patients were further queried via review of medication lists to provide a list of patients who had received dupilumab (n = 152). A manual chart review was then conducted to identify patients who received dupilumab for treatment of bullous pemphigoid, which was believed to be caused or exacerbated by ICI therapy per dermatology notes, yielding a final cohort of 17 patients.

- **Clinical characteristics and outcomes**: Patients' charts were reviewed for clinical data including dates of ICI treatment, irBP symptoms, systemic treatments received for irBP, response to BP treatment, and dates of last follow-up, death, first progression of the primary malignancy, and adverse events. Additionally, patients' charts were reviewed for demographic information, laboratory results relevant to bullous pemphigoid, and the mechanism of dupilumab (BP180, BP230, IL5, IL6, and IgE), and pathological analyses for sites of irBP that were biopsied. ICI-related bullous pemphigoid diagnoses were confirmed via review of clinical notes, serum testing for bullous pemphigoid-associated antibodies (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence), and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) findings.

### Assessing the effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on hematological parameters in patients admitted with moderate or severe foot infections [^112Tsg9S]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

In 2015, the worldwide prevalence of diabetes in adults aged between 20 and 79 years old was estimated at 415 million people, with an annual global cost of approximately US$1.3 trillion. A significant part of this cost was due to acute hospital admissions. Diabetic foot infections are common and represent the most frequent cause of a "diabetes-specific" acute hospital admission, accounting for the most hospital days of all diabetes-related complications.

Most moderate to severe diabetic foot infections result from polymicrobial colonization by Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. The empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to obtaining sensitivities has been clinically effective, with reported rates of clinical resolution between 77% and 94%. Piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin®, Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, UK) is an antibiotic comprising the extended-spectrum agent piperacillin and the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. It is active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to its extended spectrum, this drug has been effective in treating moderate to severe diabetic foot infections, showing an advantage over ertapenem. Consequently, piperacillin/tazobactam is often recommended as first-line empirical treatment due to its high efficacy and relative safety compared to other antibiotics.

The manufacturer's package leaflet for piperacillin/tazobactam has documented that pancytopenia is a side effect.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis presenting clinically as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap [^117NbkFB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone, visualized by direct immunofluorescence. Patients with LABD typically present with widespread vesicles and bullae. However, the clinical presentation of this disease is heterogeneous, and LABD clinically presenting as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an infrequent yet well-described phenomenon. Most cases of LABD are idiopathic, but some are drug-induced, with multiple drugs implicated in its development. We report a case of piperacillin-tazobactam-induced LABD presenting clinically as SJS/TEN overlap. This is the first reported case of a strong causal association between piperacillin-tazobactam and the development of LABD.

### SPL drug information for piperacillin sodium / tazobactam sodium [^112SCeEe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of piperacillin/tazobactam IV (also known as Zosyn) in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20–40 mL/min:

- **Maximal dose**: Administer a maximum dose of 2.25 g. Do not exceed a frequency of every 6 hours (q6h).
- **Monitor for neuromuscular excitability and convulsions**.
- **For nosocomial pneumonia only**: Reduce the dose to 3.375 g every 6 hours.

### Zosyn [^111mFPvN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Renal impairment**: After the administration of single doses of piperacillin and tazobactam to subjects with renal impairment, the half-life of piperacillin and tazobactam increases with decreasing creatinine clearance. At creatinine clearance below 20 mL/min, the increase in half-life is twofold for piperacillin and fourfold for tazobactam compared to subjects with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments for Zosyn are recommended when creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min in patients receiving the usual recommended daily dose of Zosyn [see Dosage and Administration (2) for specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with renal impairment].

	- Hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of a piperacillin and tazobactam dose with an additional 5% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. Peritoneal dialysis removes approximately 6% and 21% of the piperacillin and tazobactam doses, respectively, with up to 16% of the tazobactam dose removed as the tazobactam metabolite. For dosage recommendations for patients undergoing hemodialysis, see Dosage and Administration (2).

	- **Hepatic impairment**: The half-life of piperacillin and tazobactam increases by approximately 25% and 18%, respectively, in patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy subjects. However, this difference does not warrant dosage adjustment of Zosyn due to hepatic cirrhosis.

### The association of bullous pemphigoid with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors: A ten-year prospective observational study [^113YNYJA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is the most common chronic autoimmune bullous skin disease. Recent studies have suggested dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors as possible predisposing agents of bullous pemphigoid. The objective of our study was to prospectively estimate the association between gliptins and the development of bullous pemphigoid.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study that included all patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven bullous pemphigoid in the Dermatology Department of our hospital between April 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019. The diagnosis was based on specific clinical, histological, and immunological features.

- **Results**: Overall, 113 consecutive patients (age 75 ± 13 years, 62 females) with the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid were enrolled. Seventy-six patients (67.3%) had type 2 diabetes, and 52 (46%) were treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors. The most frequently prescribed gliptin was vildagliptin, administered to 45 cases (39.8% of total patients enrolled, 86.5% of the patients treated with gliptins). Gliptins were withdrawn immediately after the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, which, together with steroid administration, led to remission of the rash.

- **Conclusions**: This study revealed that treatment with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors, especially vildagliptin, is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing bullous pemphigoid.

### Comparison of four antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods to determine the in vitro activities of piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam against clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^112sYLYT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Susceptibility to piperacillin was similar to that of piperacillin-tazobactam (less than 1% difference) for 6,938 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes and 13,954 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae tested using a Vitek system; in contrast, susceptibility rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 5.9 to 13.9% higher than to piperacillin using disk diffusion, MicroScan, and Vitek 2 testing.

Unprecedented phenotypes, including piperacillin susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam intermediate; piperacillin intermediate and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant; and piperacillin susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant, accounted for 6.1% of the results for E. aerogenes isolates and 6.0% of the results for E. cloacae isolates tested with the Vitek system.

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid [^115YddEr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most frequent autoimmune blistering skin disease. Until recently, it was treated with oral corticosteroids. High-dose steroids are poorly tolerated in the elderly and likely contributed to the high mortality rates observed in several cohorts. For years, efforts have been devoted to finding steroid-sparing agents, including immunosuppressive drugs, plasma exchanges, intravenous immunoglobulins, and tetracycline. Many of these agents seemed useful in open series, but they proved ineffective or only marginally effective when tested in randomized controlled trials.

An important breakthrough occurred when a large randomized trial demonstrated that a "super-potent" topical corticosteroid, clobetasol propionate, was not only associated with a significant decrease in severe complications and mortality of BP patients but was also more effective than oral prednisone. New strategies for BP should include topical clobetasol propionate as the first-line treatment, with adjuvant therapy considered only in the very rare cases that are resistant or intolerant to this treatment.

### Burn injury and augmented renal clearance: A case for optimized piperacillin-tazobactam dosing [^112zR9TZ]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Patients with burn injuries are at high risk for infection as well as altered antimicrobial pharmacokinetics. Those with a total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury ≥ 20% are cited as at risk for augmented renal clearance (ARC). Our case report describes an obese patient with 3.2% TBSA partial thickness burns who suffered from burn wound cellulitis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Measured CLcr documented the presence of ARC, and a 22.5 grams daily continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated. Therapeutic monitoring of piperacillin at steady state was 78 mcg/mL, achieving the prespecified goal piperacillin concentration of 100% 4-times the minimum inhibitory concentration, assuming MIC for susceptible P. aeruginosa at 16/4 mcg/mL per Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute.

Available literature suggests that younger critically ill patients with lower organ failure scores and a higher percentage of TBSA are most likely to exhibit ARC, which does not entirely align with the characteristics of our patient. In addition, piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with altered pharmacokinetics in ARC, burn, and obese populations, demonstrating failure to meet target attainment with standard doses. We suggest a continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam be used when ARC is identified. This case report describes the unique findings of ARC in a non-critically ill burn patient and rationalizes the need for further prospective research to classify incidence, risk factors, and appropriate antimicrobial regimens.

Pemphigoid nodularis is a chronic and uncommon variant of bullous pemphigoid. The condition is characterized by the presence of prurigo nodularis-like lesions, a possible history of blistering, and immunohistochemical findings of bullous pemphigoid. These patients are often unresponsive to conventional therapy with potent topical and systemic steroids, and different immunosuppressive agents used alone or in combination. We describe two cases of pemphigoid nodularis treated successfully with sulfamethoxypyridazine without any adverse effects.

### A national retrospective cohort study comparing the effects of cefepime versus piperacillin-tazobactam on the development of severe acute kidney injury in patients with septic shock [^115FXj2u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating patients with potential gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, its effects have not been compared with cefepime in patients with septic shock. This study compared the effects of cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam on the incidence of severe AKI in these patients.

This retrospective, multicenter, inverse probability-of-treatment weighted cohort study was conducted in 220 geographically diverse community and teaching hospitals across the United States. Adult patients were included if they had septic shock upon hospital admission and received either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam. The proportions of patients in whom stage 3 AKI occurred during hospitalization were compared between groups.

Of the 8,427 patients in the final cohort, 4,569 received cefepime and 3,858 received piperacillin-tazobactam. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 66.2 (15.2) years, with 45.3% being female. The mean (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 48 (24) mL/min/1.73 m² on the day of admission. In the weighted cohort, stage 3 AKI occurred in 9.9% of those receiving cefepime and 9.8% of those receiving piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, .84–1.15]; p = 0.82). Regarding secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam in terms of renal replacement therapy, in-hospital death, or major adverse kidney events.

### Zosyn [^1167JNV6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity for penicillin-binding proteins. However, it is a beta-lactamase inhibitor of molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

ZOSYN has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

- **Antimicrobial activity**: The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of ZOSYN in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

†These are not beta-lactamase producing bacteria and, therefore, are susceptible to piperacillin alone.

### Bullous pemphigoid secondary to pembrolizumab mimicking toxic epidermal necrolysis [^111hnpst]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Similar to other cases of BP secondary to pembrolizumab, our patient was successfully treated with systemic steroids. Because of the unpredictable timeline of the development of BP secondary to pembrolizumab, it is important to monitor for cutaneous symptoms while a patient is receiving the drug. It is also important to understand the course of clinical presentation of pembrolizumab-induced BP and that widespread bullae development can lead to confluent denuded patches, mimicking TEN. Although much remains to be discovered about the adverse effects of anti–PD-1 drugs, the number of reported cases of these medications precipitating SJS/TEN in patients is similar in number to reports of BP. Because of stark differences in the prognosis of BP and SJS/TEN, early differentiation of BP from SJS/TEN could lead to a drastic improvement in patient outcome. In the context of pembrolizumab-induced BP, the most helpful distinguishing features are serology/histopathology, the presence of pruritus, the absence of fever, and chronicity, especially in relation to pembrolizumab treatment initiation.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: Clinical implications of an extended-infusion dosing strategy [^117GV2zs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is frequently used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in critically ill patients. To improve clinical outcomes, an extended-infusion dosing scheme for piperacillin-tazobactam therapy was devised using a Monte Carlo simulation and adopted into clinical practice at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York. This study evaluates the clinical implications of extended infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for critically ill patients with P. aeruginosa infection.

- **Methods**: We performed a cohort study of patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for a P. aeruginosa infection that was susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam during the period January 2000 to June 2004. Prior to February 2002, all patients received intermittent infusions of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g intravenously for 30 minutes every 4 or 6 hours). After this time, all patients received extended infusions of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g intravenously for 4 hours every 8 hours). Data on demographic characteristics, disease severity, and microbiology were collected, and outcomes were compared between groups.

- **Results**: A total of 194 patients comprised the two study groups: 102 patients received extended infusions of piperacillin-tazobactam, and 92 patients received intermittent infusions of piperacillin-tazobactam. No differences in baseline clinical characteristics were noted between the two groups. Among patients with Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation-II scores ≥ 17, the 14-day mortality rate was significantly lower among patients who received extended infusions.

### Two cases with bullous pemphigoid relapsed after using interleukin-17A inhibitors for psoriasis: A paradoxical reaction [^116yVqR7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Biological drugs, including IL-17A inhibitors, have become the first-line treatment options for moderate to severe psoriasis, and reports show a beneficial effect of IL-17A inhibitors on bullous pemphigoid. Here, we report two cases of bullous pemphigoid in remission that experienced severe flares during treatment with two major IL-17A inhibitors, namely ixekizumab or secukinumab, for their psoriasis vulgaris. The patient with bullous pemphigoid induced by secukinumab became very recalcitrant to control the relapse. This is by far the first and paradoxical report on the IL-17A inhibitors having a negative effect on bullous pemphigoid patients in previously stable status. Our reports of these two cases alert clinicians to be careful when using IL-17A inhibitors in pemphigoid patients. We also suggest that patients with psoriasis vulgaris should be asked for a detailed history of pemphigoid and its BP180 autoantibodies status should be checked before using these biologicals.

### Tazicef [^116wtAH9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common reactions were local effects following IV injection, along with allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently, and no disulfiram-like reactions were reported.

- **Local effects**: These were reported in fewer than 2% of patients and included phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients).

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: These were reported in 2% of patients and included pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: These were reported in fewer than 2% of patients and included diarrhea (1 in 78 patients), nausea (1 in 156 patients), vomiting (1 in 500 patients), and abdominal pain (1 in 416 patients). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS).

### A rare association of bullous pemphigoid with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^115Rd7gt]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune mucocutaneous subepidermal blistering disease associated with various autoimmune and neurologic conditions as well as certain medications. Although it is not generally associated with overall malignancy, it may be linked to hematologic malignancies. Specifically, bullous pemphigoid has been rarely observed with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or mycosis fungoides. Three reports describe the association of bullous pemphigoid with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides, where blistering lesions characteristic of bullous pemphigoid manifested after ultraviolet phototherapy was initiated. At the time of writing, no cases of bullous pemphigoid with previously untreated mycosis fungoides with Sézary syndrome have been reported; here we describe the first such case to our knowledge.

The study ALLIUM, published by Keith S. Kaye and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA, investigates acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and complicated urinary tract infections. The trial posed the question: Is cefepime/enmetazobactam superior to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis? It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a population of 1,034 patients (568 female, 466 male).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by Gram-negative urinary pathogens.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Urine culture with Gram-positive primary pathogen; hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to trial drugs; weight > 180 kg; life expectancy < 6-week study period.
- **Interventions**: Patients were divided into two groups: 516 received cefepime/enmetazobactam (cefepime 2 g/enmetazobactam 0.5 g given by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days) and 518 received piperacillin/tazobactam (piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g given by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days).
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in overall treatment success at day 14 (79.1% vs. 58.9%; AD 21.2%, 95% CI 14.3 to 27.9).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in clinical cure at day 14 (92.5% vs. 88.9%; AD 3.5%, 95% CI -1 to 8). However, there was a significant increase in microbiological eradication at day 14 (82.9% vs. 64.9%; AD 19%, 95% CI 12.3 to 25.4).

### Bullous pemphigoid during ustekinumab therapy [^112LUDeJ]. JAAD case reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Many drugs may induce BP, including antibiotics (penicillin, fluoroquinolone, chloroquine, rifampicin), diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although an association between frequency of BP and psoriasis may exist, several cases of bullous pemphigoid were attributed to anti–TNF-α agents. To our knowledge, no case of BP has been described during ustekinumab use, but its mechanism of action, leading to down-regulation of TNF-α, makes it possibly accountable. Ustekinumab blocks the differentiation and clonal expression of Th1 and Th17 effector cells. It results in a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α agents. Although the mechanism is not yet understood, the modification of the immune response could cause the onset of BP. Other effects of inflammatory or immune skin disorders have also been reported with ustekinumab use, including cases of alopecia areata, linear IgA dermatosis, and eczema, suggesting the potential consequences of this cytokine imbalance. In our case, several factors argue in favor of an iatrogenic origin: the relatively early age of onset, acute and limited nature of the lesions, their rapid regression after stopping ustekinumab, and no recurrence after 18 months. Metformin's causation was less probable since the patient had been on this medication for many years and because no cases of BP with Metformin's use have been reported. Additionally, infliximab may have had an impact on this patient's BP, as this treatment was introduced a few months after cessation of ustekinumab to

### Management of autoimmune bullous diseases: Pharmacology and therapeutics [^1143SsN2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Bullous diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality, resulting from an autoimmune response to one or more components of the basement membrane or desmosomes. Management involves addressing the immunologic basis of the disease, treating the inflammatory process involved in lesion formation, and providing supportive care both locally and systemically.

Therapeutic agents are selected based on their pharmacologic properties and evidence of effectiveness derived from observations and studies. At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be able to understand the pharmacology of drugs used in the treatment of bullous diseases, the principles of therapy for various such diseases, and a practical approach to their management.

### Zosyn [^111VtSvV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Risk summary:

Piperacillin and tazobactam cross the placenta in humans. However, there are insufficient data with piperacillin and/or tazobactam in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. No fetal structural abnormalities were observed in rats or mice when piperacillin and tazobactam was administered intravenously during organogenesis at doses 1 to 2 times and 2 to 3 times the human dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively, based on body-surface area (mg/m²). However, fetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity was observed in developmental toxicity and peri/postnatal studies conducted in rats (intraperitoneal administration prior to mating and throughout gestation or from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21) at doses less than the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body-surface area (mg/m²) [see Data].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data:

- **Animal data**: In embryo-fetal development studies in mice and rats, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of piperacillin and tazobactam up to 3000/750 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. There was no evidence of teratogenicity up to the highest dose evaluated, which is 1 to 2 times and 2 to 3 times the human dose of piperacillin and tazobactam in mice and rats, respectively, based on body-surface area (mg/m²).

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^117H7kMb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The results of the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for anti-IgG with a Coombs card (Diagnostic Grifols, S. A.) of blood samples collected on days 2, 1, and 0 before stopping piperacillin-tazobactam administration were strongly positive (4+). After stopping the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam, the DAT for anti-IgG results gradually weakened and turned negative until 12 days after the administration was stopped. The results of the DAT for anti-C3d (Shanghai Blood Biomedical Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China) with the tube method of all blood samples were negative.

The irregular RBC antibody test using plasma was weakly positive before stopping and became negative after stopping piperacillin-tazobactam administration. The weakly positive results may be due to the presence of piperacillin in the patient's plasma and the piperacillin-dependent antibodies having agglutinated with the RBCs. The irregular RBC antibody tests using the acid eluent (acid elution reagents were produced by Guangzhou Zhanquan Biotech Co. Ltd) collected before and after the patient stopped the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam were all negative.

Following previous reports, detection of drug-dependent antibodies in the presence of a drug solution and using drug-coated RBCs was performed. In a previous study, piperacillin may be more suitable for coating RBCs under high pH and room temperature conditions.

### Bullous pemphigoid following therapy with an oral beta-blocker [^115t1v5C]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

A causal relationship is thought to exist between several medications and the development of bullous pemphigoid. Commonly implicated medications include furosemide, penicillins, and ibuprofen. The following is a case report of an elderly man who developed generalized bullous pemphigoid for the first time after beginning therapy with an oral beta-blocker. A literature search revealed only two other reports of beta-blocker associated bullous pemphigoid. As both bullous pemphigoid and beta-blockers are common in elderly patients, dermatologists may want to consider beta-blockers as potential etiological agents in the development of bullous pemphigoid.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^112VU29U]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

We have shown that starting treatment for bullous pemphigoid with doxycycline 200 mg daily produces acceptable short-term effectiveness within our predefined non-inferiority margin, and significant safety gains at 1 year compared with initiating treatment with prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg per day. Although we did not find clear evidence that differences between the two treatment strategies varied by baseline disease severity, our study suggests that the effectiveness of either strategy is modest for those with severe disease.

Although previous studies have shown good blister control and better safety for prolonged use of super-potent topical corticosteroids over the whole body compared to high-dose oral prednisolone, such a regimen might be impractical for some patients and carers. Prolonged topical corticosteroid use also causes adverse effects such as skin thinning and effects associated with systemic absorption. Most guidelines still recommend oral prednisolone (between 0.5 mg/kg per day and 1.5 mg/kg per day according to initial severity). Most guidelines mention the widespread use of tetracyclines in bullous pemphigoid but cite the lack of high-quality evidence to inform this treatment recommendation. The Cochrane review of bullous pemphigoid found only one randomised study of 18 patients treated with tetracycline and nicotinamide versus prednisolone, which had inconclusive results; none have been published since. The BLISTER study fills this gap.

### Zosyn [^115fD5qK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zosyn is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Mechanism of action**: Zosyn functions as an antibacterial agent.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin and tazobactam, crucial for predicting clinical and microbiological efficacy, is time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The mean and coefficients of variation (CV%) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of piperacillin and tazobactam after multiple intravenous doses are summarized in Table 7. Key terms include Cmax (maximum observed concentration), AUC (area under the curve), CL (clearance), CLR (renal clearance), V (volume of distribution), and T1/2 (elimination half-life).

Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after the completion of an intravenous infusion of Zosyn. Piperacillin plasma concentrations following a 30‑minute infusion of Zosyn were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^115TWkim]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The medical history of the patient: A 79-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a history of hypertension for more than 20 years, hypertensive nephropathy for 4 years, vomiting for 9 hours, and urinary incontinence for 5 hours.

The clinical characteristics of the patient were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) 72 g/L (reference values 120–160 g/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 18 U/L (reference values < 23 U/L); total bilirubin (TBIL) 7.1 μmol/L (reference values 2–21 μmol/L); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 382 U/L (reference values 135–215 U/L); blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 31.47 mmol/L (reference values 3.0–9.2 mmol/L); creatinine (Cr) 588.3 μmol/L (reference values 71–115 μmol/L); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was within physiological levels.

Through computer tomography (CT), the diagnosis included a left frontotemporal occipital subdural hematoma, left insular hemorrhage, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary infection, hypertension grade 3 high-risk group, hypertensive nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4, and pericardial effusion.

Upon admission, treatments included the infusion of leukocyte-reduced red blood cells (LRBCs) prepared from 600 mL of whole blood, blood pressure control, hemostasis, erythropoietin, and other supportive treatments. Hemodialysis was administered once every 2–3 days until the 50th day post-admission when Cr dropped to 242.6 μmol/L, allowing for the cessation of hemodialysis.

On the 8th day after admission, the first course of piperacillin-tazobactam anti-infective treatment began. Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g was administered intravenously every 12 hours for 31 consecutive days, totaling 279 g of administration.

### Development of bullous pemphigoid during nivolumab therapy [^1128AGGb]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of cancer therapeutics that promote antitumor immune responses. Currently, U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved agents target the coregulatory molecules programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and show significant activity in multiple cancer types. These medications can induce a variety of cutaneous eruptions, the full spectrum of which is not yet completely characterized. Here, we report a case of bullous pemphigoid (BP), which began shortly after initiating treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab.

### Wound penetration of cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and vancomycin during negative pressure wound therapy [^111coExF]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) employs subatmospheric pressure as a noninvasive adjunct to treat wounds, demonstrating clinical efficacy by accelerating the healing of various acute and chronic wounds. NPWT may also aid in preventing or treating wound infections, possibly by enhancing the wound penetration of antibiotics. Nevertheless, clinical data in patients undergoing antibiotic and NPWT treatment remain limited.

To evaluate the wound penetration of antibiotics in NPWT patients, we conducted a prospective, observational study involving burn and trauma patients treated with NPWT and systemic antibiotics. We assessed the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of systemic vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as the total and unbound antibiotic concentrations in wound exudate from the same patients.

Data from 32 patients with 37 wounds undergoing NPWT showed that vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam all penetrated wounds, with exudate to plasma concentration ratios exceeding 0.8. Cefazolin, however, did not penetrate wounds in NPWT patients as effectively, with an average exudate to plasma concentration ratio of 0.51.

Clinical data on the wound penetration of antibiotics in patients undergoing NPWT are limited, but these findings suggest that antibiotics vary in their capacity for wound penetration during NPWT. This information should be considered in clinical decision-making. This initial report suggests that vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam are effective in this context.

### Trends in mortality and morbidity in patients with bullous pemphigoid before and after approval of intravenous immunoglobulin in Japan: An interrupted time-series analysis [^1171Z5bq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been reported to be an effective treatment for bullous pemphigoid. However, the impact of IVIg approval on real-world outcomes remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effect of IVIg approval on patients with bullous pemphigoid using a national inpatient database.

- **Methods**: Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we identified 14,229 patients admitted to hospital for bullous pemphigoid and treated with systemic corticosteroids between July 2010 and March 2020. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to compare in-hospital mortality and morbidity between the patients admitted before and after the approval of reimbursement of IVIg for bullous pemphigoid in the Japanese universal health insurance system in November 2015.

- **Results**: In-hospital mortality was 5.5% before and 4.5% after the approval of IVIg reimbursement. After the IVIg approval, 18% of the patients were treated with IVIg. Based on the interrupted time-series analysis, in-hospital mortality significantly decreased at the time of approval [-1.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.0 to -0.3, P = 0.009] and a downward trend was observed after the approval (-0.4% annual rate, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.1, P = 0.005). In-hospital morbidity also demonstrated a downward trend after the approval.

- **Conclusions**: IVIg approval is associated with lower in-hospital mortality and morbidity in inpatients with bullous pemphigoid.

### Guidelines for the management of bullous pemphigoid [^1165gqVd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

These guidelines have been prepared for dermatologists on behalf of the British Association of Dermatologists. They present evidence-based guidance for treatment, with identification of the strength of evidence available at the time of preparation. The guidelines provide a brief overview of epidemiological aspects, diagnosis, and investigation. They reflect data available from Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, literature searches, and the experience of the authors who have been managing patients with bullous pemphigoid in special and general clinics for over 10 years. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the data obtained from the literature, as only six randomized controlled trials are available, each involving small groups of patients.

### Effect of therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization of piperacillin/tazobactam on sepsis-related organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Vgz8q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: A baseline-adjusted linear mixed model was fitted for the primary endpoint, namely, the mean total SOFA score with treatment and renal insufficiency/expected renal replacement as fixed effects and the study center as a random effect. The main effect of the intervention was tested in a confirmatory analysis at the two-sided significance level of 5% in the intention-to-treat population. Additionally, the same model was applied for the total SOFA score at day 10 (or at earlier discharge from ICU) to explore the sensitivity regarding different definitions (mean total SOFA score day 1–day 10, total SOFA score at day 10) of the endpoint. Twenty-eight days all-cause mortality was compared by means of Fisher's exact test (two-sided), and relative risk with 95% confidence interval as well as group-wise absolute and relative frequencies are provided. Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier curves are provided for this endpoint and the log rank test was performed to compare the survival curves. SOFA subscores, length of stay (ICU, hospital), intervention-free days, total daily dose of piperacillin/tazobactam, duration of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, piperacillin concentrations up to day 10, and overall duration of antibiotic therapy were compared by independent samples t-test in case of normally distributed data or the Mann–Whitney U test otherwise, and the mean ± SD (standard deviation) or median and interquartile range are reported for both groups. Q-Q plots were used to check if the data are normally distributed. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted for neurological outcomes.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^113vw2BE]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are two distinct cutaneous conditions with substantial clinical overlap. BI is a common, highly contagious cutaneous infection often affecting children, whereas PF is a relatively rare autoimmune blistering condition. Lesions arise from disruption of desmoglein-1, a desmosomal protein required for keratinocyte adhesion, by an epidermolytic toxin or IgG autoantibodies, respectively. Given their shared pathophysiology, it is not surprising that these diseases can have similar clinical presentations and have been mistaken for one another in the literature. Correct diagnosis is critical, as BI is managed with antibiotics to curb rapid spread, and the disease course of PF is meaningfully affected by early systemic immunosuppression. We discuss the diagnosis of a case of BI masquerading as PF and the means of distinguishing the two cutaneous conditions.

### Exploring different objectives in non-inferiority trials [^113qUFaz]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

The Bullous Pemphigoid Steroids and Tetracyclines (BLISTER) trial proposed using different non-inferiority margins (percentage absolute difference) depending on the observed reduction in mortality (percentage absolute difference) in the new treatment arm compared with the control arm, with a greater difference allowing a wider margin. Margin values were obtained at two values of the difference in mortality (circles, one for declaration of the new intervention as an alternative option and one for replacement). Lines between the two points were plotted to show a hypothetical frontier of proposed margins at intermediate values for the difference in mortality, illustrating how a more granular range for the non-inferiority margin could be used. Each measured value for the additional benefit could be associated with a non-inferiority margin, or with two non-inferiority margins, by agreeing on values for an alternative option and for a replacement and plotting the curve. Data from Williams et al.

A proposed value for the non-inferiority margin based on one of these two methods could then be agreed upon and used for the trial design. If the process is carefully prespecified, the margin might be re-evaluated based on other benefits seen in the trial, or the final analysis might be conducted without reference to a margin, as discussed in different objectives: analysis and reporting.

- **Choice of outcomes**: The primary outcome, chosen to measure the efficacy of the treatment, will typically be an established measure for the disease being studied.

### Tazicef [^114Advi8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials; the most common were local reactions following IV injection, and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently, and no disulfiram-like reactions were reported.

- **Local effects**: These were reported in fewer than 2% of patients, including phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients).

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Reported in 2% of patients, these included pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, these symptoms included diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment [see WARNINGS].

### Treatment of bullous pemphigoid with dupilumab: A case series of 30 patients [^116FrYJz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is often difficult to treat with the limited therapies available. Here, we describe clinical outcomes among 30 adults with bullous pemphigoid treated with dupilumab. We performed a multicenter, retrospective case series between March 2020 and August 2022. Patients received a loading dose of dupilumab 600 mg, followed by a 300 mg maintenance dose with varying administration frequency tailored to individual patient response. All patients experienced at least some improvement in blister formation and pruritus, with 23 (76.7%) of patients demonstrating either complete clearance of blistering or a marked response. Complete clearance of pruritus or marked response was noted in 25 (83.3%) of patients. Eight patients were effectively maintained solely on dupilumab. One (3.3%) patient reported an injection site reaction.

Thirty patients represent a small sample; however, to our knowledge, this is the second largest group of BP treated with dupilumab. Furthermore, we provide an understandable framework for clinicians outside of academics to follow and assess treatment responses in their BP patients treated with dupilumab. Dupilumab should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with bullous pemphigoid given its ability to induce sustained blistering and pruritus response in both typical and refractory cases while maintaining a favorable safety profile.

### Zosyn [^112eSkYj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been postmarketing reports of overdose with piperacillin and tazobactam. The majority of those events, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have also been reported with the usual recommended dosages. Patients may experience neuromuscular excitability or seizures if higher than recommended doses are given intravenously, particularly in the presence of renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Treatment should be supportive and symptomatic according to the patient's clinical presentation. Excessive serum concentrations of either piperacillin or tazobactam may be reduced by hemodialysis. Following a single 3.375 g dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, the percentage of the piperacillin and tazobactam dose removed by hemodialysis was approximately 31% and 39%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].
