## Question

What dosing sig should be used for vardenafil?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dosing sig should be used for vardenafil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled starting dose, timing, and maximum frequency. Then, I should verify titration parameters and clarify the upper dose limit. Next, I need to check special population modifications, including geriatric, hepatic, renal, and alpha-blocker considerations. After that, I should examine CYP3A4 interaction ceilings and absolute contraindications with nitrates and riociguat. Finally, I will craft a precise prescription sig and include critical counseling points and a few special-population templates, while double-checking any areas where secondary SPL sources differ from core FDA labeling.

> Let me first confirm the core, on-label dosing foundation: for most adults, the recommended starting dose is 10 mg by mouth as needed, taken approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity, with titration based on efficacy and tolerability between 5 mg and 20 mg, and with a maximum dosing frequency of once per day; sexual stimulation is required for effect [^112JFe74] [^111t19iH] [^113h5m52].

> Wait, I should double-check the timing and administration specifics because patients often mis-time PDE5 inhibitors; the label specifies about 60 minutes pre-activity, and although onset can be earlier for some, the evidence and PK point to a median Tmax near 60 minutes, so counseling should anchor to 60 minutes to set expectations; vardenafil can be taken with or without food, but high-fat meals may lower Cmax by roughly 18–50% and could delay onset, so I should advise avoiding a heavy/fatty meal if a rapid effect is desired [^112JFe74] [^114EW8aa] [^111t19iH].

> Hold on, I need to ensure the frequency limit is explicit and practical; doses must be at least 24 hours apart and not exceed 20 mg in any 24-hour period, and the sig should explicitly state "do not exceed one dose per day" to prevent inadvertent accumulation and interaction risk [^115YLVaw] [^113h5m52] [^112JFe74].

> Next, I will review special populations; I should confirm the geriatric and hepatic guidance and the alpha-blocker caveats because these often drive starting dose changes; in adults ≥ 65 years, consider starting at 5 mg; in moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), start at 5 mg and do not exceed 10 mg; I initially thought "severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated", but wait, let me verify the label wording — FDA labeling says do not use in severe hepatic impairment, which is functionally a prohibition though listed under warnings/precautions rather than the formal contraindications section [^112JFe74].

> Hmm, the renal impairment language is tricky; I first noted "start 5 mg if eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and contraindicated in dialysis", but I should verify what the FDA label actually says; the core label advises do not use in patients on dialysis and does not provide firm eGFR-based dosing beyond that, whereas SPL summaries suggest starting at 5 mg with very low eGFR and to titrate cautiously; to stay precise, I will state the label-based dialysis prohibition and, if needed, acknowledge that some SPL references propose 5 mg starts in eGFR < 10 with careful titration, recognizing this extrapolation is less authoritative than the core label [^112JFe74] [^112JFe74] [^111ejxHV] [^115VmKpQ].

> I should confirm alpha-blocker guidance and hemodynamic stability requirements; PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers are both vasodilators, so patients should be stable on their alpha-blocker before initiating vardenafil, and vardenafil should be started at the lowest recommended dose, practically 5 mg, with careful monitoring for symptomatic hypotension, especially around coadministration timing [^113aKDEo] [^111sGDSd] [^113aKDEo] [^112MVWZN].

> Now I will examine the CYP3A4 inhibitor ceilings; strong inhibitors impose stringent limits: with ritonavir or cobicistat, no more than 2.5 mg per 72 hours, and with other strong inhibitors like ketoconazole 400 mg daily, itraconazole 400 mg daily, clarithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, or atazanavir, no more than 2.5 mg per 24 hours; with moderate inhibitors such as ketoconazole 200 mg daily, itraconazole 200 mg daily, or erythromycin, the ceiling is 5 mg per 24 hours; these constraints should be reflected directly in the sig when applicable, and I should verify that the patient's med list is screened before prescribing [^113aKDEo] [^1153sz3C].

> But wait, I must not overlook absolute contraindications and cardiovascular cautions; concomitant nitrates or nitric oxide donors are contraindicated, as is use with guanylate cyclase stimulators like riociguat, and vardenafil may add to BP-lowering with antihypertensives; QT effects are small but present in thorough QT studies, so patients with known QT prolongation risk or on QT-prolonging drugs warrant extra caution and clinician judgment [^113mkTQs] [^113aKDEo] [^1127KY4F] [^111eEjmt].

> Let me consider what safety counseling must be embedded or paired with the sig; advise stopping and seeking care for sudden vision loss suggestive of NAION and sudden hearing loss, warn about priapism and seeking urgent care for erections lasting > 4 hours, and reinforce that vardenafil does not protect against STIs; these points reduce preventable harm and align with FDA Medication Guide content [^111t19iH] [^111aAoLX] [^111sGDSd] [^111QhxzM] [^116czVBj].

> I should also confirm that dose optimization is encouraged if initial response is suboptimal, consistent with guideline-based practice; the AUA recommends titrating PDE5 inhibitors to effect and educating patients to optimize use, and the EAU emphasizes that incorrect timing and inadequate instruction are major reasons for nonresponse, so clear timing, stimulation, and food-effect counseling are essential parts of the sig and pharmacist handoff [^117DtUMB] [^1163xXQg].

> Final standard prescription sig for a typical adult patient: Vardenafil 10 mg by mouth approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity, as needed; do not exceed one dose per 24 hours; may adjust to 5 mg or 20 mg based on efficacy and tolerability; sexual stimulation required; may take with or without food, but avoid high-fat meals if a faster onset is desired [^112JFe74] [^111t19iH] [^113h5m52] [^114EW8aa].

> Special population template, geriatric or moderate hepatic impairment: Vardenafil 5 mg by mouth approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity, as needed; in Child-Pugh B do not exceed 10 mg per 24 hours; do not use in severe hepatic impairment; for age ≥ 65 years, consider starting at 5 mg with careful titration [^112JFe74].

> Special population template, patient on alpha-blocker therapy: Initiate only when the patient is hemodynamically stable on the alpha-blocker; start vardenafil at 5 mg by mouth approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity, as needed; monitor for hypotension and dizziness with any dose changes [^113aKDEo] [^111sGDSd].

> Special population template, with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: If ritonavir or cobicistat are used, do not exceed vardenafil 2.5 mg in a 72-hour period; if ketoconazole 400 mg daily, itraconazole 400 mg daily, clarithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, or atazanavir are used, do not exceed 2.5 mg per 24 hours; if ketoconazole 200 mg daily, itraconazole 200 mg daily, or erythromycin are used, do not exceed 5 mg per 24 hours [^113aKDEo] [^1153sz3C].

> Special population note, renal impairment: I initially wrote "start 5 mg if eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and avoid in dialysis", but I need to be precise; the FDA label states do not use in patients on dialysis and gives no explicit non-dialysis eGFR-based dosing, while some SPL sources suggest a 5 mg starting dose with very low eGFR and cautious titration, which can be considered secondary to core labeling and should be individualized with close monitoring [^112JFe74] [^112JFe74] [^115VmKpQ].

> Essential safety language to include in counseling: avoid with nitrates or riociguat; seek immediate care for erections lasting more than 4 hours, sudden vision loss, or sudden hearing loss; remind that sexual stimulation is required, and doses must be at least 24 hours apart; patients should contact the prescriber if efficacy is inadequate or adverse effects occur so that dosing can be adjusted safely [^113mkTQs] [^111t19iH] [^111aAoLX] [^111sGDSd] [^115YLVaw].

> Clinical pearl I should emphasize to prevent "false nonresponse": the most common reasons for failure are incorrect timing relative to activity, heavy/fatty meals delaying absorption, and insufficient sexual stimulation; explicit counseling on taking the dose about 60 minutes pre-activity, avoiding high-fat meals when a rapid onset is desired, and ensuring sexual arousal markedly improves outcomes and aligns with guideline-based optimization strategies [^111t19iH] [^114EW8aa] [^117DtUMB] [^1163xXQg].

- **Concomitant medications**:

	- **Nitrates**: Concomitant use with nitrates and nitric oxide donors in any form is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

	- **Guanylate cyclase (GC) stimulators, such as riociguat**: Concomitant use is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)].

	- **CYP3A4 inhibitors**: The dosage of vardenafil may require adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, cobicistat, and clarithromycin, as well as in other patients receiving moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

		If taking strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, the dose of vardenafil should be adjusted as follows:
		- **Ritonavir**: No more than 2.5 mg in a 72-hour period.
		- Indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, ketoconazole 400 mg daily, itraconazole 400 mg daily, clarithromycin: No more than 2.5 mg in a 24-hour period.
		- **Ketoconazole 200 mg daily, itraconazole 200 mg daily, erythromycin**: No more than 5 mg in a 24-hour period.
		- **Cobicistat**: No more than 2.5 mg in a 72-hour period.

	- **Alpha-blockers**: In patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose. Concomitant treatment should be initiated only if the patient is stable on his alpha-blocker therapy. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure in patients taking a phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitor, including vardenafil.

### Vardenafil [^114EW8aa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of vardenafil are approximately dose proportional over the recommended dose range.

- **Absorption**: Mean vardenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 20 mg to healthy male volunteers are depicted in Figure 8. Vardenafil is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 15%. Maximum observed plasma concentrations following a single 20 mg dose in healthy volunteers are usually reached between 30 minutes and 2 hours (median 60 minutes) after oral dosing in the fasted state. Two food-effect studies were conducted, which showed that high-fat meals caused a reduction in Cmax by 18% to 50%.

- **Distribution**: The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for vardenafil is 208 L, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Vardenafil and its major circulating metabolite, M1, are highly bound to plasma proteins, with about 95% binding for both the parent drug and M1. This protein binding is reversible and independent of total drug concentrations. Following a single oral dose of 20 mg vardenafil in healthy volunteers, a mean of 0.00018% of the administered dose was obtained in semen 1.5 hours after dosing.

### Vardenafil [^111t19iH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Discuss with patients the appropriate use of vardenafil and its anticipated benefits. It should be explained that sexual stimulation is required for an erection to occur after taking vardenafil. Vardenafil should be taken approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. Patients should be counseled regarding the dosing of vardenafil, especially regarding the maximum daily dose. Patients should be advised to contact their healthcare provider for dose modification if they are not satisfied with the quality of their sexual performance with vardenafil or in the case of an unwanted effect.

- **Priapism**: Inform patients that there have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for vardenafil and this class of compounds. In the event that an erection persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.

- **Drug interactions**: Advise patients to contact the prescribing physician if new medications that may interact with vardenafil are prescribed by another healthcare provider.

- **Sudden loss of vision**: Inform patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, and seek medical attention in the event of sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely.

### Vardenafil [^112JFe74]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

For most patients, the recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg, taken orally as needed, approximately 60 minutes before sexual activity. The dose may be adjusted between a maximum recommended dose of 20 mg and a lower dose of 5 mg, based on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day, and sexual stimulation is necessary for the treatment to be effective.

- **Use with food**: Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets can be taken with or without food.

- **Use in specific populations**:
	- **Geriatrics**: A starting dose of 5 mg vardenafil should be considered in patients aged 65 years or older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
	- **Hepatic impairment**: For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), a starting dose of 5 mg vardenafil is recommended. The maximum dose for these patients should not exceed 10 mg. Do not use vardenafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
	- **Renal impairment**: Do not use vardenafil in patients on renal dialysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Vardenafil [^113mkTQs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with vardenafil**: Concomitant use of vardenafil and nitrates and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated. The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual nitrates (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil, and increases in heart rate when taken at 1, 4, and 8 hours after vardenafil, were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of vardenafil in healthy middle-aged subjects. These effects were not observed when vardenafil 20 mg was taken 24 hours before the nitroglycerin (NTG). Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of nitrates for patients with ischemic heart disease has not been evaluated, and concomitant use of vardenafil and nitrates is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Alpha-blockers**: Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with co-administration of vardenafil with alfuzosin, terazosin, or tamsulosin [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Antihypertensives**: Vardenafil may add to the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents. In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure.

### Vardenafil [^116czVBj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

"See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)".

- **Nitrates**: Inform patients that vardenafil is contraindicated with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. Patients should be counseled that concomitant use of vardenafil with nitrates could cause blood pressure to suddenly drop to an unsafe level, resulting in dizziness, syncope, or even heart attack or stroke.

- **Guanylate cyclase (GC) stimulators**: Inform patients that vardenafil is contraindicated in those who use guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat.

- **Cardiovascular**: Discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity for those with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Concomitant use with drugs which lower blood pressure**: Inform patients that in some cases, the concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, with alpha-blockers can significantly lower blood pressure, leading to symptomatic hypotension, such as fainting. Patients prescribed vardenafil who are taking alpha-blockers should be started on the lowest recommended starting dose of vardenafil [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients should be advised of the possible occurrence of symptoms related to postural hypotension and appropriate countermeasures. They should also be advised to contact the prescribing physician if other antihypertensive drugs or new medications that may interact with vardenafil are prescribed by another healthcare provider.

### Vardenafil [^1127KY4F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Effects on blood pressure**:
		In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1. Vardenafil may add to the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents [see Drug Interactions (7)].

	- **Effects on blood pressure and heart rate when vardenafil is combined with nitrates**:
		A study was conducted in which the blood pressure and heart rate response to 0.4 mg nitroglycerin (NTG) sublingually was evaluated in 18 healthy subjects following pretreatment with vardenafil 20 mg at various times before NTG administration. Vardenafil 20 mg caused an additional time-related reduction in blood pressure and increase in heart rate in association with NTG administration. The blood pressure effects were observed when vardenafil 20 mg was dosed 1 or 4 hours before NTG, and the heart rate effects were observed when 20 mg was dosed 1, 4, or 8 hours before NTG. Additional blood pressure and heart rate changes were not detected when vardenafil 20 mg was dosed 24 hours before NTG.

### Vardenafil [^115YLVaw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Take vardenafil hydrochloride tablets exactly as your doctor prescribes. Do not take more than one vardenafil hydrochloride tablet a day. Doses should be taken at least 24 hours apart. Some men can only take a low dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets because of medical conditions or medicines they take. Your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you.

If you are older than 65 or have liver problems, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets. If you have prostate problems or high blood pressure, for which you take medicines called alpha-blockers, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets. If you are taking certain other medicines, your doctor may prescribe a lower starting dose and limit you to one dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in a 72-hour (3 days) period.

Take one vardenafil hydrochloride tablet about 1 hour (60 minutes) before sexual activity. Some form of sexual stimulation is needed for an erection to happen with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets. Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without meals.

Do not change your dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may lower your dose or raise your dose, depending on how your body reacts to vardenafil hydrochloride tablets.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^117DtUMB]. The Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of erectile dysfunction, specifically concerning PDE5 inhibitors, the 2018 AUA guidelines recommend offering approved oral PDE5 inhibitors, unless contraindicated, as a treatment option for patients with ED. It is advised to titrate the dose of PDE5 inhibitors to achieve optimal efficacy. Patients prescribed oral PDE5 inhibitors should be provided with instructions to maximize the benefit and efficacy of the treatment.

### Microvascular complications in diabetic erectile dysfunction: Do we need other alternatives [^114qqd1B]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **PDE5 inhibitors: Lessons learned from clinical practice**: All three PDE5 inhibitors — sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil — have undergone extensive evaluation in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) secondary to conditions such as hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, nerve injury, diabetes, or post-radical pelvic surgeries. The response rate for ED patients with these conditions is impressive, reaching as high as 60–70%. However, diabetic men have displayed impaired response rates in all therapeutic trials. The major predictors for treatment success are few diabetic complications and good glycemic control. Patients with ED secondary to radical prostatectomy present another challenging group to treat and are of significant interest to urologists.

- **Differences in pharmacokinetic profiles**: Several recent publications have emphasized that the onset time of response after oral administration of sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil may be as short as 15 minutes. However, these data can lead to mistreatment since the onset of response for most patients usually occurs when the maximum plasma concentration is reached — approximately 1 hour for sildenafil and vardenafil, and approximately 2 hours for tadalafil. Furthermore, patients taking PDE5 inhibitors should be advised to avoid fatty meals during oral administration, especially with sildenafil and vardenafil, to achieve a satisfactory erection.

The duration of action of the different PDE5 inhibitors has been well documented in all premarketing clinical trials. Initially, it was reported that sildenafil and vardenafil have a short duration of action.

### Sustained efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil, a highly potent selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, in men with erectile dysfunction: Results of a randomized, double-blind, 26-week placebo-controlled pivotal trial [^115DUTPi]. Urology (2003). High credibility.

The durability of key efficacy response parameters and the safety of vardenafil were evaluated in a pivotal trial conducted in a broad population of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) in North America. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, fixed-dose, parallel-group, 6-month comparison study, men over 18 years of age with ED for more than 6 months received 5-mg, 10-mg, and 20-mg doses of vardenafil as needed for up to 26 weeks.

The primary efficacy variables were:

- International index of erectile function (IIEF)-Erectile function (EF) domain scores
- Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) mean per-patient success rates for penetration (SEP question 2) and maintenance of erections (SEP question 3).

Safety data were also collected over time. Improvement in all primary efficacy variables was observed in all vardenafil groups versus placebo. These improvements occurred early and were either sustained or increased through week 26. Vardenafil in 10-mg and 20-mg doses was significantly superior to placebo at all time points for all efficacy variables (P < 0.01), and all doses were superior to placebo at endpoint (P < 0.001).

Most treatment-emergent adverse events (headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and rhinitis) were mild or moderate in intensity, and incidence generally decreased over time. All three doses of vardenafil were superior to placebo across all primary efficacy variables and all study time points in a broad range of patients with ED, regardless of etiology or severity. Vardenafil was well tolerated. These results demonstrate that vardenafil provides sustained efficacy in treating ED.

Vardenafil was evaluated in four major double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel design, multicenter trials involving 2,431 men aged 20 to 83 years (mean age 57 years; 78% White, 7% Black, 2% Asian, 3% Hispanic, and 10% Other/Unknown). The doses of vardenafil in these studies were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. Two trials were conducted in the general erectile dysfunction (ED) population, and two were conducted in special ED populations: one in patients with diabetes mellitus and another in post-prostatectomy patients. Vardenafil was administered without regard to meals on an as-needed basis to men with ED, many of whom had multiple other medical conditions. The primary endpoints were assessed at 3 months.

Primary efficacy assessment across all four major trials employed the Erectile Function (EF) Domain score from the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire, along with two questions from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) concerning the ability to achieve vaginal penetration (SEP2) and to maintain an erection long enough for successful intercourse (SEP3).

In all four fixed-dose efficacy trials, vardenafil demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the EF Domain, SEP2, and SEP3 scores compared to placebo. The mean baseline EF Domain score in these trials was 11.8 (with scores ranging from 0 to 30, where lower scores represent more severe disease). Vardenafil (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg) was effective across all age categories (< 45, 45 to < 65, and ≥ 65 years) and was also effective regardless of race (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Other/Unknown).

### Vardenafil [^1153sz3C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Effect of other drugs on vardenafil**:

	- **In vitro studies**: Studies in human liver microsomes showed that vardenafil is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4/5, and to a lesser degree by CYP2C9. Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to reduce vardenafil clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- **In vivo studies**:

		- **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) produced a tenfold increase in vardenafil AUC and a fourfold increase in maximum concentration (Cmax) when co-administered with vardenafil (5 mg) in healthy volunteers. A 5-mg vardenafil dose should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with 200 mg once daily ketoconazole. Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of vardenafil should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)].

		- **Indinavir interaction**: Indinavir (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with vardenafil 10 mg resulted in a sixteenfold increase in vardenafil AUC, a sevenfold increase in vardenafil Cmax, and a twofold increase in vardenafil half-life. It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg vardenafil dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with indinavir [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of a sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association with the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Sexually transmitted disease**: Inform patients that vardenafil offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counsel patients that protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), should be considered.

- **Dose adjustment**: Inform patients that the recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg. The dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg based on efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is one tablet per day.

### The efficacy and safety of flexible-dose vardenafil (Levitra) in a broad population of European men [^1112Dxqi]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

In fixed-dose studies, vardenafil 5, 10, and 20 mg improves erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction (ED). This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil when used in a flexible-dose regimen.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter trial, 323 patients were randomly assigned to receive vardenafil 10 mg or placebo. After 4 weeks, patients could switch to 5 mg or 20 mg (or the corresponding placebo) or remain on 10 mg for an additional 4 weeks. Dose-switching was optional for the last 4 weeks. Efficacy variables included the IIEF-EF domain score, GAQ, and the percentage of positive responses to SEP2/SEP3 questions.

- **Results**: The IIEF-EF domain score significantly improved from a baseline of moderate ED (12.6–13.1) to mild ED in men on vardenafil (21.0–24.2) compared with placebo (13.7–15.6) at weeks 4, 8, 12, and the last observation carried forward (LOCF) (p < 0.005 vs. placebo). A significantly greater proportion of men receiving vardenafil at weeks 4, 8, 12, and LOCF reported improved erections (80–86% vs. 21–36% for placebo, p < 0.005). Successful SEP2 rates increased after vardenafil, reaching 84% at weeks 8 and 12 vs. 49–53% receiving placebo (p < 0.005 vs. placebo). Vardenafil improved successful SEP3 rates, ranging from 58% to 74% compared to 22–34% for placebo. The most common adverse events, flushing and headache, were generally mild and transient.

- **Conclusion**: In this flexible dose study, vardenafil was well-tolerated and produced clinically relevant improvements in erectile function in men with ED.

### Vardenafil [^111aAoLX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including vardenafil, and seek medical attention in the event of sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5–11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥ 50.

An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.20). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of "crowded" optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies.

Neither the rare postmarketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors.

### Vardenafil [^111sGDSd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Physicians should advise patients to stop taking all PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association with the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Alpha-blockers**: Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly, leading to symptomatic hypotension (for example, fainting) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

	- Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.
	- In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended starting dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### SPL drug information for vardenafil hydrochloride [^112cN4Di]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of vardenafil hydrochloride PO:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias, angina, and heart failure**: Use extreme caution in patients with a history of cardiac disease. Evaluate cardiovascular status before prescribing vardenafil. Provide appropriate medical intervention for angina, arrhythmias, or heart failure as necessary.

- **Exacerbation of esophageal motility disorders**: Use caution with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or hiatal hernia. Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing GERD or hiatal hernia when using vardenafil. Symptomatic treatment and management of GERD or hiatal hernia symptoms if they occur.

- **Hearing loss**: Use caution with pre-existing hearing impairment. Use vardenafil with caution in patients at risk of hearing loss and avoid concurrent use of ototoxic medications. Discontinue vardenafil and seek immediate medical attention if sudden hearing loss or changes in hearing occur.

- **Priapism**: Use caution in patients with penile structural abnormalities (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease), or who have conditions that may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell disease, leukemia, or multiple myeloma). Advise patients about the risk of priapism and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Prompt medical intervention, including aspiration and irrigation of the corpora cavernosa, may be necessary to treat priapism.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Use extreme caution in patients with conditions that may increase the risk of QT prolongation or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval or cause electrolyte imbalances. Evaluate cardiovascular status.

### Psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes affecting treatment choice in men receiving sildenafil citrate and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^114PCRjg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil are efficacious and well-tolerated treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED), preference studies have shown that patients may favor one medication over the other.

- **Aim**: To determine whether psychosocial outcomes differed when men with ED received tadalafil compared with sildenafil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included a treatment preference question, Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), and Drug Attribute Questionnaire.

- **Methods**: Randomized, open-label, crossover study. After a 4-week baseline, men with ED (N = 367; mean age = 54 years; naïve to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy) were randomized to receive tadalafil for 12 weeks then sildenafil for 12 weeks, or vice versa (8-week dose optimization/4-week assessment phases). During dose optimization, patients started with 10 mg tadalafil or 25 or 50 mg sildenafil and could titrate to their optimal dose (10 or 20 mg tadalafil; 25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil). Medications were taken as needed. Patients completing both 12-week periods chose which medication to continue during an 8-week extension.

- **Results**: Of 291 men completing both treatment periods, 71% (N = 206) chose tadalafil and 29% (N = 85) chose sildenafil (P < 0.001) for the 8-week extension. When taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil, men had higher mean endpoint scores on PAIRS Sexual Self-Confidence (tadalafil = 2.91 vs. sildenafil = 2.75; P < 0.001) and Spontaneity (tadalafil = 3.32 vs. sildenafil = 3.17; P < 0.001) domains and a lower mean endpoint score on time concerns.

### Vardenafil allows successful intercourse initiated rapidly after dosing in Japanese patients with diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction [^114rjRRH]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Vardenafil is reported to improve success rates in the maintenance of an erection sufficient for the completion of intercourse (SEP-3) compared with placebo in erectile dysfunction (ED) patients who attempted intercourse as early as 15 minutes after dosing. However, these data were based on general ED patients, using the time from administration to initiation of intercourse. It is unclear whether the results can be applied to difficult-to-treat ED patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM), with the time between dosing and insertion into the vagina.

- **Aim**: To determine whether the early onset of activity with vardenafil is also achievable in ED patients with DM.

- **Methods**: Data from a 12-week Phase III clinical trial (randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison) in Japanese men with ED and DM were used for analysis. In this study, patients received vardenafil 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo, and were instructed to start sexual activity 1 hour after dosing. Mean per-patient SEP-3 success rates (intent-to-treat; ITT population), based on the patient diary question, were calculated by the time between dosing and insertion. The least-squares means and nominal P-values for differences versus placebo were derived by analysis of covariance with terms for baseline.

- **Main outcome measures**: SEP-3 success rates in each time interval.

- **Results**: The majority of inserts occurred between 60–90 minutes after dosing, but 100 of inserts in 52 patients occurred in the first 30 minutes. SEP-3 success rates in patients who inserted in each interval from 0–15 minutes.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate patient preference between tadalafil and sildenafil [^113AtnE5]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To assess patient preference for erectile dysfunction treatment, the study compared sildenafil and tadalafil, each administered with their respective dosing instructions. It also aimed to evaluate preference for either sildenafil or tadalafil dosing instructions during tadalafil therapy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover study consisting of four treatment arms. Because the dosing instructions for sildenafil and tadalafil are different, a unique methodology using sham placebo arms was employed to maintain the blind. To assess drug preference, 219 patients were randomized to either sildenafil 50 mg or tadalafil 20 mg, with dosing instructions reflecting their respective product profiles. To assess dosing instruction preference during tadalafil therapy, 46 patients were randomized to tadalafil 20 mg with either tadalafil or sildenafil dosing instructions. After 12 weeks, patients were crossed-over. After 4 weeks of each treatment, all patients following sildenafil dosing instructions were offered the opportunity for an upward dose titration. In a double-blind fashion, all patients who requested an upward titration received additional capsules. To mimic the pattern of dose usage observed in clinical practice, the number of patients who received additional double-blind active medication was limited to 35% of patients taking sildenafil in each treatment period in each country. Following the crossover treatment period, patients chose their preferred double-blind treatment with dosing instructions to receive in the 12-week extension period.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, including the Patient Information and Instructions for Use. Inform them about the contraindication of Revatio with the regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. It is also important for patients to know that sildenafil is marketed as Viagra for erectile dysfunction, and those taking Revatio should not take Viagra or other PDE-5 inhibitors.

Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes while taking Revatio, as this may be a sign of NAION. Additionally, they should be prompted to seek medical attention promptly if they experience a sudden decrease or loss of hearing while taking the medication. Such events may include symptoms like tinnitus and dizziness.

### Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in erectile dysfunction: The proper drug for the proper patient [^1137F5N7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a very common multidimensional disorder affecting men worldwide. Physical illness, reaction to life stresses, or an unhappy couple relationship can influence clinical outcomes. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are recognized as efficacious and well-tolerated, and they are the first-line treatment for ED. Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are the most widely used and studied PDE5 inhibitors. Data acquired during a routine diagnostic workup for ED should be considered when choosing the best PDE5 inhibitor for the individual patient. This approach helps in creating an individualized treatment plan, moving beyond "experience-based" subjective opinion and unfounded ideas and prejudice regarding currently available drugs.

- **Aim**: As the process of matching a given patient's profile to any selected PDE5 inhibitor often relies more on a physician's personal convictions than on solid evidence, the aim of this review is to identify the main clinical, demographic, and relational factors influencing the choice of the PDE5 inhibitor for the treatment of ED.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search and treatment guidelines were evaluated in a systematic manner.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main clinical, cultural, and demographical factors to be considered for the treatment of ED have been identified.

- **Results**: Main factors influencing the choice of the treatment for ED have been described. A short list of items that may help in choosing the right PDE5 inhibitor for the treatment of different patients in daily clinical practice has been provided.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114tjSqo]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The other major difference was in the reporting of outcomes of studies, which varied greatly between the three PDE-5 inhibitors. Common outcomes were responses to a global question about improved erections (e.g. "Has the treatment you have been taking over the past four weeks improved your erections?"), and scores and change in score for the erectile function domain. Some outcomes were frequently reported in trials of one treatment, but not others. For example, final scores and changes from baseline for IIEF questions 3 and 4 were reported for most sildenafil, but not tadalafil or vardenafil, trials.

There were clear differences in the philosophy of reporting efficacy and harm, principally between the first PDE-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, and the subsequent ones, tadalafil and vardenafil. We could find no explanation for this, nor any philosophical discussion about the clinical and practical importance of different outcomes. Few studies provided an estimate of how many men had an outcome approximating erections sufficiently rigid for penetration followed by successful intercourse. This simple pragmatic outcome is more relevant to affected men, their partners, and their professional advisers than an average movement on a scale like IIEF, which itself comprises a number of different questions. Useful outcomes, like the number of men in whom the proportion of successful attempts at sexual intercourse was more than 40% or 60% or more, known to be recorded in clinical trial reports for sildenafil, were almost never reported in published papers.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114zqX7B]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

**Relationship between dosing and intercourse**: There was generally no information on intervals between dosing and timing of intercourse, either for speed of onset of effect or duration of effect. The only consistent information concerning the timing of intercourse is from four studies comparing tadalafil 20 mg with placebo. The majority of attempts and successful attempts occurred within four hours, and about 90% within 12 hours. Success rates with tadalafil 20 mg and placebo did not differ, whatever time intercourse occurred. No other studies provided useful information relating to timing of intercourse after dosing.

### Vardenafil [^112MVWZN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Blood pressure effects (standing SBP) in normotensive men on a stable dose of tamsulosin 0.4 mg following simultaneous administration of vardenafil 10 mg, vardenafil 20 mg, or placebo are shown in Figure 4.

- **Mean change from baseline**: Figure 4 depicts the mean change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure (mmHg) over a 6-hour interval following simultaneous administration of vardenafil 10 mg (Stage 1), vardenafil 20 mg (Stage 2), or placebo with a stable dose of tamsulosin 0.4 mg in normotensive BPH patients.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of single doses of 5 mg vardenafil (Stage 1) and 10 mg vardenafil (Stage 2) compared to placebo when administered to a single cohort of BPH patients (n = 24) on stable therapy with alfuzosin 10 mg daily for at least four weeks. The design was a randomized, double-blind, three-period cross-over study. Vardenafil or placebo was administered 4 hours after the administration of alfuzosin. Blood pressure and pulse were evaluated over a 10-hour interval after dosing of vardenafil or placebo.

- **Patient outcomes**: One patient experienced a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of more than 30 mmHg after administration of vardenafil 5 mg film-coated tablet and vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablet. No instances of standing systolic blood pressure less than 85 mmHg were observed during this study. Four patients, one dosed with placebo, two dosed with vardenafil 5 mg film-coated tablets, and one dosed with vardenafil 10 mg film-coated tablets, reported dizziness. Blood pressure effects (standing SBP) in normotensive men on a stable dose of alfuzosin 10 mg were observed and documented.

### Can an educational program optimize PDE5i therapy? A study of Canadian primary care practices [^1145NTGK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The importance of patient instructions designed to optimize therapy with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) has recently been demonstrated.

- **Aim**: To evaluate the impact of an educational program for new sildenafil users against usual ED management in Canadian primary care practices.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, 6-month cluster randomized prospective study was conducted across Canada in general practitioners' offices where sites were randomized to receive a treatment optimization program (TOP) tool at visit 1 (TOP sites) or not to receive the TOP tool (non-TOP sites) while continuing with usual practice. Study participants were men seeking medical attention for ED and who were sildenafil naïve. The TOP tool consisted of a tear-off sheet, a brochure, and a video. Study drug was not provided to the patients. Sildenafil samples and prescriptions were dispensed as per usual care practices.

- **Main outcome measures**: The Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire was used to determine treatment satisfaction at visit 2 (month 3) and visit 3 (month 6). Patient and physician satisfaction with the TOP tool was assessed using self-reported questionnaires.

- **Results**: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 2,573 patients from 231 primary care sites. At visits 2 and 3, treatment satisfaction with sildenafil was high with almost 9 patients out of 10 satisfied with treatment. No significant statistical differences were observed in the EDITS scores between the TOP and the non-TOP groups.

### Comparison of pharmacokinetics of vardenafil administered using an ultrasonic nebulizer for inhalation vs a single 10-mg oral tablet [^1119dQzQ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The delivery of vardenafil for the improvement of erectile function via the inhaled route of administration may be advantageous, as this method avoids extensive first-pass metabolism. This could therefore increase the bioavailability, enhancing the reliability of absorption and shortening the time for the pharmacological onset of activity. A unique nebulizer design has been developed by the sponsor, Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd, capable of delivering relatively large volumes of the drug.

- **Aim**: The primary objective of this Phase 1 study was to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of vardenafil 10-mg tablet and a single dose of vardenafil solution administered via inhalation using an ultrasonic nebulizer device. The secondary objective was to assess the safety of vardenafil administered via inhalation using an ultrasonic nebulizer device.

- **Methods**: A two-part study was conducted in healthy volunteers. A dose-ranging study was performed in two subjects to determine the appropriate inhalational dose, followed by an open, randomized, crossover, single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 12 subjects comparing a single 10-mg oral dose to the inhalation dose.

- **Main outcome measures**: Cmax, Cmax/Dose, Tmax, ke, t1/2, AUC0-t, AUCt-∞, AUC0-∞, AUC0-∞, AUC0-∞/Dose, and % area extrapolated.

- **Results**: The two treatments are not bioequivalent, with vardenafil absorbed and eliminated faster and with less variability using the nebulizer for drug delivery. Administration through the inhalational route was not associated with any clinically significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate.

### Real-life safety and efficacy of vardenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction-results from 30,010 U.S. patients [^1117J8jM]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical trials show that vardenafil produces effective and satisfactory first-dose success rates and reliability for erection and intercourse in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Aim**: This study was conducted to evaluate real-life efficacy, safety, and acceptance of vardenafil in men with ED.

- **Methods**: This open-label, prospective study, conducted in 6,740 U.S. centers, included an initial visit and one or two follow-up visits within a 2-month period of the first vardenafil dose. Vardenafil was administered in 5–20 mg doses.

- **Main outcome measures**: Efficacy variables included first-dose success rates for vaginal penetration, maintenance of erection, and satisfaction based on physician and patient assessments. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs).

- **Results**: A total of 30,010 men were included in the safety/intent-to-treat (S/ITT) analysis, with 26,043 men in the adjusted S/ITT population. Vardenafil improved erectile function in 78% of men, with 75% rating overall efficacy as "satisfying" or "very satisfying". The overall rates of successful penetration and maintenance with vardenafil following the first dose were 78% and 68%, respectively. For men with mild and moderate ED, first-dose success rates for penetration were 89% and 82%, respectively, and for maintenance, 82% and 71%, respectively. First-dose penetration and maintenance of erection rates were 76% and 66%, respectively, for men with self-reported hypertension, and 70% and 60%, respectively, for men with diabetes mellitus. At study end, 67% of patients preferred to continue using vardenafil.

### Vardenafil increases penile rigidity and tumescence in men with erectile dysfunction following a single oral dose [^112yfbZn]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effect of two doses of vardenafil hydrochloride on penile rigidity and tumescence, while determining the pharmacokinetics, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one patients with erectile dysfunction completed three oral single-dose regimens (placebo, 20 mg, and 40 mg vardenafil) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way cross-over study. Penile rigidity and tumescence were measured at the base and tip with a Rigiscan for up to 2 hours after dosing. The period included three 20-minute repeated episodes of visual sexual stimulation. Blood samples were taken periodically up to 24 hours after dosing.

- **Results**: After 20 mg and 40 mg vardenafil, the mean duration of > 60% rigidity at the base of the penis was greater than after placebo by 42.9 minutes (95% CI 29.3–56.4) and by 49.3 minutes (95% CI 35.7–62.9), respectively (p < 0.001), and greater than after placebo by 34.6 minutes (95% CI 22.1–47.1) for both doses at the tip. Additionally, significantly greater rigidity activity units and tumescence activity units were found for both doses compared with placebo (p < 0.001). The plasma concentrations of vardenafil increased rapidly, with a median tₘₐₓ of about 40 minutes and a mean t₁/₂ of 4.4–4.8 hours. Relative bioavailability was slightly higher for the 40-mg dose than for the 20-mg dose. The treatments were well tolerated, although slightly more adverse events, primarily headache, flushing, and nasal congestion, were seen with the 40-mg dose compared with placebo.

- **Conclusion**: The findings confirm that vardenafil was able to generate stronger erections of longer duration than placebo under conditions of visual stimulation.

### Cialis [^116MGY3n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Do not split Cialis tablets; the entire dose should be taken.

- **Cialis for use as needed for erectile dysfunction**: The recommended starting dose of Cialis for use as needed in most patients is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day in most patients. Cialis for use as needed was shown to improve erectile function compared to placebo up to 36 hours following dosing; therefore, when advising patients on optimal use of Cialis, this should be taken into consideration.

- **Cialis for once daily use for erectile dysfunction**: The recommended starting dose of Cialis for once daily use is 2.5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity. The Cialis dose for once daily use may be increased to 5 mg, based on individual efficacy and tolerability.

- **Cialis for once daily use for benign prostatic hyperplasia**: The recommended dose of Cialis for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day. When therapy for BPH is initiated with Cialis and finasteride, the recommended dose of Cialis for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day for up to 26 weeks.

- **Cialis for once daily use for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia**: The recommended dose of Cialis for once daily use is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day, without regard to timing of sexual activity.

### Pharmacokinetics comparison of vardenafil as administered by an intranasal spray formulation vs a 10-mg oral tablet [^1168VyPE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Oral vardenafil (VDF) tablet is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), but intranasal administration with a suitable formulation can lead to a faster onset of action and offer more convenient planning for ED treatment.

- **Aim**: The primary purpose of the present pilot clinical study was to determine whether intranasal VDF with an alcohol-based formulation can result in more "user-friendly pharmacokinetics" as compared with oral tablet administration.

- **Methods**: This single-dose randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 healthy young volunteers receiving VDF as a 10-mg oral tablet or 3.38-mg intranasal spray. Multiple blood concentrations were obtained, and VDF concentrations were determined with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters following each treatment were compared and adverse events assessed.

- **Outcomes**: Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained: apparent elimination rate constant, elimination half-life, peak concentration, peak time, total area under the curve, and relative bioavailability.

- **Results**: Although mean apparent elimination rate constant, elimination half-life, peak concentration, and total area under the curve were similar between intranasal and oral administration, the median peak time from intranasal was much shorter (10 vs. 58 minutes, p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters was also less with intranasal than oral administration. The relative bioavailability of intranasal to oral was 1.67. Intranasal VDF caused transient but tolerable local na

### Vardenafil improves satisfaction rates, depressive symptomatology, and self-confidence in a broad population of men with erectile dysfunction [^1116ZWGJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Vardenafil is a potent and selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies have previously established the efficacy and tolerability of vardenafil.

- **Aim**: To assess, besides the usual measures of efficacy, the quality of erection, satisfaction with the sexual experience, symptoms of depression, and overall confidence.

- **Methods**: This 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled flexible-dose study assessed patients from the general ED population. Patients underwent a 4-week treatment-free period before randomization to vardenafil or matching placebo. The initial dosage was vardenafil 10 mg for 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, patients could switch to 5 or 20 mg (or corresponding placebo), or remain on 10 mg for an additional 4 weeks; dose switching was also optional for the last 4 weeks. This paper describes per-patient success in satisfaction with hardness of erection, satisfaction with overall sexual experience, effect on overall self-confidence, and an assessment of symptoms of depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.

- **Results**: Mean per-patient satisfaction rates with erection hardness increased after vardenafil treatment to 43%, 59%, and 63% at weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively, compared to placebo with 10%, 21%, and 23% (all P < 0.005 vs. placebo). Vardenafil also improved mean per-patient overall satisfaction to 50–65% over the 4–12 week study period compared with 17–28% for placebo (P < 0.005). Symptoms of depression were statistically significantly reduced.

### Management of sildenafil treatment failures [^114o1jcA]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Although oral type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for the majority of erectile dysfunction causes due to their high efficacy, ease of use, and acceptable safety profile, there are some individuals who fail to respond, primarily because of end-organ failure. This review discusses the management of sildenafil failures in light of recent advances.

Sildenafil failures can be attributed to either a lack of efficacy or side effects; issues may involve the physician, patient, and his partner. Physicians may contribute to sildenafil failure and discontinuation due to inadequate instructions, lack of adequate follow-up, suboptimal dosing, inadequate trial duration, and insufficient clarification about safety issues. Studies have demonstrated that progression of endothelial dysfunction and diminished cavernosal smooth-muscle content are recognized organic factors that contribute to end-organ dysfunction and ultimately treatment failure.

Proper counseling, medication optimization, and modifying associated risk factors can lead to success in men who initially failed sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction. Other treatment modalities that may be considered when sildenafil failure occurs include vacuum devices, intraurethral and intracavernosal administration of vasoactive drugs alone or in combination with sildenafil. Penile prosthesis implantation is considered a last resort if all first-line and second-line therapies fail.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^113A1ecY]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The first stage was a detailed analysis of outcomes for each intervention, followed by a comparison between interventions where there was sufficient information to make the comparison valid. To make comparisons between different interventions, similar outcomes and similar intensities of intervention had to be compared in similar patients. Only those outcomes with a reasonably high and consistent reporting frequency were available for comparison.

- **Individual analyses**: Results for continuous efficacy outcomes for sildenafil are shown in Table 4. Average results for percentage successful attempts at intercourse, for the erectile function domain score, and for the change in the erectile function domain score from baseline were consistently available for the optimised dose and for some trials with a fixed dose. Combined data for 50 mg and 100 mg fixed doses and dose-optimised regimens are reported (50/100).

- **Results for dichotomous variables**: Efficacy and adverse events for sildenafil are shown in Table 5. Data were available for most studies. The analysis combined dose-optimised regimens with a 100 mg fixed dose since the majority of patients on dose-optimised regimens were on 100 mg.

NNT is given in standard font, NNTp in bold, and NNH in bold italic. No NNT/NNTp/NNH was calculated unless there was a statistically significant difference. For efficacy, the NNT for improved erections was the same at 1.9 for all doses.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought randomised trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with placebo or active comparator, in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomized trial.

For inclusion, a trial had to be randomised and double-blind, use one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in the home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of 10 men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports were retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilizing reporting of randomization, blinding, and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and the country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text. The following outcomes were sought particularly:

- **Effectiveness**: As measured by improvement in erectile function, assessed using validated scales.
- **Adverse events**: Including but not limited to headache, flushing, and dyspepsia, reported by frequency to assess the safety profile of each PDE-5 inhibitor.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^1118po7j]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

There were 35 included studies using sildenafil, treating 7,135 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. One study was analyzed as two trials. Of the men, 3,279 received placebo and 3,856 sildenafil, of whom all but 90 took licensed doses of 25 to 100 mg. Optimized dosing with 25–100 mg was most used (2,546 men), followed by 100 mg (506) or 50 mg (370). All were placebo-controlled with no active comparator. Quality scores were high, with 11 trials scoring 5 out of 5 points, 17 scoring 4 points, six 3 points, and two 2 points. One further study used a withdrawal model after successful treatment, and information from the 205 men in this study was not included in this analysis.

There were eight included studies using tadalafil, treating 2,071 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of these, 632 received placebo and 1,439 tadalafil, of whom all but 35 took licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg. All were placebo-controlled with no active comparator. Doses of 20 mg (1,258) or 10 mg (109) were most frequent, with no dose-optimized studies. Quality scores were high, with two trials scoring 5 out of 5 points, one scoring 4 points, four 3 points, and one 2 points. One further trial was a population dose-response study and was not included.

There were seven included studies with vardenafil, treating 3,374 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of these, 1,067 received placebo and 2,307 vardenafil, all at licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg.

### Evaluation of vardenafil and sildenafil on cardiac repolarization [^113copF9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This novel study evaluated the effects of vardenafil and sildenafil on QT and corrected QT (QTc) duration using a model that minimizes experimental error to obtain the most accurate assessment of observed QTc effects. A placebo-controlled and positive-controlled, period-balanced, double-blinded, six-way crossover study evaluated therapeutic and supratherapeutic oral doses of vardenafil (10 and 80 mg, respectively) and sildenafil (50 and 400 mg, respectively), therapeutic doses of moxifloxacin (400 mg), and a placebo in 58 healthy men (mean age 53 years), with dosing every three days.

Six replicate, 12-lead, digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded at three time points before and five time points after dosing to cover the time course of maximum exposure to study drugs and their metabolites. An independent laboratory blindly analyzed approximately 17,000 ECGs. For the placebo, the mean change in QTcF (Fridericia) duration one hour after dose (approximate Tmax of vardenafil and sildenafil) was 0 ms (± 0.7 SD). QT/QTc variability was small across regimens, indicating statistically powerful results. Moxifloxacin demonstrated an expected 8-ms mean change and was the only drug to prolong absolute QT.

Placebo-corrected mean changes in QTcF duration (90% confidence interval) at one hour after dose were 8 ms (range 6 to 9) for vardenafil 10 mg and 6 ms (range 5 to 8) for sildenafil 50 mg. QTci (linear and nonlinear per patient) yielded similar trends: 4 ms (range 3 to 6) for vardenafil 10 mg and 4 ms (range 2 to 5) for sildenafil 50 mg. Dose response demonstrated very shallow QTc relations.

### Evaluation of current errors within the administration of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors after more than 10 years of use [^112fnVQF]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to detect errors in the administration of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) and evaluate the potential recovery percentage of patients for oral therapy with different subtypes of PDE5is through a re-education program.

- **Methods**: Two hundred fifty patients referred to the andrology unit were prospectively analyzed. These patients primarily complained of erectile dysfunction despite PDE5i treatment. The International Index of Erectile Function was employed to assess erectile function. A structured interview was developed to identify the most frequent errors in PDE5i administration. A re-education program was offered to patients with incomplete or incorrect PDE5i use, as identified through the structured interview, categorizing them into true nonresponders or false nonresponders. Lastly, the study analyzed the percentage of patients who could be recovered for oral therapy with alternative PDE5is.

- **Results**: A total of 172 patients (69%) exhibited some error in drug administration, with the most common error being the failure to try more than one PDE5i (41%). The re-education program was offered to these nonresponders, and 115 (66.9%) agreed to participate. Of these, 27 (23.5%) did not respond to the re-education program and were classified as true nonresponders, whereas 88 (76.5%) responded positively to treatment and were thus included in the false nonresponder group.

- **Conclusion**: Two-thirds of patients referred to our andrology unit and categorized as nonresponders were actually using PDE5is under suboptimal conditions. By providing more accurate information, the re-education program successfully recovered nearly 76% of these patients for effective PDE5i therapy.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114AtCNc]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Results for continuous efficacy outcomes for vardenafil are detailed in the research. Average results for the percentage of successful attempts at intercourse, the erectile function domain score, and the change in the erectile function domain score from baseline were consistently available for the optimized dose and for some trials with a fixed dose. Combined data for 10 mg and 20 mg fixed doses and dose-optimized regimens are reported.

- **Dichotomous variables of efficacy and adverse events**: The analysis combined dose-optimized regimens with the 20 mg fixed dose, as most patients on dose-optimized regimens were taking 20 mg.

	- **Efficacy**: The number needed to treat (NNT) for improved erections was consistent at 2.0 for all doses above 5 mg, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and justified combining those doses. Improved erections in 2,856 men were reported in 71% of men on vardenafil and 22% on placebo (Figure 1). The NNT was calculated to be 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 2.2).

	- **Withdrawal outcomes**: Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg with dose-optimized regimens, both all-cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals were reported in 500 to 2300 men and were lower with vardenafil than with placebo. NNTp values were 7.7 (6.0 to 11) and 11 (9.0 to 16) respectively.

In summary, vardenafil showed consistent efficacy across various dosage regimens, with a lower incidence of withdrawals due to all causes and lack of efficacy compared to placebo.

### Vardenafil, a new phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes: a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled fixed-dose study [^117Mw2Fm]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vardenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with diabetes. In this prospective multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled fixed-dose parallel-group phase III trial, 452 patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and ED were randomized to take 10 mg or 20 mg vardenafil or placebo as needed for 12 weeks. Efficacy responses were assessed by International Index of Erectile Function domain scores, rates of vaginal penetration and successful intercourse, and a global assessment question (GAQ) about erection improvement during the previous 4 weeks.

After 12 weeks of treatment, a dose-dependent improvement (P = 0.02) in erections was noted for the GAQ, with 57% and 72% of men taking 10 mg or 20 mg vardenafil, respectively, reporting improved erections, in contrast to 13% after taking placebo (P < 0.0001). For the erectile function domain, dose-dependent final scores (P = 0.03) for the 10-mg and 20-mg dose were 17.1 and 19.0 compared with 12.6 for placebo (P < 0.0001). Both vardenafil doses significantly enhanced the rates of successful penetration (P < 0.0001) and successful intercourse (P < 0.0001) compared with placebo. Vardenafil treatment was effective in increasing intercourse success rates at all levels of baseline ED severity, at each level of plasma HbA(1c), and for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily mild to moderate headache (≤ 13%), flushing (≤ 10%), and rhinitis (≤ 10%).

Vardenafil statistically improved erections in men with diabetes experiencing ED.

### Positive effect of counseling and dose adjustment in patients with erectile dysfunction who failed treatment with sildenafil [^115XCG1q]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Many patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) stop using sildenafil due to subjective failure. This study examined whether counseling and maximal dosing (100 mg) could achieve better treatment compliance and possibly improve treatment outcomes.

- **Material and methods**: Patients were recruited by newspaper advertisements and referred to five ED centers throughout the country. Details about their previous experiences with sildenafil were recorded. Following an explicit explanation about the nature and action of the drug, participants were offered entry into the study. Instructions on drug use were provided during each visit in which four 100 mg sildenafil tablets were dispensed. Treatment outcomes were assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire after taking 4 and 8 tablets. In two ED centers, a short video with sexual counseling content was added between visits.

- **Results**: The study cohort comprised 220 patients aged 27–88 years. The majority reported having received limited or no instructions on drug use when sildenafil was first prescribed. A significant increase in IIEF erectile function domain scores (EFDS) between visits 1, 2, and 3 was observed (10.96 ± 0.40, 16.73 ± 0.51, and 17.82 ± 0.55 mean ± SE, respectively), with 23.6% of the study patients achieving normal erectile function at the end of the study. The parameters of age and initial severity of ED most influenced treatment success.

In conclusion, counseling and dose adjustment were directly influential in achieving an excellent response to a second trial of sildenafil in patients.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ejDpg]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

All studies provided background information on participants. Typically, men had to have a history of erectile dysfunction for at least three to six months, and the average age of men was generally in the mid-50s or older. Some studies had an enriched enrollment in which previous unsuccessful treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. This applied to five of eight tadalafil studies and six of seven vardenafil studies [see Additional file 1], but none of the sildenafil studies. One vardenafil study included only men previously unresponsive to sildenafil.

Studies almost always documented that PDE-5 inhibitors were to be taken as needed, with a maximum of one treatment a day. For sildenafil and vardenafil, there was the additional instruction that the dose be taken about an hour before intercourse. Some studies provided information on the number of doses actually taken. Many of the dose-optimized studies reported the proportion of men on the maximum dose at the end of the study, which was always over 50%, and typically ranged from 60–80%. Trial duration was typically four to 12 weeks, with 12 weeks being the most common duration.

A number of different conditions causing erectile dysfunction were studied. All three PDE-5 inhibitors had a similar proportion of men with mixed etiology (organic, psychogenic, or mixed) and diabetes. Erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy was studied for tadalafil and vardenafil, but not sildenafil. None of the sildenafil studies after prostatectomy could be included, mainly because they were not randomized.

### Vardenafil [^111eEjmt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mean change from baseline in blood pressure**: The mean change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure (mmHg) was measured over a 6-hour interval following either the simultaneous or 6-hour separated administration of vardenafil 10 mg, vardenafil 20 mg, or placebo with terazosin (10 mg) in healthy volunteers.

- **Comparison with tamsulosin**: Similarly, the mean change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure (mmHg) was observed following the administration of vardenafil 10 mg, vardenafil 20 mg, or placebo with tamsulosin (0.4 mg) in healthy volunteers.

- **Effects on cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of 10 mg and 80 mg vardenafil on the QT interval was evaluated in a single-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) crossover study involving 59 healthy males (81% White, 12% Black, 7% Hispanic) aged 45 to 60 years. QT interval measurements were taken one hour post-dose, as this approximates the peak vardenafil concentration. The 80 mg dose (four times the highest recommended dose) was chosen to yield plasma concentrations covering those observed upon co-administration of a low-dose of vardenafil (5 mg) with ritonavir (600 mg BID). Of the CYP3A4 inhibitors studied, ritonavir causes the most significant drug-drug interaction with vardenafil. The results summarized include the mean uncorrected QT and mean corrected QT interval (QTc) using different methods of correction (Fridericia and a linear individual correction method) one hour post-dose. No single correction method is definitively more valid than the others.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^115zvtRd]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Withdrawal from studies for any cause, due to lack of effect, or because of adverse events was commonly reported. However, the number of men with at least one adverse event and the occurrence of severe adverse events were documented in only a minority of trials. Serious adverse events were reported more frequently in tadalafil and vardenafil trials than in sildenafil trials, perhaps reflecting the recency of studies. The use of a cut-off level for reporting individual adverse events limited the available information for these outcomes.

Analysis of the individual PDE-5 inhibitors showed that the two top doses (including dose-optimization schedules) had very similar efficacy for all three interventions. This consistency justified pooling information from the two top doses.

Using this strategy to compare the three PDE-5 inhibitors demonstrated remarkable consistency between them based on available data for any commonly reported outcome. Absolute rates for placebo varied little, showing no major difference between patients studied. The only exception to this was for withdrawals, where tadalafil and vardenafil studies had higher withdrawal rates with both placebo and PDE-5 inhibitors than did sildenafil. There was no obvious reason for this. It was perhaps surprising that sildenafil compared well with tadalafil and vardenafil given the much greater number of conditions studied, the wider geographical spread, and that tadalafil and vardenafil studies used a form of enriched enrollment. Overall, sildenafil offered the most information and a trend towards better efficacy and lower withdrawal rates.

### Vardenafil in pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115xb6r8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated efficacy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), monotherapy with these agents has not been conclusively shown to reduce clinical worsening events.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor vardenafil in Chinese patients with PAH.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 66 patients with PAH were randomized 2:1 to vardenafil (5 mg once daily for 4 weeks, then 5 mg twice daily; n = 44) or placebo (n = 22) for 12 weeks. Patients completing this phase were then treated with open-label vardenafil (5 mg twice daily) for a further 12 weeks.

- **Measurements and main results**: At Week 12, the mean placebo-corrected 6-minute walking distance increased with vardenafil (69 m; P < 0.001), and this improvement was maintained for at least 24 weeks. Vardenafil also increased the mean placebo-corrected cardiac index (0.39 L·min⁻¹·m⁻²; P = 0.005) and decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (-5.3 mm Hg, P = 0.047; -4.7 Wood U, P = 0.003, respectively) at Week 12. Four patients in the placebo group (20%) and one in the vardenafil group (2.3%) had clinical worsening events (hazard ratio 0.105; 95% confidence interval, 0.012–0.938; P = 0.044). Vardenafil was associated with only mild and transient adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: Vardenafil is effective and well tolerated in patients with PAH at a dose of 5 mg twice daily.

The majority of these subjects experienced reversible back pain, myalgia, and/or "abnormal vision". Single doses up to 80 mg of vardenafil and multiple doses up to 40 mg administered once daily over 4 weeks were tolerated without producing serious adverse side effects.

When 40 mg of vardenafil was administered twice daily, cases of severe back pain were observed. No muscle or neurological toxicity was identified.

In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be taken as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance, as vardenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and not significantly eliminated in the urine.

### Daily vardenafil for 6 months has no detrimental effects on semen characteristics or reproductive hormones in men with normal baseline levels [^115dEY5p]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-choice therapy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Many men in their reproductive years are now using these inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 6 months of treatment with 20 mg vardenafil, compared with 100 mg sildenafil and placebo, on semen characteristics and reproductive hormones in men with and without erectile dysfunction.

- **Materials and methods**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. A total of 200 men with or without erectile dysfunction, able to produce semen samples without erectile dysfunction therapy, aged 25 to 64 years old, were randomized to daily treatment with vardenafil, sildenafil, or placebo for 6 months. The primary variable was the percentage of vardenafil-treated individuals with a 50% or greater decrease in mean sperm concentration from baseline to the 6-month last observation carried forward, compared with placebo-treated individuals.

- **Results**: The between-group difference (vardenafil minus placebo) in the percentage of patients with a 50% or greater decrease in sperm concentration (baseline to 6 months last observation carried forward) was 0.07% (95% CI, -8.53% to 8.39%). Vardenafil also had no clinically significant effects on any other semen parameters or on levels of reproductive hormones, when compared with placebo. Similar data were observed with sildenafil.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrated that vardenafil had no adverse effects on sperm concentration, compared with sildenafil.
