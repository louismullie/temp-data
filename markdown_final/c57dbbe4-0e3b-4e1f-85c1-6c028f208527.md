## Question

ganglion impar nerve block

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ganglion impar nerve block. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomical target and innervation to anchor indications. Then, I should verify the clinical indications and patient selection, including cancer-related pain. Next, I will review the evidence base and quantify expected outcomes. After that, I need to examine technical approaches and imaging guidance, including special alternatives like EUS. I will then assess safety, complications, and risk stratification, including anticoagulation considerations. Finally, I should synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure I double-check any overstatements and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical foundation and innervation pattern. The ganglion impar, also called Walther's ganglion, is the terminal sympathetic ganglion at the convergence of the sympathetic chains, classically located anterior to the sacrococcygeal junction and posterior to the rectum in the presacral space, providing nociceptive and sympathetic innervation to the perineum, distal rectum/anus, distal urethra, vulva/scrotum, and distal vagina, which explains its relevance for perineal and coccygeal pain syndromes [^117PJydo] [^113H69fj] [^114DK2GJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indications before I verify the evidence tiers. For nonmalignant pain, chronic coccydynia refractory to conservative therapy is the most common indication, with supportive data from observational cohorts and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showing clinically meaningful short-, intermediate-, and long-term pain reductions, albeit with very low certainty of evidence, which tempers enthusiasm but supports cautious use in selected patients [^113Hnfc7] [^114Wi3vn] [^1124umxW]. For malignant pain, intractable perineal cancer pain is the primary oncologic indication, and multiple guidelines recommend considering ganglion impar neurolysis in this setting, supported by case series demonstrating substantial pain improvements and opioid-sparing effects, though randomized data are lacking [^116uzLkW] [^113aCRtZ] [^113jthrW].

> I need to check the magnitude and durability of benefit to set expectations. In the 2025 meta-analysis of 391 patients with coccydynia, standardized mean differences in pain were −2.73 at ≤ 3 months, −2.13 at 3–6 months, and −1.86 beyond 6 months, indicating large, clinically relevant effects despite very low certainty, and no serious adverse events were reported across the included studies, which is reassuring but not definitive [^113Hnfc7]. Observational series report success rates commonly exceeding 70–80% for at least 50% pain reduction, with median durations extending to 6–17 months in some cohorts, and repeated blocks can sustain benefit in responders, though heterogeneity and lack of controls limit inference [^114dCKMR] [^1174MAWL] [^1124umxW].

> Next, I should review technical approaches and imaging guidance, and I need to ensure I distinguish diagnostic from neurolytic strategies. The transsacrococcygeal approach through the sacrococcygeal disc is widely favored for its shorter needle path and direct trajectory, typically performed under fluoroscopy with contrast confirmation of retroperitoneal spread, and alternative approaches include intercoccygeal, paracoccygeal, and the original anococcygeal ligament technique, with CT guidance improving accuracy in challenging anatomy and ultrasound serving as an adjunct when fluoroscopic visualization is limited [^117PJydo] [^114Fhesp] [^115mBpse] [^115CYuaj]. Wait, let me verify the EUS option because it is often overlooked; lower endoscopic ultrasound access provides proximity to the presacral space and can be invaluable in patients with obesity, sacrococcygeal fusion, or failed percutaneous attempts, with case series demonstrating feasibility and pain relief, though broader efficacy data are still needed [^115zPCcY] [^114DK2GJ] [^114pm5Mk].

> I will now examine injectate choices and neurolytic escalation. Diagnostic blocks commonly use 2–10 mL of 0.25–0.5% bupivacaine with or without 40 mg methylprednisolone, and responders may proceed to neurolysis with phenol or conventional radiofrequency ablation; pulsed radiofrequency has shown mixed results, with randomized data suggesting inferior durability compared with conventional RF for perineal pain, so I should be cautious in recommending PRF as a definitive therapy [^1116M7MG] [^11232puT] [^116Nb9vY]. Let me double-check the neurolytic evidence in cancer pain; small series and mixed-etiology cohorts report meaningful opioid reductions and pain improvements after phenol neurolysis, but high-quality RCTs are lacking, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection and shared decision-making [^113jthrW] [^112ARFos].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed comprehensively. Serious complications are rare but include rectal perforation, bleeding, infection, and transient bowel or bladder dysfunction; overall, contemporary series report low complication rates when image guidance is used, and the risk profile is favorable compared with more invasive alternatives, though vigilance for retroperitoneal spread and rectal proximity remains essential [^114WKagF] [^117PJydo]. But wait, what if the patient is on anticoagulation? ASIPP 2024 categorizes ganglion impar blocks as low-risk procedures for bleeding, allowing continuation of many antiplatelet agents and selected anticoagulants with individualized risk assessment, which is helpful for patients with cancer-related pain who often require antithrombotics [^1176g3V2] [^113DFbom].

> Let me consider predictive factors for success so I can refine selection. Longer pre-procedure symptom duration and the presence of permanent coccygeal subluxation independently predict lower likelihood of success at 3 months, whereas obesity and gender do not consistently correlate with outcomes; this argues for earlier referral after failed conservative therapy and for integrating dynamic imaging to identify structural drivers when appropriate [^115jNaNT] [^1122Q6Bc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought obesity might blunt efficacy, but the cited predictive study did not find BMI to be a significant predictor, so I should correct that assumption and avoid overattributing poor outcomes to obesity alone [^115jNaNT].

> Next, I should review the procedural algorithm in practical terms. After conservative measures fail, a fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic block with local anesthetic ± steroid is reasonable; a positive response, commonly defined as at least 50% pain reduction, supports proceeding to neurolysis with conventional RF or phenol, while a negative diagnostic block should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis or alternative pain generators such as pudendal neuralgia or sacrococcygeal joint pathology, with imaging correlation guiding next steps [^117PJydo] [^1122Q6Bc]. I should confirm that repeated blocks can be offered to responders; indeed, retreatment at 6–12 month intervals is feasible and can sustain benefit in selected patients, though durability varies and expectations should be tempered by the low-certainty evidence base [^114dCKMR] [^113Hnfc7].

> I will now examine special populations and settings. In patients with advanced pelvic or perineal malignancy, combining ganglion impar neurolysis with superior hypogastric plexus blockade can address dual afferent pathways and may enhance analgesia while reducing opioid requirements, and in those with distorted anatomy or failed percutaneous access, EUS-guided techniques offer a promising alternative route that deserves consideration in multidisciplinary planning [^112ARFos] [^115zPCcY]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this integrated approach; ASPN endorses ganglion impar neurolysis for intractable perineal cancer pain and supports individualized combinations with other plexus interventions when clinically indicated [^116uzLkW] [^113aCRtZ].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. The highest-quality synthesis to date is a 2025 meta-analysis showing large, durable pain reductions for coccydynia but graded as very low certainty due to heterogeneity and lack of RCTs; for cancer-related perineal pain, evidence remains limited to case series and small cohorts, and ongoing randomized trials comparing RF ablation versus phenol neurolysis may clarify optimal neurolytic strategies in partial responders [^113Hnfc7] [^111UJjXD] [^117McGUG]. I should double-check that my conclusions remain proportional to the evidence; yes, while clinical experience and observational data are encouraging, shared decision-making should explicitly communicate uncertainty and the potential need for retreatment [^113Hnfc7].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical pearls are explicit. Use image guidance to confirm midline presacral spread, favor the transsacrococcygeal approach when feasible, consider CT when fluoroscopic visualization is limited or anatomy is variant, and reserve EUS for challenging anatomy or prior failures; screen for anticoagulation per ASIPP risk categories, counsel on realistic timelines for benefit and possible retreatment, and coordinate with oncology, surgery, and radiology for complex cancer pain presentations to optimize outcomes and safety [^117PJydo] [^115mBpse] [^113DFbom] [^115zPCcY].

The **ganglion impar block** is a minimally invasive, image-guided procedure targeting the terminal sympathetic ganglion anterior to the sacrococcygeal junction [^113H69fj] [^113Hnfc7], providing relief for chronic perineal and coccygeal pain [^113H69fj]. It is indicated for **refractory coccydynia** [^113Hnfc7], perineal cancer pain [^116uzLkW], and other sympathetic-mediated pelvic pain syndromes [^1174MAWL]. Common approaches include transsacrococcygeal [^114Fhesp], intercoccygeal, and ultrasound- or CT-guided techniques [^115CYuaj] [^115mBpse]; EUS-guided blocks are used when percutaneous access is difficult [^114DK2GJ]. Local anesthetic with or without steroid is standard [^111XPo3E]; neurolysis or **radiofrequency ablation** is considered for durable relief [^116qY39H]. The procedure is generally safe [^113Hnfc7], with rare complications such as rectal perforation, infection, or transient bowel/bladder dysfunction [^114WKagF]; anticoagulation management follows low-risk interventional guidelines [^113DFbom]. Evidence supports short- to intermediate-term pain reduction [^113Hnfc7], with success rates of 70–90% in coccydynia and 60–75% in cancer-related perineal pain [^114dCKMR] [^115czqcg] [^113jthrW].

---

## Anatomy and physiology

The ganglion impar (Walther's ganglion) is a solitary sympathetic ganglion at the **sacrococcygeal junction** [^111xrAmb], anterior to the coccyx and posterior to the rectum [^114Wi3vn]. It receives **sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers** from the lumbosacral region and innervates the perineum, distal rectum, anus, distal urethra, vulva, scrotum, and distal vagina [^113H69fj]. It is the final relay for sympathetic outflow to the perineum and distal pelvic organs, modulating **nociceptive and sympathetic pain signals** [^115zPCcY].

---

## Indications

Ganglion impar block is indicated for chronic perineal and coccygeal pain syndromes, including:

- **Coccydynia**: Chronic coccygeal pain, often post-traumatic or idiopathic [^113Hnfc7] [^1122Q6Bc].
- **Perineal cancer pain**: Refractory pain from pelvic malignancies (e.g. rectal, anal, cervical, prostate) [^116uzLkW] [^113jthrW].
- **Sympathetic-mediated pelvic pain**: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the perineum, pudendal neuralgia, and other sympathetic pain syndromes [^1174MAWL] [^11381uuF].

---

## Contraindications

Contraindications include:

- **Absolute contraindications**: Infection at the injection site, severe coagulopathy, patient refusal, or inability to provide informed consent.
- **Relative contraindications**: Mild coagulopathy, anticoagulant use, pregnancy, and anatomical distortion due to prior surgery or congenital anomalies.

---

## Procedural techniques

Several techniques have been described, including:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Transsacrococcygeal approach | Needle advanced through the sacrococcygeal joint under fluoroscopy [^116Nb9vY] | Short needle path, direct access | Risk of discitis, difficult in fused joints [^115zPCcY] |
| Intercoccygeal approach | Needle advanced through the intercoccygeal joint [^113H69fj] | Alternative when sacrococcygeal joint is fused | Technical difficulty, risk of injury |
| Paracoccygeal approach | Needle advanced lateral to the coccyx [^1174MAWL] | Useful in anatomical variations | Risk of rectal perforation, infection |
| Ultrasound-guided approach | Real-time ultrasound guidance [^115CYuaj] | No radiation, visualizes soft tissues | Limited penetration, operator-dependent |
| CT-guided approach | CT guidance for needle placement [^115mBpse] | Precise anatomical localization | Radiation exposure, cost |
| EUS-guided approach | Endoscopic ultrasound guidance [^114DK2GJ] | Direct visualization, minimal invasion | Specialized equipment, expertise required |

---

## Medications used

Local anesthetics such as **bupivacaine 0.25–0.5% or ropivacaine 0.2–0.5%** provide diagnostic and short-term relief [^114ihMaX]. Corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 40 mg or triamcinolone 40 mg) may be added for **anti-inflammatory effect** and prolonged relief [^1116M7MG]. Neurolytic agents like **phenol 6–10% or alcohol 50–100%** are used for permanent or semi-permanent relief in cancer-related pain [^112ARFos].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

Ganglion impar block demonstrates favorable outcomes across indications:

- **Coccydynia**: 70–90% success, with median relief lasting 6–12 months [^114dCKMR].
- **Perineal cancer pain**: 60–75% success, with significant opioid-sparing effects [^113jthrW] [^112ARFos].
- **Sympathetic-mediated pain**: 50–70% success, particularly in CRPS and pudendal neuralgia [^notfound].

---

## Complications and risks

Complications are rare but include:

- **Rectal perforation**: Rare, preventable with careful technique and imaging guidance [^114WKagF].
- **Infection**: Rare, minimized by sterile technique and antibiotic prophylaxis.
- **Bleeding**: Rare, minimized by careful patient selection and anticoagulation management [^1176g3V2].
- **Transient bowel/bladder dysfunction**: Rare, typically self-limited [^114WKagF].

---

## Anticoagulation management

Ganglion impar block is categorized as a low-risk interventional procedure for bleeding [^113DFbom]. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are generally continued, with individualized risk assessment and INR monitoring when indicated [^1176g3V2].

---

## Comparison with other interventions

Compared with other interventions, **superior hypogastric plexus block** is more effective for upper pelvic pain, whereas ganglion impar block is superior for perineal pain [^113jthrW]. Coccygectomy is effective but carries higher complication rates and longer recovery than minimally invasive blocks [^notfound]. Neuromodulation is effective for chronic pelvic pain but is more invasive and costly than ganglion impar block [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on refining imaging guidance, optimizing injectate formulations, and expanding indications. Ongoing studies are evaluating **long-term efficacy**, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared with other interventions [^111UJjXD] [^117McGUG].

---

Ganglion impar block is a **safe and effective minimally invasive procedure** for chronic perineal and coccygeal pain, with high success rates and minimal complications. It is a valuable option for patients refractory to conservative therapy, particularly those with coccydynia or cancer-related perineal pain [^113Hnfc7] [^117PJydo].

### Non-neurodestructive ganglion impar blocks for coccydynia and related disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Hnfc7]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Importance

Chronic coccydynia is a challenging condition to manage. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the role of the ganglion impar in coccygeal nociception. When conservative treatments fail, minimally invasive interventions at the ganglion impar may be effective in providing relief.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ganglion impar blocks (GIBs) for the management of chronic coccydynia.

Evidence Review

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Relevant studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase Classic+ Embase, CINAHL and the Web of Science in February 2024. Data on patient characteristics, intervention details, pain outcomes (measured by Visual Analog Scale and Numerical Pain Rating Scale) and adverse events were extracted. Meta-analysis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) on scale of 0 to 10.

Findings

Seventeen studies described 625 coccydynia patients treated with GIB. All studies reported some level of improvement of pain after GIB. The meta-analysis included 11 studies totaling 391 patients with a baseline pain score of 7.93 (7.81 to 8.04 95%CI). GIBs were effective in reducing coccygeal pain at short-term (up to 3 months), intermediate-term (3–6 months) and long-term (greater than 6 months) follow-up. SMDs were -2.73 (95% CI -3.45 to -2.01), -2.13 (95% CI -2.82 to -1.45), -1.86 (95% CI -2.58 to -1.15) at 3 months, 3–6 months and > 6 months, respectively. No serious adverse events were noted. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment indicated 'very low' certainty of evidence across all outcomes.

Conclusions

Non-neurodestructive GIB may be a safe and potentially effective treatment option for patients with chronic, refractory coccydynia.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^113H69fj]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Ganglion Impar block (GIB)

The ganglion Impar (also known as the ganglion of Walther) is found on the ventral surface of the coccyx where it forms the caudal origin of the bilateral sympathetic chain. It can be found anterior to the sacrococcygeal joint, the coccyx, or to the tip of the coccyx. The ganglion is said to supply nociceptive and sympathetic fibers to the perineum, distal rectum, perianal region, distal urethra, vulva/scrotum, and the distal third of the vagina. It also supplies sympathetic innervation to the pelvic viscera.

GIB has first been described by Plancarte et al in 1990, initially to treat sympathetic pain of malignant origin. Since then, it has also been used to alleviate other, benign causes of intractable perineal pain and coccygodynia. The nature and extent of the innervation patterns of ganglion Impar are still not defined.

The first described approach to reach ganglion Impar was through anococcygeal ligament until the needle reaches the anterior of the sacrococcygeal joint. Next, the transsacrococcygeal approach was defined, since it required less expertise and provided a shorter needle path and a more direct approach. Other intercoccygeal joint approaches have also been described in the literature. In some patients, sacrococcygeal joint or intercoccygeal joints can be fused, preventing a direct approach. For those cases, paracoccygeal approaches are defined and can be used to reach the ganglion. Fluoroscopy is mainly used for imaging guidance (Figure 3Aa and B), but recently CT and ultrasonographic guidance has also been defined. A feasibility study of MR imaging guidance has also shown it to be accurate and safe.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^11381uuF]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The inputs from sympathetic ganglia have been known to be involved in the pathophysiology of various painful conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, cancer pain of different origin, and coccygodynia. Sympathetic ganglia blocks are used to relieve patients who suffer from these conditions for over a century. Many numbers of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine or neurolytic agents such as alcohol can be chosen for a successful block. The agent is selected according to its duration of effect and the purpose of the injection. Most commonly used sympathetic blocks are stellate ganglion block, lumbar sympathetic block, celiac plexus block, superior hypogastric block, and ganglion Impar block. In this review, indications, methods, effectiveness, and complications of these blocks are discussed based on the data from the current literature.

### Repeated ganglion impar block in a cohort of 83 patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain [^1174MAWL]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The ganglion impar is the first pelvic ganglion of the efferent sympathetic trunk that relays pelvic and perineal nociceptive messages and therefore constitutes a therapeutic target.

Objective

The objective of this single-center study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 repeated ganglion impar blocks in patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain on intention-to-treat.

Study Design

Retrospective single-center study.

Setting

We reviewed the medical records of 83 patients with chronic refractory pelvic and perineal pain. On intention-to-treat analysis, 62 (74.7%) of the patients received 3 ganglion impar blocks.

Methods

Ganglion impar block was performed with 0.75% ropivacaine via a lateral approach over the Co1-Co2 coccygeal joint with computed tomography (CT) guidance. The effectiveness of ganglion impar blocks was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 30 minutes after the blocks. Evaluation at least one month after the block was also performed by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C).

Results

A total of 220 blocks were performed, 193 (87.7%) of which were considered to be positive with immediate but transient improvement of pain by more than 50% and complete but transient pain relief after the procedure in 119 (54.1%) procedures. The variation of the VAS score before and after each block was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Similarly, the VAS score before repeated blocks was significantly improved with decreased pain intensity over time (P = 0.001). Analysis of the PGI-C one month after the block demonstrated improvement in 41% of cases in the overall population and in 43.6% of cases in the subgroup of 62 patients treated by 3 blocks.

Limitations

Retrospective study, short term follow-up.

Conclusions

Repeated ganglion impar blocks allowed short-term reduction of pain intensity with a moderate intermediate-term effect. Ganglion impar appears to be a useful therapeutic target to block the nociceptive message by acting on sensitization phenomena. Key words: Pudendal neuralgia, impar block, pain, perineal, coccygodynia.

Ganglion Impar Block

The ganglion impar or the ganglion of Walther is a solitary ganglion located on the anterior surface of the sacrum. It provides the nociceptive and sympathetic supply to the perineum, distal rectum, perianal region, distal urethra, vulva/scrotum, and the distal third of the vagina. The ganglion impar nerve block was first described by Plancarte et al in 1990, initially to treat sympathetic pain of malignant origin utilizing an anococcygeal approach under fluoroscopy. Since then, it has been largely used to treat many non-malignant forms of pain, especially intractable perineal pain and coccygodynia, but is also utilized in the management of intractable pain resulting from rectal, anal, vulvar or other perineal cancers.

Ganglion impar block or neurolysis is most commonly performed using a percutaneous transcoccygeal approach with fluoroscopic guidance as it provides a shorter needle path and a more direct approach. Other anatomical approaches have also been described such as intercoccygeal joint approaches and paracoccygeal approaches if the sacrococcygeal joint or intercoccygeal joints are fused or there is an impediment to a direct approach. It is most commonly performed with fluoroscopic guidance but has been described with CT, and ultrasound guidance.

### Lower EUS-guided ganglion impar blockade [^115zPCcY]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

The ganglion impar is the first pelvic ganglion of the efferent sympathetic trunk (Fig. 1). It innervates pelvic and perineal structures including the perineum, rectum, anus, coccyx, vagina, vulva, and urethra, from which it transmits nociceptive information. Levator ani syndrome, also termed chronic proctalgia, is characterized by relatively constant or frequent dull anorectal pain without an identifiable physical mechanism. It has a prevalence of 6.6%and most commonly occurs between 30 and 60 years of age. Although the pathophysiology remains unknown, pain may be associated with visceral hyperalgesia.

Figure 1
The ganglion impar is the terminal ganglion at the distal tip of the sympathetic trunk and innervates structures within the pelvis and perineum.

When the pain is refractory to conservative medical therapy, including neuromodulators, localized nerve injections may be offered. Traditionally, anesthesia pain clinics may perform this procedure through an anococcygeal approach using a bent needle, a lateral paramedian coccygeal approach under fluoroscopic guidance, or transdiscal through the sacroccygeal disc, typically using a combination of local anesthetic (bupivacaine or lidocaine), normal saline solution, and steroid (triamcinolone or methylprednisolone). Improvement in pain as determined through symptom surveys occurs in 41% to 100% of cases at 1 to 2 months; however, potential risks include bleeding, pain (particularly when using a bent needle or corkscrew approach), discitis, and injury to the surrounding pelvic organs. Furthermore, this approach may be limited in patients with obesity and those with sacrococcygeal disc fusion.

### Ultrasound-guided ganglion impar block: a technical report [^115CYuaj]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ganglion impar block is an uncommon procedure that has been performed traditional with fluoroscopy. One approach is the trans-sacrococcygeal approach. Sometimes this can be difficult because the sacrococcygeal joint (SCJ) cannot be readily seen on anteroposterior (AP) and lateral fluoroscopy. This technical report describes the feasibility of ultrasound in assisting ganglion impar blocks.

Methods

We performed ganglion impar block using ultrasound as the primary imaging tool, with fluoroscopic confirmation in 15 patients. We used a linear array transducer (5–12 MHz) to obtain sonographic transverse and longitudinal views at the sacral cornua; we identified the first cleft below the sacral hiatus as the SCJ. Then we inserted a 23-gauge (7 cm in length) needle into the SCJ under sonographic guidance. Then we confirmed proper needle depth by lateral fluoroscopy and injection of contrast agent.

Results

In all 15 procedures, we accurately located and passed the needle into the patients' SCJs under real time sonographic guidance.

Conclusions

In cases where the cleft cannot be readily seen on AP and lateral fluoroscopy, we have found ultrasound to be of assistance. Ultrasound does not replace fluoroscopy, because lateral fluoroscopy is still required to establish safe depth, and correct site of injection. However, ultrasound can be helpful when fluoroscopy alone is insufficient.

### Visceral nerve interventions in interventional radiology [^1159U24g]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic abdominal visceral pain management often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Image-guided visceral nerve interventions may be critical in the management of visceral pain refractory to medical treatments. Abdominal and pelvic pain is mediated by specific nerves involving specific ganglia. The well-defined location of these ganglia provides important targets for percutaneous image-guided interventions to alleviate chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the anatomy, indications, evidence, and technical and clinical considerations and complications for celiac plexus, superior hypogastric, inferior hypogastric, and ganglion impar block and neurolysis.

### Lower EUS-guided ganglion impar blockade [^114DK2GJ]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Chronic pelvic pain syndromes including chronic proctalgia can be treated with neural blockade at the level of the ganglion impar, which is routinely performed in anesthesia pain clinics. However, its location anterior to the bony sacrum makes a percutaneous approach challenging and poses difficulties in patients with obesity or a fused sacrococcygeal disc. In contrast, the EUS approach offers close proximity to the ganglion, which resides just posterior to the rectum. We demonstrate a technically feasible and safe approach to ganglion impar block. Further studies evaluating long-term efficacy and safety are required before the procedure can be adopted and disseminated.

### Transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar block for management of chronic perineal pain: a prospective observational study [^114Fhesp]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The ganglion impar or ganglion of Walther is a solitary retroperitoneal structure at the level of sacrococcygeal junction. It provides the nociceptive and sympathetic supply to the perineal structures. Chronic Perineal Pain (CPP) has been effectively managed by ganglion impar block. In this study we analyze the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of ganglion impar block by transsacrococcygeal approach.

Design

An observational report.

Methods

In this prospective study, 16 consecutive patients who required ganglion impar block for CPP were followed for two months. After informed and written consent, the ganglion impar was blocked under aseptic precautions, using a transsacrococcygeal approach. The Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS) at presentation time required for the pain to reduce by 50% to be considered effective and VAS was recorded at different time points during 2-month follow-up, and time required to perform the procedure, number of attempts, and any complications were also noted.

Results

All the blocks were effective with a mean duration of 12 ± 3 minutes for 50% reduction in VAS. The mean duration required to perform the procedure in neurolytic block patients was 7.8 ± 2 minutes and 5.7 ± 1 minutes in therapeutic block patients. There were no adverse events. All the patients had significant pain relief during 2 month follow-up (p < 0.05 compared to baseline). The mean VAS at 2 months was about 2. Statistical analysis was done by using paired "t"/Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Conclusion

A transsacrococcygeal approach for a ganglion impar block is a technically feasible and safe technique. We recommend this technique for neurolysis or radiofrequency ablation of the ganglion impar and for diagnostic blocks, especially when the diagnosis and further plan of management is dependent on the response of the diagnostic block.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) best practices and guidelines for the interventional management of cancer-associated pain [^113jthrW]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Data regarding the efficacy of neurolytic ganglion impar block in a purely oncologic population is limited to case reports and case series; however, these have consistently shown improved pain with no significant adverse effects. Plancarte et al reported on 16 patients with advanced malignancies and significant pelvic pain, and found a 60% improvement in pain symptoms following neurolytic ganglion impar block. In 2008, Eker et al described a pain improvement of greater than 60% after completion of ganglion impar block in three patients diagnosed with malignant rectal neoplasia and perineal pain. Another study published in 2012 described six patients with pelvic or gastrointestinal carcinomas of advanced stages, whom obtained significant pain relief following ganglion impar block, which was sustained at 2 months.

In addition, studies with mixed non-oncologic and oncologic populations undergoing ganglion impar neurolysis or block have reported good outcomes. Toshniwal et al conducted a prospective observational study, which included 16 patients with mixed chronic perineal pain of both malignant and benign origin. Patients underwent the trans-sacrococcygeal approach under fluoroscopic guidance, and achieved pain reductions of greater than 50% at the two-month follow-up period. In 2009, Agarwal-Kozlowski et al demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of pelvic pain in a retrospective review of 43 patients with mixed malignant and non-malignant refractory pelvic and perineal pain who underwent CT guided ganglion impar neurolysis. The authors reported a 75% decrease in VAS at 4-month follow-up.

The complications of ganglion impar nerve block or neurolysis are infrequent, and include motor, sexual, bladder, bowel dysfunction, and perforation of the rectum. Ganglion impar nerve blocks and neurolysis, while lacking RCTs in perineal oncologic pain, has been shown to be effective and safe in helping with these pain conditions.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^114Wi3vn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coccydynia is defined as pain in the sacrococcygeal region. It is a disorder that not only reduces a patient's quality of life, but it is difficult to treat. Numerous physiological and psychological causes can contribute to its etiology. Typically, it is related to chronic inflammation triggered by abnormal mobilization of the coccygeal structures. Childbirth as well as minor but repetitive and direct trauma are considered as possible causal factors. Coccydynia is rarely related to neoplasms or psychological conditions such as somatization. Its incidence is unknown, but female gender and obesity increase the risk.

Patients with coccydynia typically complain of pain in the coccyx. This pain increases with prolonged sitting, leaning backwards during sitting, prolonged standing and standing up after being in a sitting position. Conservative treatments such as non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), levator ani relaxation exercises, sitting cushions and transcutaneous electrical simulation have all been used to alleviate the pain, however these methods are ineffective in 10% of patients.

The impar ganglion, also known as the Walther ganglion, is the terminal pelvic division of the sympathetic chain and is located behind the rectum, anterior to the sacrococcygeal joint and coccyx. It provides nociceptive and sympathetic innervation to the perineum. When conservative treatments fail to alleviate pain in patients with coccydynia, the impar ganglion can be blocked through the sacrococcygeal or the intercoccygeal junction with the help of screening techniques. After insertion and confirmation of the needle position, local anesthetic drugs, either with or without steroids are injected and thermal ablation via radiofrequency may be applied. However there is limited clinical evidence to support the efficacy of these interventions.

The aim of our study was to evaluate pain scores in patients with coccydynia who underwent an impar ganglion block in our algology department due to the failure of conservative treatment over the course of a 1-year follow-up period.

### Pain relief due to transsacrococcygeal ganglion impar block in chronic coccygodynia: a pilot study [^114dCKMR]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Coccygodynia is a distressing condition that presents with pain around the coccyx. Impar (Walther) ganglion is a sympathetic ganglion located at the end of lumbosacral sympathetic chain. The objective of this study is to share our results and follow up of 34 ganglion impar blocks in 22 patients.

Design

Retrospective pilot study.

Setting

Interventional Pain Clinic in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in a university hospital.

Subjects

Twenty-two patients with coccygodynia who did not respond to conservative treatment and then presented to interventional pain clinic of a PM&R department in a university hospital

Methods

Pain was evaluated via 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). VAS values were obtained before, 1 hour and 3 weeks after injection and during this study was conducted.

Results

For achieving at least 50% relief of pain, the success rate of a first injection was 82%, but accounted for three technical failures. In patients with a successful outcome, relief lasted for a median duration of 6 months. Relief was reinstated for a median period of 17 months by a second injection in nine patients who presented for repeat treatment. No relief was achieved in two of these patients when they presented for a third treatment.

Conclusions

Ganglion impar block appears to be effective in patients who have coccygodynia resistant to conservative therapy, with high success rates and prolonged duration of effect. Controlled studies are required to reveal the mechanism of this effect.

### Interventional management for pelvic pain [^1139qRkB]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Interventional procedures can be applied for diagnostic evaluation and treatment of the patient with pelvic pain, often once more conservative measures have failed to provide relief. This article reviews interventional management strategies for pelvic pain. We review superior and inferior hypogastric plexus blocks, ganglion impar blocks, transversus abdominis plane blocks, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and genitofemoral blocks, pudendal nerve blocks, and selective nerve root blocks. Additionally, we discuss trigger point injections, sacroiliac joint injections, and neuromodulation approaches.

### Conventional radiofrequency thermocoagulation vs pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation of ganglion impar in chronic perineal pain of nononcological origin [^11232puT]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic nononcological perineal pain has been effectively managed by ganglion Impar block. Chemical neurolysis, cryoablation, and radiofrequency ablation have been the accepted methods of blockade. Recently, pulsed radiofrequency, a novel variant of conventional radiofrequency, has been used for this purpose.

Study Design

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

Two different interventional pain management centers in India.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of conventional radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency for gangliom Impar block.

Methods

The patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the conventional radiofrequency (CRF) group (N = 34), conventional radiofrequency ablation was done, and in the PRF pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) group (N = 31), pulsed radiofrequency ablation was done. After informed and written consent, fluoroscopy-guided ganglion Impar block was performed through the first intracoccygeal approach. The extent of pain relief was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) at 24hours, and at the first, third, and sixth weeks following the intervention. A questionnaire to evaluate subjective patient satisfaction was also used at each follow-up visit.

Results

In the CRF group, the mean VAS score decreased significantly from the baseline value at each follow-up visit. But in the PRF group, this decrease was insignificant except at 24-hour follow-up. Intergroup comparison also showed significantly better pain relief in the CRF group as compared with the PRF group. At the end of follow-up, 28 patients (82%) in the CRF group and four patients (13%) in the PRF group had excellent results, as assessed by the subjective patient satisfaction questionnaire. There was no complication in any patient of either study group, except for short-lived infection at the site of skin puncture in a few.

Conclusion

Ganglion Impar block by conventional radiofrequency provided a significantly better quality of pain relief with no major side effects in patients with chronic nononcological perineal pain as compared with pulsed radiofrequency.

Limitations

The short-term follow-up period of only six weeks was a major drawback associated with this study.

### The use of interventional procedures for cancer pain. A brief review [^113L6qkH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Nerve plexus/sympathetic blocks

Interruption of afferent or sympathetic nerve pathways forms the basis for analgesia in relevant body parts. Visceral afferent nociception from cancer involving upper abdominal structures such as the pancreas, liver, stomach, adrenals and kidneys travels through the celiac plexus and then through the splanchnic nerves to the central nervous system.

For lower abdominal and pelvic structures such as the bladder, prostate, sigmoid colon, uterus, ovaries, vaginal fundus, and rectum, the afferent nociceptive signals pass through the superior hypogastric plexus. For perineal structures such as the anus, distal rectum, urethra, scrotum, vulva, and vagina, afferent signals pass through the ganglion impar (ganglion of Walther) located on the anterior surface of the sacrum at the sacrococcygeal junction.

Among cancer pain interventions, celiac plexus block and neurolysis have been most heavily studied, and their use has been largely supported by randomized controlled trials and systematic review for analgesic efficacy. Most of the evidence, however, draws on the early studies using a percutaneous fluoroscopy guided approach. Later studies demonstrated non-inferiority from ultrasound-guided modality. Advancing techniques has seen the increasing utilization of CT guided approach to provide three-dimensional visualization of needle placement (Figs. 2 and 3). These advances necessitate the involvement of an interventional radiologist in the interdisciplinary team.

Other sympathetic blocks that can be performed include stellate ganglion blocks for managing pain in the head and neck, breast, and upper limb region and also lumbar sympathetic blocks for sympathetically maintained lower limb pain. Similarly, randomized controlled studies that assess these are lacking in the literature. Splanic nerve block with fluoroscopy/X-ray guidance is shown in Fig. 4.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^112SZq8R]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A 1-year follow-up of coccydynia patients demonstrated that the impar ganglion block procedure effectively controlled pain and that a DB + pulse RFT further prolonged analgesic efficacy. Coccydynia is a symptom with different causal factors including twisting of the sacrococcygeal joint or intercoccygeal segment, fracture, infection, tumor or degenerative changes. These factors can lead to localized pain at the coccygeal site, which increases while in a seated position. Pain is the diagnostic symptom, especially in the coccyx and sacrococcygeal areas, as demonstrated during physical examination and through radiologic screening. Conservative treatments include oral analgesic drugs, use of a sitting cushion, physiotherapy, massage, psychotherapy and manipulation. An impar ganglion block is an option when conservative treatment is insufficient; therefore, in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the impar ganglion block in patients who did not benefit from conservative treatment.

The impar ganglion is the terminal division of the sympathetic chain located in the midline and, in contrast to other divisions, is the only solitary autonomic division. The definitive anatomic location of the impar ganglion remains uncertain but is considered to be anterior to the sacrococcygeal joint, coccyx or distal end of the coccyx. Different approaches to accessing the ganglion using screening techniques such as fluoroscopy, ultrasonography and computerized tomography to view the tip of the needle during the procedure have been described in the literature. The sacrococcygeal joint is closed in 51% of patients, which makes access from the intercoccygeal area easier for the physician. The blocks in this study were performed using transsacrococcygeal and intersacrococcygeal approaches with the assistance of fluoroscopy.

Coccydynia occurs more frequently in females. While it can occur at any age, the incidence increases in people over forty. Consistent with the literature, 66% of our patients were female and the average age was 53.45 ± 9.6. A high BMI is also a known risk factor for coccydynia, and, in our study, the average patient had a BMI of 29.55 ± 4.21, which is close to the obesity cut-off value. We observed a tendency of patients to be overweight and obese, but there was no association between the BMI and patient's VAS scores.

### Successful treatment of radiation-induced proctitis pain by blockade of the ganglion impar in an elderly patient with prostate cancer: a case report [^112rPM53]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic rectal pain secondary to radiation-induced proctitis is fast-becoming a leading cause of chronic pain, especially for prostate cancer survivors. Currently, many elderly patients resort to increased opioid intake to alleviate the pain. However, this increase in opioid consumption often leads to constipation and further aggravates the anorectal pain, thus leading to a perpetual, vicious cycle. We reasoned that blocking the ganglion impar could attenuate this sympathetically maintained pain, which would lead to a reduction in the consumption of opioids, lessen constipation, and lead to an improvement in the patient's quality of life.

Study Design

Case report.

Setting

An academic tertiary pain management clinic.

Results

The authors report the case of a 73-year-old African American man with a history of prostate cancer who presented to the pain management clinic for evaluation and treatment of his chronic anorectal pain secondary to radiation-induced proctitis. The patient underwent a ganglion impar block, using the transcoccygeal technique, and consequently reported excellent pain relief with little or no use for opioid pain medications at a 2-month follow-up. Ultimately, this approach led to improved mobility and an increase in the patient's quality of life.

Conclusions

Based on this case's success, a prospective study or randomized control trial evaluating the efficacy of the ganglion impar block as a treatment option for chronic anorectal pain secondary to radiation-induced proctitis appears warranted.

### Lower EUS-guided ganglion impar blockade [^114ADyKY]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Neurolysis through an EUS approach has long been demonstrated as technically safe and efficacious, most notably in the setting of celiac plexus block to treat pain associated with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancy. However, ganglion impar blockade has not previously been demonstrated. Given the proximity between the ganglion impar and posterior rectum (Fig. 2), we propose a lower EUS approach to ganglion impar blockade for pelvic pain syndromes (Video 1, available online at).

Figure 2
Lower endoscopic ultrasound approach. A, The ganglion impar is the terminal ganglion at the distal tip of the sympathetic trunk. B, A linear echoendoscope is positioned facing the posterior rectum to visualize sacrococcygeal landmarks used to identify the location of the ganglion impar.

This video case presentation highlights a 62-year-old man who presented with a 10-year history of rectal pain. Perianal and digital rectal examination revealed no abnormalities, and flexible sigmoidoscopy was unremarkable. His pain worsened with prolonged sitting and was refractory to topical therapy with sitz baths, steroids, anesthetics, calcium channel blockade, and nitrates. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the spine demonstrated degenerative disease between L4 and S3, but no nerve compression. Because of chronic proctalgia (levator ani syndrome) and unfeasibility of a percutaneous approach owing to intervertebral degenerative disc disease and sacral fusion, he was referred for lower EUS with ganglion impar block under fluoroscopic guidance.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^1124umxW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to evaluate pain scores one year after impar ganglion block in patients with coccydynia who did not benefit from conservative treatment.

Methods

The medical records of 29 patients with coccydynia were reviewed. Patients who were referred to the algology clinic and underwent impar ganglion blocks were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic data, time to the onset of pain, causes of pain, X-ray findings, administered invasive procedures, and visual analog scale (pain) scores were recorded.

Results

A total of 29 patients were included in the study, 10 males (34%) and 19 females (66%). The average age and body mass index were 53.45 ± 9.6 and 29.55 ± 4.21 respectively. In 21 patients, the onset of pain was associated with trauma. Nineteen patients (65.5%) had anterior coccygeal angulation. The average visual analog scale score before undergoing an impar ganglion block was 7.4 ± 1. After the procedure, the scores at < 3 months, 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year follow-up intervals were significantly lower (p < 0.05). Furthermore, visual analog scale scores at the 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year periods were significantly lower in patients who received diagnostic blocks plus pulse radiofrequency thermocoagulation than in patients who underwent a diagnostic block only.

Conclusions

The impar ganglion block provides effective analgesia without complications in patients with coccydynia. Pulse radiofrequency thermocoagulation combined with a diagnostic block prolongs the analgesic effect of the procedure.

### Superior hypogastric plexus combined with ganglion impar neurolytic blocks for pelvic and / or perineal cancer pain relief [^112ARFos]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The superior hypogastric plexus (SHGP) carries afferents from the viscera of the lower abdomen and pelvis. Neurolytic block of this plexus is used for reducing pain resulting from malignancy in these organs. The ganglion impar (GI) innervats the perineum, distal rectum, anus, distal urethra, vulva, and distal third of the vagina. Different approaches to the ganglion impar neurolysis have been described in the literature.

Objectives

To assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of combining the block of the SHGP through the postero-median transdiscal approach with the GI block by the trans-sacro-coccygeal approach for relief of pelvic and/or perineal pain caused by pelvic and/or perineal malignancies or any cancer related causes.

Methods

Fifteen patients who had cancer-related pelvic pain, perineal pain, or both received a combined SHGP neurolytic block through the postero-median transdiscal approach using a 20-gauge Chiba needle and injection of 10 mL of 10% phenol in saline plus a GI neurolytic block by the trans-sacro-coccygeal approach using a 22-gauge 5 cm needle and injection of 4–6 mL of 8% phenol in saline. Pain intensity (measured using a visual analogue scale) and oral morphine consumption pre- and post-procedure were measured.

Results

All patients presented with cancer-related pelvic, perineal, or pelviperineal pain. Pain scores were reduced from a mean (± SD) of 7.87 ± 1.19 pre-procedurally to 2.40 ± 2.10 one week post-procedurally (P < 0.05). In addition, the mean consumption of morphine (delivered via 30 mg sustained-release morphine tablets) was reduced from 98.00 ± 34.89 mg to 32.00 ± 28.48 mg after one week (P < 0.05). No complications or serious side effects were encountered during or after the block.

Limitations

This study is limited by its small sample size and non-randomized study.

Conclusion

A combined neurolytic SHGP block with GI block is an effective and safe technique for reducing pain in cancer patients presented with pelvic and/or perineal pain. Also, a combined SHGP block through a posteromedian transdiscal approach with a GI block through a trans-sacrococcygeal approach may be considered more effective and easier to perform than the recently invented bilateral inferior hypogastric plexus neurolysis through a transsacral approach.

### Ultrasonography reinvents the originally described technique for ganglion impar neurolysis in perianal cancer pain [^111TkRa4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Visceral pain in the perineal area associated with malignancies may be effectively treated with neurolysis of the ganglion impar. Since the first description of the technique of accessing the ganglion impar through anococcygeal ligament, many techniques for ganglion impar block have been described. We present a patient diagnosed with carcinoma of the anal canal who was successfully given ultrasound-guided ganglion impar block using a Chiba needle inserted through the anococcygeal ligament. In summary, ultrasound-guided ganglion impar neurolysis is a fast, safe, and cost-effective method, which can be used as a first-line pain relief intervention for good quality of life in patients with perianal cancers.

### Predictive factors affecting treatment success in ganglion impar block applied in chronic coccygodynia [^115jNaNT]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to determine the predictive factors affecting the success of ganglion impar block applied in chronic coccygodynia.

Methods

Patients who received ganglion impar block to treat coccygodynia between January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2021 were retrospectively screened. Of the 195 patients, 102 met the final analysis criteria and were included in the study. Demographic data, coccygodynia etiology, coccygodynia symptom duration, history of coccyx fracture, regular opioid use, and presence of other musculoskeletal chronic pain conditions accompanying coccygodynia were obtained from patient records. In addition, coccyx radiography was examined, and coccyx curvature type, permanent subluxation, and posterior spicule presence were evaluated. The criterion for treatment success was set as ≥ 50% reduction in Numerical Rating Scale pain scores in the third month after treatment.

Results

Treatment was successful of the patients in 69.6% (95% CI 60.4% to 78.7%). A significant cut-off value (24.5 months) was determined for coccygodynia symptom duration using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Symptom duration above the cut-off value was defined as prolonged symptom duration. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive factors affecting treatment success in the third month after injection. In the final model, the presence of permanent subluxation (yes vs no), and the prolonged symptom duration (yes vs no) were found to have significant effects on treatment success (OR 9.56, 95% CI 1.44 to 63.40, p = 0.02; OR 137.00, 95% CI 19.59 to 958.03, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Treatment success of ganglion impar block for coccygodynia is high. However, longer preprocedure symptom duration and the presence of permanent subluxation were associated with a decrease likelihood of treatment success.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^1116ktZj]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blocks applied to cancer‐related pain include paravertebral; erector spinae plane; brachial plexus; nerves in the head and neck; and intercostal nerves. The evidence for their use in acute cancer‐related pain is, however, limited to single cases and smaller series which illustrate some benefit. Local anaesthetics are used most commonly for these blocks but due to their short duration of action may be given as intermittent boluses or continuously using a catheter, with or without adjuvants such as adrenaline and clonidine. Neurolytic drugs have also been used in some documented cases but are rarely implemented in those patients with a good prognosis as resulting neuritis can cause more problematic symptoms than the original pain.

Sympathetic nerve blocks are useful as visceral afferent nociception is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system which can be readily interrupted, providing analgesia. Coeliac plexus and splanchnic neurolytic blocks with ethanol/alcohol may be considered for upper abdominal cancers such as pancreas, stomach and liver, especially in those patients with short life expectancy. However, results have been mixed especially where tumours are more advanced, with distortion of local surrounding anatomy leading to variable spread of neurolytic drugs. For lower abdominal and pelvic structures such as the bladder, prostate, sigmoid colon and rectum, the afferent nociceptive signals pass through the superior hypogastric plexus which can be blocked. Ganglion of impar blocks are most suitable for perineal structures. Sympathetic nerve blocks are performed routinely under imaging and contrast guidance, traditionally X‐ray, but now many are performed under computed tomography guidance, leading to improved accuracy.

### Transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar: radiofrequency application for the treatment of chronic intractable coccydynia [^112Xgzvy]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

A ganglion impar block can be used to treat acute or chronic perineal pain. Various methods exist to block the ganglion impar, such as local anesthetics, concomitant use of local anesthetics and steroids, alcohol or phenol, and neurolysis by RFT.

We performed a block of the ganglion impar using RFT, which is a percutaneous minimally invasive procedure. Because of its widespread use and availability, we consider it as a good option for the safe destruction of the ganglion impar.

The effectiveness of the treatment in patients with chronic coccydynia corresponded with a change in the VAS score.–This condition affects females five times more than males. The most common cause of coccydynia is trauma as a result of falling on the buttocks. In a similar manner, our patients were mostly females and had a trauma history. We measured the treatment effectiveness by evaluating the changes in the VAS scores.

Patt and Plancartefirst described a technique to block the ganglion impar. This conventional transanococcygeal membrane method is technically difficult, involves the risk of injuring the rectum and blood vessels, and has a high degree (~20%–30%) of failure. In addition, rectal perforation can cause contamination of the needle and increase the risk of needle stick injury to the surgeon's finger in the rectum. The transsacrococcygeal approach to the ganglion, described by Wemm and Saberski, is technically feasible and easy to learn and perform. Furthermore, Reig et al demonstrated that the transsacrococcygeal approach is technically feasible for RFT of the ganglion impar.

We recommend using the transsacrococcygeal technique in our patients for RFT of the ganglion impar. Larger studies with randomized control groups would improve the level of evidence supporting the findings in this retrospective observational study.

### CT-guided injection for ganglion impar blockade: a radiological approach to the management of coccydynia [^115mBpse]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT) in needle placement for ganglion impar blocks, and to determine the efficacy of CT-guided ganglion impar blocks in the management of coccydynia.

Materials and Methods

The results of ganglion impar blockade in eight patients with coccydynia secondary to trauma or unknown cause were reviewed. The diagnosis of coccydynia was based on clinical history, location of pain, and response to previous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The eight patients were treated with CT-guided ganglion impar blocks to manage their coccyx pain after conservative procedures, including oral medication and cushions, failed to provide relief. All patients were subjected to ganglion impar blocks under a thin-section CT-guided technique for needle placement, using a mixture of bupivacaine and triamcinolone. The patients were followed-up for a period of 6-months.

Results

Eight patients were treated in this study with a total of 11 injections. A technical success of 100% was achieved in all cases with accurate needle placement without any complications and all the patients tolerated the procedure well. Out of eight, three patients (37%) had complete relief of pain on the follow-up intervals up to 6 months. Three out of eight patients (37%), had partial relief of symptoms and a second repeat injection was given at the 3 month interval of the follow-up period. At the end of the 6-month follow-up period, six out of eight patients (75%) experienced symptomatic relief (four complete relief and two partial relief) without any additional resort to conventional pain management. Twenty-five percent (two out of eight) did not have any symptomatic improvement. The mean visual analogue score (VAS) pre-procedure was 8 (range 6–10) and had decreased to 2 (range 0–5) in six out of eight patients.

Conclusion

CT can be used as an imaging method to identify the ganglion and guide the needle in ganglion impar blockade. The advantages of CT-guided injection over those performed under fluoroscopy may include accurate and confident needle placement in the sacro-coccygeal region, ease of wide area coverage, lesser risk of complications due to inadvertent injections into the major pelvic structures, and increased likelihood of reaching the ganglion impar, especially in cases with anatomical variation in the ganglion impar location. These factors may have implications in the overall success rate of ganglion impar blockade.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^115NJsb4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Radiofrequency treatment is a percutaneous and minimally invasive procedure that can be used in coccydynia patients who do not benefit from appropriate medical treatment and physiotherapy. It is more selective compared to phenol and alcohol neurolysis and leads to fewer complications. Reig et al. reported impar ganglion blocks with RFT as useful for non-malignant perineal pain. Similarly, Kırcelli et al. observed a significant decrease in pain scores, without complications, after impar ganglion block with RFT in patients with chronic coccydynia, except in 2 patients for whom the decrease in pain scores after RFT was no more than 50%. In our study, 4 patients (3 in the DB and 1 in the DB+ pulse RFT group) did not benefit from treatment and were referred to coccyx-excision surgery.

Serious complications such as rectal perforation, hemorrhage and infection, along with difficulties in implementing the technique, restrict the popularity of this highly effective block. In all of our patients, the blocks were performed after both the needle tip and the spread of the radiocontrast substance was confirmed at the relevant area under fluoroscopy. No complications occurred during or after the procedure.

Surgical excision of the coccyx for the treatment of coccydynia is the option of last resort and is performed only if all other treatments have failed. High complication rates and failure to relieve pain have been reported with this procedure, but its overall success rate is between 51 and 90%. In 4 of our patients who underwent surgical coccyx excision due to insufficient pain relief with conservative and interventional treatments, their VAS scores decreased to ≤ 2 following surgery in 2 patients but remained between 5 and 6 in the other 2.

Limitations to our study include its relatively small sample size and the retrospective nature of the review. The impar ganglion block provides effective pain relief without complications in patients with coccydynia. Diagnostic blocks combined with pulse RFT achieved prolonged analgesic efficacy. However, prospective randomized studies involving larger sample sizes are needed to reach more conclusive results regarding the effectiveness of these procedures.

### Conventional versus high-voltage, long-term pulse radiofrequency of ganglion impar in perineal pain with advanced rectal cancer: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial [^117YMvCg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a prevalent symptom among patients with advanced diseases, with approximately 59% of patients undergoing cancer treatment, 64% of patients with advanced disease, and 33% of patients receiving curative treatment reporting pain. In addition, 10–20% of cancer patients may experience refractory cancer pain. Pain associated with advanced rectal cancer typically manifests in the perineum, abdomen, and lower back, with perineal pain being particularly pronounced. This discomfort significantly impacts the quality of life of patients.

The ganglion impar is located anterior to the articulation of the sacrum and coccyx, and it is innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers originating from the lumbosacral region. It modulates the transmission of signals related to nociceptive pain and sympathetic nerve pain in the perineum. The ganglion impar block (GIB), also known as Walters' block, is an easy and efficacious technique for targeting pelvic and perineal nociceptive pathways, GIB has demonstrated good efficacy in managing perineal pain. The clinical application of GIB has been extended to include drug blocking, chemical damage, and radiofrequency therapy. Accumulating evidence indicates that Ganglion Impar Radiofrequency (RF) can alleviate cancer-related and non-cancer-related pain.

There are two modes of radiofrequency: conventional radiofrequency (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF). CRF is safe and effective in treating sympathetic ganglia, whereas PRF exhibits limited therapeutic efficacy. Following the application of the ganglion impar high-voltage long-term pulsed radiofrequency (H-PRF) regimen, the remission rate of pudendal neuralgia remained high at 88.6% even after 3 months, making it a promising strategy for the treatment of cancerous perineal pain. Nevertheless, few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of CRF versus H-PRF in the management of cancer-related perineal pain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CRF and H-PRF of the ganglion impar in the management of perineal pain associated with advanced rectal cancer.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^114ihMaX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The medical records of 29 coccydynia patients treated with impar ganglion block at the algology department of Balikesir University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Age, gender, height, body weight, the onset of pain and its possible causes (falls, accidents, cancer, or idiopathic) were collected from medical records. X-ray images of the coccyx were examined to evaluate coccygeal structure and underlying physiology and potential pathologies. The images were classified as either normal or exhibiting anterior coccygeal angulation. Our study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (decision No: 2018/156).

The number of impar ganglion blocks used on patients, the 0.25% bupivacaine+ 40 mg methylprednisolone mixture used, and the application of radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFT) were recorded. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were acquired from the records both before and after the procedures. The VAS scores were obtained during policlinic check-ups and phone calls at < 3 months, 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year time intervals following the procedure. Patients who were referred to surgery after the procedure were also recorded, along with their VAS scores.

The impar ganglion block was performed using a 22-gauge needle from the midline. The tip of the needle and the spread of the radiopaque substance in front of the coccyx were observed using fluoroscopic lateral images with C-arm fluoroscopy assistance (Fig. 1). Blocks performed total 10 mL volume with 0.25% bupivacaine+ 40 mg methylprednisolone were classified as a diagnostic impar block (DB). After the DBs were performed, patients who subsequently underwent pulse RFT (NeuroTherm NT 1100, USA) at 42 °C for 2 min with a 22-G insulated RFT needle with a 5 mm active tip were classified as DB + RFT.

### Transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar: radiofrequency application for the treatment of chronic intractable coccydynia [^116Nb9vY]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Forty-one consecutive patients with chronic intractable perianal pain of various etiologies, who were treated with ganglion impar RFT, were included in our study. Fifty patients who were candidates for RFT first underwent a temporary ganglion impar block with 2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. RFT was offered to patients who had at least 50% reduction in pain according to their VAS score after local anesthesia. Nine patients who did not experience at least 50% reduction in pain according to their VAS score after local anesthesia were excluded. A transsacrococcygeal approach was used for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

In our pain treatment center, we routinely obtain written informed consent from all our patients before starting the procedure in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and record pre- and postprocedure VAS scores. This protocol was reviewed and approved by the Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Education and Research Hospital of Medicine Institutional Review Board and the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) protocol committee (Ünsal A), and patient consent was obtained from all patients for publishing this study.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the C-arm fluoroscopy table, with a cushion placed beneath the lower abdomen. After cleaning with an aseptic solution, a needle entry location was confirmed using fluoroscopy in an anterolateral position. Then, under the guidance of fluoroscopy in the lateral position, the needle was advanced to the sacrococcygeal disk. After passing to the disk, 1 mL of radiopaque dye was injected to verify the retroperitoneal field. We observed a "reverse comma" image when laterally viewed (Figure 1). After confirming the location of the needle tip, 2 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine was injected. The VAS scores were noted at 30 minutes after the block, and RFT was planned if the patient's pain reduction was at least 50%.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^116qY39H]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Especially before the 2000s, the literature about GIBs mainly composed of description of various techniques and case reports. There are several recent patient series that evaluate the effectiveness, and there is a certain lack of randomized controlled trials. Reig et al reported one of the first patient series in 2005. Their study included 13 patients with chronic perineal, non-cancer-related pain who underwent a fluoroscopy-guided, two-needle thermocoagulation of the ganglion Impar. The patients were followed for a maximum of six months. After therapy, the pain scores decreased by an average of 50% in the whole group. In 2007, Toshniwal et al reported their results of a prospective observational study, which included 16 patients with chronic perineal pain of both malignant and benign origin. They applied the transsacrococcygeal approach under fluoroscopic guidance and achieved a significant pain reduction during the two-month follow-up period. Agarwal-Kozlowski et al have reported their results of CT-guided lateral approach in 43 patients with perineal pain of both malignant and benign origins. They performed a total of 76 blocks, 48 of them being diagnostic blocks and 28 neuroablations. Nineteen patients had sufficient pain relief with LA injection only and did not require neuroablation, while 24 patients required neuroablation. Pain reduction was significant both at the time of discharge and after four months of follow-up period. Datir and Connell have reported their results of a series of eight patients who underwent CT-guided GIB. Three patients had complete relief of pain during the follow-up intervals up to six months. Three patients had partial relief of symptoms, and a second repeat injection was given at the three-month interval of the follow-up period. At the end of the six-month follow-up period, six out of eight patients experienced symptomatic relief. Demircay et al have reported the results of their retrospective analysis of 10 patients with coccygodynia, who underwent radiofrequency ablation of the ganglion Impar. Six months after the procedure, nine patients considered having a successful outcome. A similar retrospective analysis of 20 patients with chronic coccygodynia that does not respond to medical treatment, who received radiofrequency ablation, has shown that the procedure was successful in 75% of the patients in their 12 months of follow-up period. In 2015, Gunduz et al reported their results in a series of 22 patients with coccygodynia, who underwent a total of 34 injections of LAs and corticosteroids to ganglion Impar with a fluoroscopy-guided transsacrococcygeal approach. For achieving at least 50% relief of pain, the success rate of a first injection was 82% but accounted for three technical failures. In patients with a successful outcome, relief lasted for a median duration of six months. Relief was reinstated for a median period of 17 months by a second injection in nine patients who presented for repeat treatment. No relief was achieved in two of these patients when they presented for a third injection. Adas et al have most recently shown the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of ganglion Impar in a series of 41 patients with coccygodynia. The examinations carried out in the sixth month of the treatment showed that 37 patients had a successful outcome, whereas treatment failed in four of the patients.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^115t1rGm]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Stellate ganglion block (SGB)

Stellate ganglion, also known as the cervicothoracic ganglion, is part of the cervical sympathetic chain, formed by the fusion of inferior cervical ganglion with the first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. It is located as follows: medial to the scalene muscles; lateral to the longus colli muscle, esophagus, and trachea, along with the recurrent laryngeal nerve in between; anterior to the transverse processes; superior to the subclavian artery and the posterior aspect of the pleura; and posterior to the vertebral vessels at the C7 level. Stellate ganglion provides sympathetic input to the ipsilateral upper extremity, chest, face, and head.

Traditionally, SGB can be applied without any imaging, by palpating the anterior transverse process of C6, or the Chassaignac tubercle, and injecting the local anesthetic (LA) immediately medially. As the imaging techniques improved in the last century, SGBs have started to be done with imaging guidance (Figure 1A and B). Since the 1980s, computed tomography (CT) is being used. In the middle of 1990s, ultrasound (US) guidance has also become widely preferable. Many numbers of LAs (e.g. bupivacaine) and neurolytic agents (e.g. alcohol) can be chosen for block according to their duration of effect and the purpose of the injection. A block is considered successful by the development of Horner's syndrome, increase in skin temperature, increase in blood flow, and loss of the galvanic skin response.

### Lower EUS-guided ganglion impar blockade [^114pm5Mk]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to exclude abnormalities within the rectum or anal canal. Subsequently, lower EUS was prepared to identify the sacrum echoendosonographically, using color Doppler to evaluate for intervening vascular structures (Fig. 3). If present, an alternative approach would be considered. Positioning was confirmed with fluoroscopy with the patient in the left lateral position.

Figure 3
Ultrasound landmarks to identify ganglion impar location. Echoendosonographic visualization of the sacrum is performed to identify the location of the sacrococcygeal junction. Anterior (superficial) to the coccyx lies the presacral space where the ganglion impar resides.

The ganglion impar is located anterior to the sacrococcygeal disc (Figs. 4 and 5), which represents the target for injection, and lies 2 to 3 cm deep to the EUS probe. Intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were administered, and a 22-gauge needle (the same used for celiac plexus blockade) was advanced to the area of the ganglion impar with gentle aspiration to identify accidental entry into a blood vessel. A total of 15 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and 4 mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL) were injected for the ganglion impar block (Fig. 6). A total of 5 mL of nondiluted contrast was used to aid fluoroscopic visualization. This combination was chosen through consideration of celiac plexus block formulations and consultation with a pain anesthesiologist.

Results

Twenty-nine patients, 10 males (34%) and 19 females (66%) were included in the study. The average age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) of all patients was 53.45 ± 9.6 years, 82.59 ± 12.12 kg, 166.21 ± 8.8 cm and 29.55 ± 4.21, respectively. Body mass index was over 25 in 23 of 29 patients (79.3%). The onset of pain was greater than 1 year in 23 (79.3%) patients and less than 1 year in 6 patients (20.7%) (Table 1). Seventeen patients (58.6%) reported pain after falling backwards, and 4 (13.8%) experienced pain following a traffic accident. In 2 patients (6.9%) the pain was due to cancer and in 6 patients (20.7%) it was idiopathic (Table 1). X-ray evaluations were normal in 10 patients (34.5%), while an anterior coccygeal angulation was found in 19 patients (65.5%) (Table 1).

### The role of neuromodulation in chronic pelvic pain: a review article [^112DBzcy]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a complex, heterogeneous condition affecting both female and male patients with significant effects on quality of life. Chronic pelvic pain is a prevalent but often underdiagnosed condition due to the variation in patient presentation, a gap in communication among specialties, under-reporting of the syndrome, and lack of standardized diagnostic criteria with a subsequent delay in diagnosis. The mechanism of CPP is complex due to multifactorial etiologies of pain and its vast anatomy and innervation. Potential causes of pelvic pain include the nerves, muscles, bone, or organs of the reproductive, gastrointestinal, urological, musculoskeletal, vascular, neurological, and psychological systems.

Objectives

The objective of this article is to review the anatomy of the pelvis, share current lead placement locations, and discuss the current evidence for neuromodulation in the management of chronic pelvic pain.

Study Design

This is a narrative review of current literature on neuromodulation for chronic pelvic pain.

Setting

A database review.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed to gather literature on neuromodulation for chronic pelvic pain.

Results

Traditionally, pelvic pain has been managed with conservative therapies such as physical therapy, pharmacological agents, trigger point injections, botulinum toxin injections, ganglion impar blocks, caudal epidural steroid injections, or superior and inferior hypogastric blocks, but with the evolution of the neuromodulation, there are new advances to incorporate this modality in the management of chronic pelvic pain.

Limitations

This review article possesses limitations and includes published data, excluding case reports. For this reason, some applications of neuromodulation for chronic pelvic pain may be missed.

Conclusions

Neuromodulation may include spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, and peripheral nerve stimulation. Specifically, neuromodulation utilizes electrical stimulation or pharmacological agents to modulate a nerve and alter pain signals. Currently used locations for lead placement include intracranial, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, sacral nerve roots, or at a peripheral nerve. As the field of pelvic pain continues to evolve, continued evidence for neuromodulatory interventions is needed.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^111FQAjs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Examination findings from 29 patients with coccydynia

Twenty patients (68.9%) underwent DB only, while 9 (31.1%) underwent DB+ pulse RFT. In all patients, a DB with a total of 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine+ 40 mg methylprednisolone was administered during the first procedure. The block was performed using either a transsacrococcygeal or intercoccygeal approach.

The average VAS score before undergoing the impar ganglion block was 7.4 ± 1 and decreased to 5.2 ± 1.5 following the procedure. At the 3-month evaluation period, the average VAS score was 4.7 ± 2.1, and at the 3–6 month and 6 month-1 year evaluations the scores were 4.3 ± 2.4 and 4.2 ± 2.6, respectively. VAS scores were found to be significantly lower in patients at the 3-month, 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year follow-up evaluations (p < 0.05) (Table 2). VAS scores before the block, after the block and in the first 3-month follow-up period were similar in both the DB block and DB+ pulse RFT block groups. However, patients who received RFT had significantly lower VAS scores at the 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year follow-up periods (Table 3). In these periods, VAS score was lower than 4 in 9 patients who received DB block and in 8 patients who received DB + pulse RFT block. Percentage of improvement in pain score after treatment were 40% in DB block and 72% DB + RFT block. The patients were allowed to take gabapentin, pregabalin or a single tablet of tramadol and paracetamol (37.5 mg + 325 mg) combination when required. In 4 patients, the VAS scores remained ≥ 7 throughout all of the follow-up measurements (3 patients in the DB group and 1 patient in the DB + pulse RFT group). These patients were referred to surgery for coccyx excision.

### Retrospective evaluation of pain in patients with coccydynia who underwent impar ganglion block [^1137RuN1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Gündüz et al. noted that trauma, especially after a backwards fall, was the cause of coccydynia in 50% of patients. Similar to this finding, trauma was the leading cause of coccydynia in our study: 58.6% experienced a fall and for 13.8%, a traffic accident was the origin. X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging are useful tools for diagnosing sarcococcygeal hypermobility, hypomobility, fracture and luxation, especially in cases of trauma. In our patients, only X-ray images could be evaluated and were found to be normal in 10 patients (34.5%), while coccygeal angulation at the distal end was observed in the remaining 19 patients (65.5%).

Pain relief can be achieved with conservative medical treatment in 90% of patients with coccydynia. Patients referred to our policlinic were treated with multiple analgesics including NSAIDs, paracetamol and seating cushions. An impar ganglion block was performed if the VAS score remained ≥ 4 despite conservative treatment. Under fluoroscopy, 20 patients (68.9%) received only DB, and 9 patients (31.1%) received DB + pulse RFT at 42 °C for 2 min at the impar ganglion area. Gonnade et al. reported a significant decrease in pain in 31 patients following impar ganglion blocks in a 1-year follow-up study. We observed a similar significant reduction in pain scores in our patients. The average VAS score was 7.4 ± 1.6 before the block, which then significantly decreased in the first 3 months, 3–6 months and 6 months-1 year evaluations post-procedure.

NEUROLYTIC PROCEDURES FOR RELIEF OF SEVERE OR REFRACTORY PAIN

Pain impulses from the pelvic region are transmitted via somatic nerves from muscle, bone, skin, and connective tissue and via sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and plexuses from visceral organs. Neurolytic procedures, and in some cases also neural stimulation, often can interrupt or modulate pain impulses transmitted within this neural network. - However, because of the complexity of this pain network, adequate relief often requires multimodal treatment such as with both a neurolytic procedure and systemic pharmacotherapy.

Nerve Blocks

Neurolysis is the targeted destruction of a nerve or nerve plexus with chemical agents (alcohol or phenol), heat (radiofrequency ablation), or cold (cryoablation). If the appropriate and adequately trained staff member(s) and necessary equipment are available, these procedures should be considered when pharmacologic pain treatment results in inadequate pain control or intolerable side effects. Typically, neurolytic blocks should be performed with fluoroscopic, ultrasonographic, or computed tomography guidance. Although these procedures are not effective for every patient, they usually provide some degree of analgesia, from partial to complete, that lasts from days to several months and reduces the opioid requirement. -

Neurolysis of the superior hypogastric plexus is the most common block for pelvic cancer pain. The superior hypogastric plexus lies anterior to the L5/S1 disk and innervates the cervix, uterus, bladder, and rectum. Complications such as neural injury, bowel perforation, retroperitoneal bleeding, bowel and bladder dysfunction, infection, and diarrhea are rare.-

Ganglion impar block is a safe and relatively easy procedure to treat visceral pelvic, perineal, and anal pain. The ganglion impar lies in the presacral space near the sacrococcygeal ligament and provides innervation to the perineum, distal rectum, distal urethra, vagina, and vulva. Image-guided neurolysis of the ganglion impar appears to be a generally safe and effective procedure. -

Intrathecal drug delivery systems infuse analgesics directly into the spinal fluid at the appropriate spinal level via a subcutaneous catheter connected to an implanted, refillable drug pump. This method of analgesia can be very effective but is expensive, requires specialized equipment and well-trained staff members, and should not be initiated during an infection. - Because of the risk of permanent neurologic injury, intrathecal saddle neurolysis of the sacral nerve roots should be considered only as a last resort for severe refractory pain in a patient near the end of life. -

### Transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar: radiofrequency application for the treatment of chronic intractable coccydynia [^111xrAmb]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coccydynia is a condition that is defined by pain in the coccyx, which is the inferior region of the vertebral column, comprising approximately four rudimentary vertebrae that articulate with the sacrum. Moreover, the coccyx has a close anatomical relationship with the sacral nerve roots and terminal end of the sympathetic chain called the ganglion impar. The ganglion impar (also known as the ganglion of Walther) is a solitary anatomical feature that is found on the ventral surface of the sacrococcygeal joint and provides nociceptive and sympathetic innervation to the perineal and anal areas.

Coccydynia is a rare condition of various etiologies, affecting females five times more than males and is also associated with obesity. Trauma is the most common etiological cause of coccydynia as a result of falling on the buttocks, repetitive microtrauma, or childbirth. Coccydynia is diagnosed on the basis of a patient's history and clinical examination. Coccyx pain is typically provoked by sitting, and pain may present during rectal examination.

Several methods are currently used for treating coccydynia, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intrarectal manipulation, epidural injections, ganglion impar blocks, and radiofrequency treatment (RFT). For patients who do not respond to these forms of intervention, coccygectomy is often recommended.

Wemm and Saberski used the transacrococcygeal method to reduce tissue trauma. RFT is a percutaneous minimally invasive procedure.

This study aimed to highlight the transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar and the use of RFT for treating chronic intractable coccydynia.

Risk stratification for interventional spine and pain procedures — classification of procedures by potential risk for bleeding is detailed, noting that interventional techniques for chronic cancer and noncancer pain face variable risks depending on anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy, age, anatomy, the specific region of interest, and obesity. Low-risk procedures include Trigger point and muscular injections (including piriformis injection), Peripheral joints, Peripheral nerve blocks, Sacroiliac joint and ligament injections and nerve blocks, Caudal epidural injections, and Ganglion impar blocks. Intermediate-risk procedures include Facet joint interventions (intra-articular injections, nerve blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy), Lumbar transforaminal epidural injections at L4, L5, Lumbar intradiscal procedures, Hypogastric plexus blocks, Lumbar sympathetic blocks, Peripheral nerve stimulation trial and implant, Pocket revision and implantable pulse generator/ intrathecal pump replacement, Caudal percutaneous adhesiolysis, Lumbar percutaneous disc decompression (L4/5 or below), Lumbar vertebral augmentation (below L4), Intervertebral spinous prosthesis, and Lumbar discography. High-risk procedures include Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar interlaminar epidurals, Cervical, thoracic and lumbar above L3 transforaminal epidural injections, Spinal cord stimulator trial and implant, Percutaneous adhesiolysis with interlaminar or transforaminal approach, Percutaneous disc decompression (above L4/5), Sympathetic blocks (stellate ganglion; thoracic splanchnic, celiac plexus), Thoracic and cervical intradiscal procedures, Vertebral augmentation, lumbar (above L4), thoracic and cervical, Intrathecal catheter and pump implant, and Interspinous prosthesis and MILD*. The table specifies that Patients with high risk of bleeding (e.g., old age, history of bleeding tendency, concurrent uses of other anticoagulants/antiplatelets, liver cirrhosis or advanced liver disease, and advanced renal disease) undergoing low or intermediate-risk procedures should be treated at intermediate or high risk, respectively.

### Transsacrococcygeal approach to ganglion impar: radiofrequency application for the treatment of chronic intractable coccydynia [^114zcir2]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Although the sacrococcygeal method is a safe and successful method, experience is as important for this method as for any other application. The fact that our entire operation was conducted by an experienced algologist could be an important factor that increased our chances of success. Multicenter-randomized studies can be prospectively conducted to verify this.

Larger population studies can be conducted using other treatment methods, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intrarectal manipulation, epidural injections, and blocking the ganglion impar with local anesthetics, as control groups to understand whether RFT is a truly effective treatment for these patients.

Coccydynia patients attempt various treatment methods before they are diagnosed. This situation prolongs the process until treatment. The effectiveness of the treatment using RFT compared with the period of pain before treatment can be investigated in subsequent studies. In our study, although the period of pain before treatment for all patients was recorded, we did not create groups according to pain duration and did not examine the treatment efficacy between the groups. To perform such studies, a larger population may be required.

Transsacrococcygeal RFT is a method that can be easily applied, has few complications, and can be repeated. Because transsacrococcygeal RFT is a minimally invasive treatment option, it should be considered before surgically treating patients with chronic coccydynia.

Overall, it can be concluded that LSBs are an efficient way to deal with sympathetic pain, especially in patients with CRPS. Even though there are other indications to perform LSBs, the majority of the controlled studies in the literature involve CRPS cases. The literature about other applications of LSB merely consists of case reports. New studies involving other indications would be of value in this regard. However, it is clear that the cases that require LSBs are relatively rare, which may be a limiting factor in conducting major controlled studies.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of the transsacrococcygeal approach on ganglion impar RFT in patients with chronic coccydynia.

Methods

We retrospectively examined the data of 41 patients at the Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Faculty of Medicine, Maltepe University (Pain Clinic), between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 46.68 ± 11.00 years (range 28–67 [46] years). The average pain duration was 3.10 ± 1.37 years. The difference between visual analog scale scores of the pre-and postprocedure was statistically significant. In the examinations carried out in the sixth month of the treatment, 90.2% of patients had a successful outcome, whereas treatment failed in 9.8% of patients. According to our patients' data, most of them had pain due to a trauma, were female, and overweight. Visual analog scale difference between preprocedure and early postprocedure, preprocedure and first month, preprocedure and sixth month were statistically significant (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Based on the lower pain scores and low complication rates after the operations, the results suggest that application of RFT on ganglion impar by the transsacrococcygeal approach is an effective and safe method for the treatment of chronic coccydynia. Patient selection, technique, and experience are the most important factors affecting the success of this method.

### A review of the use of stellate ganglion block in the treatment of PTSD [^116HxnuY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Current treatments for PTSD are often not effective or acceptable to the patient. There are a number of emerging new treatments. One promising new one is stellate ganglion block, an anesthetic treatment for pain which relieves symptoms of severe and chronic PTSD in some patients. The focus of this chapter is to summarize clinical evidence available for the effectiveness of cervical sympathetic ganglion injection called stellate ganglion block (SGB), as well as demonstrate possible clinical applications of its use. Cervical sympathetic blockade involves injecting a local anesthetic next to a group of nerves (ganglion) in the neck. The technique has been used clinically since 1925 with very few side effects. Finally, the neurobiology of SGB is discussed. Challenges to the use of SGB include the lack of randomized clinical trials and practitioners familiar with the use of SGB for PTSD.

### Dorsal clitoral nerve injury following transobturator midurethral sling [^114vTeuc]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 51-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of pain described as pinching localized to her clitoris with radiation along her left medial thigh, which commenced following an anterior and posterior repair and transobturator sling placement for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). At the time of presentation, she was experiencing intractable left clitoral, groin, and vaginal pain; intimacy and movement caused radiating pain in her left lower abdomen, legs, and ankles. The patient gave written informed consent to be included in the study as well as for the use of the photos.

Previous treatments including physical therapy with vaginal dilators, amitriptyline, bupropion, gabapentin, and a ganglion impar block had been proved ineffective. At presentation, she was taking topiramate, which decreased the frequency and intensity of her episodic pain.

Examination revealed abdominal pinprick hyperalgesia, diminished light brushing sensation along the ilioinguinal nerve, and normal pelvic muscle movement. (Note: a detailed description of neurosensory assessment techniques will be presented in future manuscripts.)

Urogenital examination showed mechanical allodynia with a delayed onset of burning sensation. For the purpose of the aforementioned examination, the examiner gently moved a lubricated cotton swab transvaginally along the right and left paravaginal space. Gentle downward posterior vaginal traction caused shooting pain along the left labia minora and clitoris, followed by an aching pain generalized to the lower abdomen. Collectively, these findings along with other elements of the patient's history and examination suggested entrapment neuropathy that was peripherally maintained and likely related to scar contracture. To confirm this diagnosis, we proceeded with a selective nerve block and utilized a process of elimination to determine which nerve was the primary cause of the patient's pain. Doing so, we were able to conclude that DNC was the nerve causing the majority of the patient's pain.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^114hd2KE]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Celiac plexus block (CPB) and splanchnic plexus block

The celiac plexus lies anterior to the aorta and epigastrium. The plexus extends for several centimeters in front of the aorta and laterally around the aorta. Fibers within the plexus arise from preganglionic splanchnic nerves, parasympathetic preganglionic nerves from the vagus, some sensory nerves from the phrenic and vagus nerves, and sympathetic post-ganglionic fibers. Afferent fibers concerned with nociception pass diffusely through the celiac plexus and represent the primary target of celiac plexus blockade.

There are two main approaches to apply the CPB: anterior and posterior approach. In the anterior approach, a needle is inserted through the anterior abdominal wall directly into the region of the celiac plexus and a neurolytic agent is injected into the antecrural space. One of the classic posterior approaches is the fluoroscopy-guided two-needle retrocrural approach. In this approach, the patient is placed in prone position with a pillow under the abdomen to flex the thoracolumbar spine. The T12 vertebral body and the spinous process of the L1 vertebral body are then identified with fluoroscopy. Two 20-G needles are inserted bilaterally, oriented 45° toward the midline and about 20° cephalad. They are advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to ensure contact with the inferolateral portion of the T12 vertebral body. Ultimately, the tips of the needles should be just anterior to the lateral border of the vertebral body and just behind the aorta and vena cava in the retrocrural space. On the fluoroscopic anteroposterior view, contrast should be confined to the midline and concentrated near the T12 vertebral body. The smooth posterior border of psoas fascia should be observed on the lateral view. In the posterior transcrural approach, a needle is inserted under C-arm or CT guidance caudal to 12th rib and cephalad to the transverse process of L1 toward the anterolateral surface of L1 corpus on the left side. Continuous aspiration is applied as the needle might penetrate aorta. If blood is aspirated, then the needle must be further moved anteriorly so that the anterior wall of aorta should be passed. Contrast distribution should be on both sides of midline over the anterior surface of the aorta for a successful CPB. Although anterior approach necessitates traversing abdominal structures such as intestines and liver, this is ordinarily inconsequential, well tolerated, and quicker. The advantages of performing an anterior CPB are the ability to perform the procedure while the patient is supine, only one needle is used decreasing the discomfort, and reduced risk of accidental neurologic injury related to the retrocrural spread of drug to somatic nerve roots or epidural and subarachnoid spaces.CT, US, and fluoroscopy can all be used for guidance, while CT is the preferred option when available. Recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become a preferred approach since it defines the plexus and adjacent structures in detail.

### Neural blockade for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery [^116GK9dX]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery is predominantly a neuropathic pain syndrome affecting 25% to 60% of patients and related to injury of the intercostobrachial nerve, intercostal nerves, and other nerves in the region. Neural blockade can be useful for the identification of nerves involved in neuropathic pain syndromes or to be used as a treatment in its own right. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for neural blockade as a potential diagnostic tool or treatment for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. In this systematic review, we found only 7 studies (n = 135) assessing blocks directed at 3 neural structures-stellate ganglion, paravertebral plexus, and intercostal nerves-but none focusing on the intercostobrachial nerve. The quality of the studies was low and efficacy inconclusive, suggesting a need for well-designed, high-quality studies for this common clinical problem.

### Dorsal root ganglion: a key to understanding the therapeutic effects of the erector spinae plane (ESP) and other intertransverse process blocks? [^1171yqpq]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Since its description in 2016, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has become a widely employed regional anesthetic technique and kindled interest in a range of related techniques, collectively termed intertransverse process blocks. There has been ongoing controversy over mechanism of action of the ESPB, mainly due to incongruities between results of cutaneous sensory testing, clinical efficacy studies, and investigations into the neural structures that are reached by injected local anesthetic (LA). This paper reviews the spread of LA to the paravertebral and epidural space and the cutaneous anesthesia in ESPB, with specific emphasis on the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). We hypothesize that the DRG, due to its unique and complex microarchitecture, represents a key therapeutic target for modulation of nociceptive signaling in regional anesthesia. This paper discusses how the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the DRG may be one of the factors underpinning the clinical analgesia observed in ESPB and other intertransverse process blocks.

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^114WKagF]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The complications of GIB are rarely reported but can include motor, sexual, bladder, and bowel dysfunction, perforation of rectum and sciatic nerve impingement, and to a rarer extent, infection. Overall, it is considered a safe and effective technique in perineal and coccyx pain.

Overall, GIB seems useful in the treatment of intractable coccyx and perineal pain. However, the lack of controlled trials makes it hard to make a substantial comment on its efficacy.

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^1156iPR5]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Response to local anesthetics in painful nerves does not necessarily correlate with the half-life of the local anesthetic. Often, pain in the distribution of a peripheral nerve, such as a pericranial nerve, may last for weeks or more after a nerve block with a local anesthetic with a half-life of less than 8 h. The reduction of nociceptive neuronal activity of the trigeminocervical complex may play a role in the pain relief with such blocks. Alternatively, a nerve block may not eliminate or significantly reduce pain, which is chronic and has a component of central sensitization. Chronic pain, especially of the head or face, can lead to afferent sensory and pain pathway hyperexcitability via neuroplastic kindling, including chronic release of inflammatory neuropeptides. This can lead to cutaneous allodynia, and an abnormal resting state of cellular hyperexcitability as well as changes in brain activity. Once there is a central sensitization to pain, anesthetizing the peripheral nerve with local anesthetic may not alleviate the pain, and medications usually used for the treatment of pain may produce limited results. Fortunately, central sensitization can be reversible. Several medications have shown promise in treating allodynia symptoms and central sensitization in pain, and the treatment duration, often longer than multiple weeks, may play a role in the efficacy of treating painful conditions. As such, future studies of guanfacine for the treatment of chronic pain should also focus on repeated doses over a longer treatment window. Furthermore, future studies should also include comparisons of guanfacine with other adjuncts, such as steroids, and targeting the trigeminal ganglion should be considered.

### Imaging coccygeal trauma and coccydynia [^1122Q6Bc]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

The coccygeal region has complex anatomy, much of which may contribute to or be the cause of coccyx region pain (coccydynia). This anatomy is well depicted at imaging, and management is often dictated by what structures are involved. Coccydynia is a common condition that is known to be difficult to evaluate and treat. However, imaging can aid in determining potential causes of pain to help guide management. Commonly, coccydynia (coccygodynia) occurs after trauma and appears with normal imaging features at static neutral radiography, but dynamic imaging with standing and seated lateral radiography may reveal pathologic coccygeal motion that is predictive of pain. In addition, several findings seen at cross-sectional imaging in patients with coccydynia can point to a source of pain that may be subtle and easily overlooked. Radiology can also offer a role in management of coccygeal region pain with image-guided pain management procedures such as ganglion impar block. In addition to mechanical coccyx pain, a host of other conditions involving the sacrococcygeal region may cause coccydynia, which are well depicted at imaging. These include neoplasm, infection, crystal deposition, and cystic formations such as pilonidal cyst. The authors review a variety of coccydynia causes, their respective imaging features, and common management strategies. © RSNA, 2020.

### Paraplegia after intercostal neurolysis with phenol [^114xg38p]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe pain is a frequently encountered symptom that affects the quality of life for advanced cancer patients. It has been estimated that 60%–90% of all patients dying of cancer will experience pain in the terminal phase of their disease.–Pain can be managed using analgesics and adjuvant therapy titrated according to the World Health Organization's analgesic ladder.

When pain is resistant to standard therapy or when severe side effects of analgesics occur, alternative analgesic techniques should be considered. These include regional nerve blocks, intrathecal analgesic delivery methods, spinal cord stimulation, neurolytic blocks, and vertebroplasty. Injections of neurolytic agents to destroy nerves and interrupt pain pathways have been used for many years. In terminally ill cancer patients, phenol has been administered using the intrathecal or epidural routes for the blockade of sympathetic ganglia (celiac, superior hypogastric, ganglion impar, and so on). Current knowledge and techniques allow these procedures to be performed safely and expeditiously, even though the risk–benefit ratio associated with neurolysis techniques is narrow. The use of phenol for neuroablation for chronic malignant pain is widely accepted, especially when the life expectancy is low. We discuss a case of paraplegia followed by phenol intercostal neurolysis for intractable intercostal neuralgia.

### Sphenopalatine ganglion blockade: a review and proposed modification of the transnasal technique [^114C5bNv]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The sphenopalatine ganglion block has been utilized over the last century for a wide variety of maladies. This paper provides a brief history of the use of the sphenopalatine ganglion block, a review of the sphenopalatine ganglion anatomy, and the diagnoses which currently warrant its use. The traditional transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block is described and our modification of the traditional technique is proposed. A case study is described in which sphenopalatine block pain control in a patient with a 20-year history of poorly controlled pain from bilateral herpetic keratitis.

### Impact of stellate ganglion block on tissue blood flow / oxygenation and postoperative mandibular nerve hypoesthesia: a cohort study [^117BraCi]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although a stellate ganglion block (SGB) increases tissue blood flow in the mandibular region, the change in tissue oxygenation after SGB and therapeutic effect of SGB for postoperative mandibular nerve hypoesthesia remain to be established. The study aim was to measure the change in tissue oxygenation in the mandibular region after SGB.

Methods

To determine the variation in tissue oxygenation in the mandibular region, the tissue oxygen index (TOI; percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in the total hemoglobin) was measured at the skin near the mental foramen bilaterally, at the primary site of unilateral SGB, achieved using 6 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride, for the treatment of bilateral postoperative mandibular nerve injury. The primary outcome of this study is the temporal variation in TOI after SGB (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes after SGB), and the control group in this study is the TOI at the end of SGB injection (0 minute). All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation and 95% confidence interval (CI). Repeated-measures analysis of variance with Dunnett's test was used to determine parametric statistical significance. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Thirteen patients were enrolled in this study. On both the blocked and contralateral side, the TOI was significantly increased compared to that before SGB (ΔTOI at 15 minute after SGB, 5.87 ± 2.89%, P < .001, 95% CI: 4.122 to 7.617% in the blocked side, 1.88 ± 2.73%, P = 0.005, 95% CI: 1.877 to 2.725% in the contralateral side).

Conclusions

Unilateral SGB using 6 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride results in an increase in tissue oxygenation in the mandibular region. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that a series of SGBs may contribute to a more rapid recovery of postoperative trigeminal nerve injury.

### Machine learning analysis to identify predictive factors of caudal epidural pulse radiofrequency in the treatment of coccygodynia [^114Aobr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ML has emerged as a phenomenon that has been in demand in many different fields in recent years. Using algorithms that can develop their own rules from the data set on hand, ML can make predictions against future uncertain situations using this existing data for learning purposes.

Consistent with the literature on other fields, the use of ML in healthcare systems is also increasing daily. Unlike traditional statistical models, ML models are generally more flexible and adaptable to various data types and tasks. Recently, studies are using the technique for different types of diseases or treatments, eg, oncological, cardiovascular, diabetes, infectious diseases, digestive system diseases, etc. However, pain medicine has not yet taken its place among these varying areas. ML can significantly impact pain medicine by providing more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and more effective treatments for patients suffering from pain.

Coccygodynia is a condition characterized by pain, tenderness, or discomfort associated with the coccyx and surrounding structures, localized in the sacrococcygeal region. The most common cause is direct trauma caused by falling (50–65%), and also it may develop in women due to trauma triggered by giving birth or repetitive microtraumas. Diagnosis is based on patient history and clinical examination.

In treating chronic coccygodynia, interventional treatments can be applied when conservative treatments such as analgesic medications, physical therapy modalities, and manipulation are insufficient. It has a close anatomical relation with the terminal end of the sympathetic chain, which it proposes as the sacrococcygeal nerve fibers and ganglion impar. Interventional methods, including nerve blocks and radiofrequency applications targeting these two structures, are essential in treatment.CEPRF therapy is used for pain syndromes such as coccygodynia, post laminectomy syndrome, post herpetic neuralgia, and polyneuropathy.

In a study by Cho et al in a rat model, they found that CEPRF administration suppressed microglial activity and reduced nociceptive cells at the L3-S1 levels, thus demonstrating its positive effect on nociceptive and neuropathic pain.

Although there are many factors that are hypothesized to be effective on treatment success, parameters such as the presence of permanent subluxation and prolonged symptom duration may be major factors. However, the literature information is still limited. In this study, we used the pre-treatment data of 108 patients who applied to our clinic with complaints of coccygodynia. In order to define the predictive factors, we used ML techniques explained in the following sections, and we analyzed the post-treatment success of CEPRF treatment for 6-months.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^114LQTeS]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — stellate ganglion block (SGB) for PTSD summarizes two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mixed findings and an overall neutral recommendation. "Two RCTs have assessed stellate ganglion block (SGB) as a treatment for PTSD". One RCT found "No difference… in the critical outcome of provider-rated PTSD at 1 week, 1 month, or 3 months after the intervention". In another RCT, the active SGB group "received two injections of anesthetic 2 weeks apart", sham "received two saline injections", and "Six weeks after the second injection" there was a benefit on provider-rated PTSD severity; however, limitations included unblinding risk and that "the follow-up period of only 6 weeks is too brief". Considering both trials, "the Work Group concluded the current evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against SGB as a treatment for PTSD".

### A new and easy technique to block the stellate ganglion [^115Pajyk]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The stellate ganglion block has been utilized in a variety of painful conditions ranging from sympathetically mediated pain in the upper extremity to the pain associated with intractable angina. A number of techniques are used to block the stellate ganglion.

Objective

To describe a new and easy approach to block the stellate ganglion using an oblique view.

Description Of A New Technique

The patient is placed in the supine position with the new slightly extended, and the head rotated slightly to the side opposite the side to be blocked. The fluoroscopic beam is directed in an anteroposterior direction until the C5/6 disc is well visualized. Subsequently, the fluoroscopic beam is rotated obliquely, ipsilateral to the side where blockade is desired. Under real-time imaging, a single pass is made with a 25-gauge spinal needle to contact the bone. At this point, the needle tip is contacting and resting at the junction between the uncinate process and the vertebral body.

Conclusion

We have described a new approach for stellate ganglion block to be performed under oblique fluoroscopy without technical difficulty or complications.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^114QT17h]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Surgical techniques for TN — classification and evidence scope, including peripheral techniques. Surgical interventions are classified by principal target into peripheral techniques, percutaneous Gasserian ganglion techniques, gamma knife radiosurgery, and posterior fossa vascular decompression; the literature search found three Class I RCTs, one Class II prospective cohort study, and a handful of Class III studies, with the majority evidence Class IV, and direct comparisons between procedures are insufficient. For peripheral techniques, which involve block or destruction of trigeminal nerve portions distal to the Gasserian ganglion, two small Class I RCTs using streptomycin and lidocaine versus lidocaine alone showed no effect on pain.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116JMMdQ]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic review (level 1) by Cepeda et al. was published in 2002, which reviewed all available literature regarding local anesthetic sympathetic nerve blockade from 1916 through 1999. The general conclusion of this systematic review was that SNB was not effective. These older reports tend to be relatively imprecise and performed on heterogeneous/nonspecific cohorts. Although the techniques did not show a significant effect by this analysis of general diagnostic groups, it is important to note that a sub-set of patients may respond (level 4). Less than 20% of the articles reviewed by Cepeda critically evaluated the success of their blocks.

A significant confounding factor is a lack of consensus on defining "a successful sympathetic block". There are several studies available to clarify relevant issues. Price et al. performed a comparative study of local anesthetic versus saline stellate ganglion or lumbar sympathetic blocks in seven CRPS patients in a double-blind crossover fashion. Onset of analgesic effect occurred within 30 minutes in both groups, with the local anesthetic group (lidocaine/bupivacaine mixture) having a significantly greater duration of relief (mean of 3 d, 18 h vs 19 h), thus showing at least short-term analgesic efficacy of local anesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS (level 2). Bonelli et al. performed a randomized trial of stellate ganglion block versus "active control" (in the form of guanethidine IV regional block). They found significant improvement in both groups, with no significant difference between the SGB and IVRA guanethidine groups (level 3), although this finding is difficult to interpret given the absence of a non-block control condition.

### Conventional versus high-voltage, long-term pulse radiofrequency of ganglion impar in perineal pain with advanced rectal cancer: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial [^114Bme8N]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we adopted a double-center, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind clinical trial design to investigate the safety and efficacy of CRF and H-PRF in the treatment of perineal pain and improvement of quality of life in patients with advanced rectal cancer by targeting the ganglion impar. The results demonstrated that the long-term effectiveness of CRF exceeded that of H-PRF.

Occurrence of primary perineal pain has been linked to sympathetic sensory coupling, and the ganglion impar is the distal ganglion of the sympathetic chain. B l ocking the ganglion impar can significantly alleviate perineal pain and decrease the need for opioid analgesics. Radiofrequency therapy is an effective technique for the management of ganglion impar. Radiofrequency pain treatment can be categorized into two modes: continuous radiofrequency ablation (CRF) and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF). Previous studies showed that patients experiencing primary perineal pain can experience a significant reduction in pain over a 6-month monitoring period following treatment with pulsed radiofrequency in the ganglion impar. Nicholas A Zacharias et al. found that PRF and CRF can alleviate sympathetic nerve-mediated pain, including the ganglion impar. Notably, CRF showed better long-term effects in controlling noncancerous perineal pain. In addition, PRF combined with plexus chemical destruction can achieve long-term pain control. The aforementioned studies demonstrate that PRF is still not ideal for long-term relief of perineal pain.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on postdural puncture headache: a consensus report from a multisociety international working group [^1178Gmqs]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) — sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB): The treatment of headache with sphenopalatine ganglion blocks (SPGBs) was first described in 1908, and its use in PDPH has only recently been investigated with mixed findings. The proposed mechanism of action is by blocking parasympathetic outflow from the sphenopalatine ganglion resulting in cerebral vasoconstriction and downregulation of neurogenic inflammatory mediators. Supporting evidence consists of observational studies and several case series and reports; evidence showing no benefit or equivocal results includes a meta-analysis and an RCT.

### Complications associated with stellate ganglion nerve block: a systematic review [^1155cj8u]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Stellate ganglion nerve blockade (SGNB) is a vital tool in our armamentarium for the treatment of various chronic pain syndromes. SGNB can be performed using the traditional landmark-based approach, or with image guidance using either fluoroscopy or ultrasound. In this review, we systematically analyzed reported SGNB-related complications between 1990 and 2018. Seven databases were queried for SGNB between January 1, 1990 and November 27, 2018. Search results of the complications associated with SGNB were reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Out of a total of 1909 articles, 67 articles met our inclusion criteria, yielding 260 cases with adverse events. In 134 of the 260 (51.5%) cases, SGNB was performed with image guidance. Sixty-four (24.6%) and 70 (26.9%) of the complication cases reported the use of ultrasound and fluoroscopy guidance, respectively. One hundred and seventy-eight (68.4%) patients had medication-related or systemic side effects, and 82 (31.5%) had procedure-related or local side effects. There was one report of death due to massive hematoma leading to airway obstruction. There was one case report of quadriplegia secondary to pyogenic cervical epidural abscess and discitis following an SGNB. Complications following SGNB have been reported with both landmark-based techniques and with imaging guidance using fluoroscopy or ultrasound. In our systematic review, most adverse events that were reported occurred during or shortly after SGNB. Vigilance, American Society of Anesthesiologists standard monitors for conscious sedation, and accessibility to resuscitation equipment are vital to the safe performance of SGNB.

### Mechanisms of neural blockade [^113HRVK9]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Neural blockade remains a key diagnostic and treatment modality for interventional pain management. Most of the techniques used in chronic and acute pain management today evolved out of different techniques used by surgeons and anesthesiologists alike to facilitate surgical procedures and alleviate intra- and postoperative pain. Many of these techniques were developed and introduced into medical practice during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were only recently challenged by increasing neurophysiologic understanding and modern imaging studies. A brief historical overview of the topic of neural blockade as well as current knowledge of mechanisms and clinical aspects of nerve blocks are considered. The review focuses on relevant aspects of anatomy, cell physiology, molecular mechanisms of effect, and clinical aspects of nerve blocks.

### Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks in the head and neck for chronic pain management: the anatomy, sonoanatomy, and procedure [^114UNJba]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound guided nerve blocks have become a popular tool in the armamentarium for pain physicians because of its advantages over fluoroscopy by offering portable, radiation-free and real-time imaging. But ultrasound guided procedures require training and practice to gain the expertise. There is a scarcity of review articles describing ultrasound guided injections techniques for nerve blocks of the head and neck.

Objective

To elucidate the anatomy, sonoanatomy, indications, techniques, side effects and complications for the most frequently utilized nerve blocks of the head and neck in chronic pain management.

Study Design

Narrative review.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Methods

Literature review of publications in English language of the related topics using Medline (Ovid) search engine.

Results

Deep cervical plexus block, cervical sympathetic ganglion block, trigeminal nerve and pterygopalatine ganglion block at the pterygopalatine fossa, greater occipital nerve block, third occipital nerve and medial branch block, and cervical selective nerve root block are discussed in this paper. The review begins with in depth discussion about the anatomy of the target nerve, followed by reviewing the available literature on the indications for the procedures. Detailed description of the procedure techniques is also presented. The volume and selection of medications is also discussed if there is available research. The review will conclude with summary of side effects, complications and precautions.

Limitation

We only review those nerve blocks of the head and neck that would benefit from ultrasound guided injections in chronic pain management. Other nerve blocks such as transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block, the interscalene brachial plexus block, superficial and intermediate cervical plexus block, anterior suprascapular nerve block, superficial trigeminal nerve block are not discussed due to either that ultrasound guidance is not warranted or they are rarely utilized in chronic pain management. This paper is not a systematic review, thus it might not include all the available evidence. Many of the available evidence is case series and case reports. More randomized control studies are warranted in the future to validate these techniques.

Conclusion

Ultrasound guided nerve blocks of the head and neck are useful techniques for pain physicians to learn.

### A novel approach to transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion injection [^1155HX2j]. Pain Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sphenopalatine ganglion block is used to treat headache and facial pain. There are transnasal, transoral and lateral approaches to establish the blockade. The transnasal application of topical anesthetic is the simplest and most common technique among the three. However, the diffusion of topical anesthetic to the ganglion is unpredictable and the blockade is not durable.

Objective

To describe a novel transnasal injection technique to block sphenopalatine ganglion.

Methods

The technique includes topical anesthesia to the nasal mucosa between the middle and inferior turbinates from nares to the nasopharynx, followed by a needle insertion in the same tract guided by its tailored plastic cover-sheath for blocking agent injection to the ganglion.

Results

Fluoroscopy revealed that with this technique the needle tip located near the medial pterygoid plate at the level of the middle concha and contrast flowed superoposteriorly to the maxilla without vascular uptake. Pain relief for this patient was prolonged from one day with topical technique to four weeks with this technique. The subsequent blocks without fluoroscopy provided similar prolonged pain relief.

Conclusion

This method preserves the technical simplicity of the original transnasal approach and includes the predictability and durability of the blockade from needle injection.

### Pilot evaluation of a stellate ganglion block for the treatment of hot flashes [^116UWKjF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hot flashes are a significant problem in breast cancer patients, especially because the most effective therapy, estrogen, is often contraindicated. Based on recent pilot data from a single group supporting the use of a stellate ganglion block for the treatment of hot flashes, the present pilot trial was done to further evaluate the hypothesis that a stellate ganglion block may be a safe and effective therapy for hot flashes.

Methods

In women with breast cancer who had hot flashes, a stellate ganglion block was performed after 1 week of baseline hot flash data collection. The main efficacy measures were the changes from baseline in hot flash frequency and hot flash score during the 6th week.

Results

Ten patients were enrolled between 4/23/2009 and 7/10/2009; eight patients were evaluable. After the stellate ganglion block, the mean hot flash frequency and score decreased from baseline values by over 60% during some of the post-treatment weeks. The mean hot flash frequency and score at week 6 decreased from baseline values by 44% and 45%, respectively. There were no significant adverse events clearly attributed to the stellate ganglion blocks.

Conclusions

The results of this pilot trial support that stellate ganglion blocks may be a helpful therapy for hot flashes. A prospective placebo-controlled clinical trial should be done to more definitively determine this contention.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^111XPo3E]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sympathetic nerve blocks — safety of steroid injections: Sympathetic blocks may provide pain relief with or without the addition of corticosteroid in the injectate (Level of certainty: moderate). Use of particulate corticosteroids in stellate ganglion blocks may cause central nervous system injury (Level of certainty: low). Reported pain relief after stellate ganglion block is similar if performed under fluoroscopy or ultrasound guidance (Level of certainty: moderate). Image guidance may help decrease complications and improve accuracy of sympathetic blocks, including visceral sympathetic blocks (Level of certainty: moderate). Recommendations state that local anesthetic alone is sufficient for performing sympathetic blocks for pain relief (Grade C) and that imaging guidance with ultrasound or fluoroscopy is recommended for the performance of sympathetic blocks, with ultrasound permitting visualization of vascular structures (Grade B).

### Enhanced pain relief with guanfacine as an adjuvant for trigeminal nerve blocks: insights from a pheWAS-guided randomized controlled study [^116WKmjn]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ADRA2 agonists have been previously shown to mitigate neuropathic pain. For example, dexmedetomidine enhances the local anesthetic action of lidocaine and is used in the postoperative period for analgesia and for neuropathic pain crisis. Currently, guanfacine has a limited role in the treatment of pain, and is used for the treatment of ADHD and hypertension. However, guanfacine may have a role in treating opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that guanfacine has a longer antinociceptive effect compared to clonidine, and is nontoxic when used for analgesia, including when used in the subarachnoid space. Of the Alpha-2 agonists, guanfacine is least likely to cause hypotension or rebound hypertension with discontinuation. This study supports further investigation of guanfacine's role in the treatment of facial pain in those with painful trigeminal neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia when used with lidocaine in an image-guided peripheral nerve block.

Alpha 2A and 2B receptor subtypes are expressed in the spinal cord and are involved in pain modulation. The ADRA2B gene, encoding the Alpha 2B receptor, is expressed in humans on the trigeminal ganglion. In our study, we injected the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve near the foramen where these branches come off of the ganglion, rather than the ganglion, for safety purposes. While we have no explicit evidence the Alpha 2A receptor is expressed in the trigeminal branches in humans, and further studies are needed to investigate if the observed effects in our study are due to mechanistic action at the axonal or ganglion level, it is possible Alpha 2A is expressed outside the ganglion as it is found on the trigeminal nerve root in zebrafishand at the afferent terminal of the trigeminal nerves in mice. Alpha-2 receptor activation leads to negative feedback and a decrease in norepinephrine release. Also, guanfacine inhibits neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals through ADRA2 G proteins, inhibiting calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. This mechanism may have accounted for the enhanced analgesia observed in our study. Furthermore, although the volume of injectate used in our block procedure is within the amount described in the literature, it was large enough to have migrated to the trigeminal ganglion through the foramen rotundum or foramen ovale and reached the ADRA and other receptors on the trigeminal ganglion.

### Sphenopalatine ganglion blocks for post-dural puncture headache: a case report in a 3-year-old child [^1126TVRd]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-dural puncture headache is a distressing complication that may occur after lumbar puncture or unintentional dural puncture. Risk factors in the pediatric population have not been well elicited, and the true incidence is unknown. Conservative management includes conservative physical measures and medical therapies. Epidural blood patch remains the gold standard for managing severe refractory headache, but greater occipital nerve blocks and sphenopalatine ganglion blocks have been used with success. Sphenopalatine ganglion blocks are easy to perform, minimally invasive and, in the postoperative setting where epidural analgesia is utilized, provide an alternative that should be considered.

Chronic migraine — sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block and pulsed radiofrequency (pRF): The Work Group states, "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against pulsed radiofrequency procedure of the upper cervical nerves or sphenopalatine ganglion block for the treatment of chronic migraine". This recommendation is categorized as "Reviewed, New-replaced", and "The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low", with limitations including "small sample sizes". The balance of effects was neutral because "no side effects were reported for either intervention".

Table 20 — additional cases of hemorrhagic complications after regional blocks include stellate ganglion, axillary, and paravertebral techniques. A 62-y-old woman with sudden deafness underwent 4 Sequential (on alternate days) stellate ganglion blocks at C7, anterior paratracheal approach; 30 min after the 4th block she had throat discomfort, 2 h later dyspnea and difficulty swallowing, and ultimately had stoma closed on POD33 and was discharged on 41st day after the block. A 38-y-old healthy man having a procedure on the palmar surface of the wrist received an Axillary (transarterial) block; electromyogram at 4 wk demonstrated signs of neuropraxia with complete recovery after 6 mo. In a 65-y-old woman undergoing thoracotomy with a Paravertebral (loss of resistance to saline technique) block, there was blood aspiration on 2nd pass and 150 mL of blood was suctioned from the endotracheal tube; the initial surgery was canceled with discharge after 3 d, and she was readmitted 2 wk later for thoracotomy without a paravertebral block.

Results

Statistical analyses

Number Cruncher Statistical System 2007 (Kaysville, UT, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods (mean, SD, median, and frequency and rate). To compare data that were not normally distributed, Mann–Whitney U test was performed. To compare qualitative data, a Fisher–Freeman–Halton test was performed. To evaluate the relationships between variables, Spearman's correlation analysis was performed. Results within 95% confidence interval and with a P -value of < 0.05 were assessed.

We retrospectively analyzed the collected data of 41 patients (70.7% [n = 29] females and 29.3% [n = 12] males) with chronic coccydynia (pain for > 1 year) who were treated by RFT of the ganglion impar in our Pain Clinic between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014.

The mean age of the patients was 46.68 ± 11.00 years (range 28–67 [46] years). The average pain duration was 3.10 ± 1.37 years. Statistically significant differences were observed between the pre- and postprocedure VAS scores. The last evaluation after the treatment (at 6 months) revealed that 90.2% of patients had a successful outcome and 9.8% of patients were deemed failures. According to our patient data, the etiological cause for most patients was trauma and most of them were females and overweight (Table 1). Malignancy was the risk factor for the failure of procedure. However, sex was not a risk factor for treatment failure (Table 2). The VAS scores changed over time; the difference in the VAS scores between preprocedure and at all subsequent time points was statistically significant (P = 0.001) (Table 3 and Figure 3).

Palatal nerve blocks

Palatal nerve blocks were studied in three RCTs. As described above, Abu Elyazed and Mostafafound palatal blocks provided clinically relevant reduction of pain scores compared with a control group but was inferior to suprazygomatic maxillary block. One of the 30 patients treated with palatal blocks experienced a spontaneously resolving hematoma after palatal nerve block. Jonnavithula et al allocated patients into three groups in which no block, a palatal block with saline, or a palatal block with 0.5 mL bupivacaine 0.25% was applied. Patients receiving a palatal block with bupivacaine had clinically significant lower pain scores and reduced ibuprofen consumption compared with patients in the two control groups. Greater palatal nerve blocks were compared with an intraoperative intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg meperidine by Kamath and colleagues. For greater palatal nerve block, 1 mL bupivacaine 0.25% was applied on each side. Compared with intravenous meperidine, patients receiving palatal block had significantly lower pain scores and needed significantly less rescue analgesics during a 10-hour postoperative period. Among the three studies on palatal nerve blocks, only Abu Elyazed and Mostafa reported the use of acetaminophen, IV. However, none of the studies administered NSAIDs or COX-2specific inhibitors.

Sphenopalatine ganglion block

Parameswaran and colleaguesassessed sphenopalatine ganglion blocks with a transoral approach using 1 mL ropivacaine 0.75% as a standard dose. Patients receiving sphenopalatine ganglion blocks had a longer postsurgical pain-free period, but no significant differences were found for pain scores compared with the patients in the control group that did not receive sphenopalatine ganglion blocks. Postoperative rescue analgesic consumption was not reported, and the use of basic analgesia was not mentioned.

### Comparison of ganglion impar radiofrequency ablation and phenol neurolysis techniques for chronic coccydynia treatment… [^111UJjXD]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Radiofrequency ablation and phenol neurolysis of the ganglion impar are methods used in cases unresponsive to medication, particularly in patients who derive short-term or partial relief from the initial ganglion impar block. In clinical practice, clinicians frequently use these two injections in patients with treatment-resistant pain who only partially benefit from the initial blockade procedure. To date, the medical literature lacks a comprehensive study comparing the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation and phenol neurolysis in patients who partially benefit from ganglion impar block. Therefore, this study is designed to compare the effectiveness of these two methods in patients with chronic coccydynia. Ganglion impar radiofrequency ablation and phenol neurolysis are treatment options for patients who do not respond to medication, especially those experiencing only temporary or partial relief from an initial ganglion impar block.

In clinical practice, these two injection techniques are commonly employed in managing persistent pain in such cases. Phenol Neurolysis: This method aims to chemically destroy the nerves carrying pain signals from the coccyx area using phenol. The procedure is performed similarly to RFA: a radiofrequency needle is inserted through the disc between spinal bones under real-time imaging guidance to reach the ganglion impar. After confirming the needle position with contrast dye, a local anesthetic is administered, and then phenol is applied to chemically ablate the sensory fibers without pain. The study will include patients under the care of the Marmara University Pain Medicine Department who have not responded to medication and have received short-term or partial benefit from an initial ganglion impar block. These patients will be randomly assigned via computer software into two groups.

One group will undergo the radiofrequency ablation procedure described above, and the other group will receive phenol neurolysis. The patients will be followed for six months, and the effectiveness of these two widely used but yet-to-be-compared treatments will be evaluated.
