## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) workup and treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining AAA and establishing risk stratification. Then, I should verify screening indications and modalities. Next, I will review diagnostic confirmation and surveillance intervals. After that, I need to determine intervention thresholds by size, growth, and symptoms. Then, I will compare open versus endovascular repair and preoperative optimization. Finally, I should address special populations, postoperative surveillance, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline risk stratification. AAA is typically defined as a maximal infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter of 3.0 cm or greater, or a focal dilation of at least 50% of the normal segment, with prevalence around 2–8% in older adults and strong risk factors including age, male sex, smoking, and family history; women have lower prevalence but higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, which will matter for thresholds later [^116m3bjd] [^116Qwtsi] [^117PnjVq].

> Wait, let me verify screening recommendations before I overgeneralize. For men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked, one-time ultrasound screening is recommended with high-quality evidence of reduced AAA-related mortality and ruptures; for first-degree relatives of patients with AAA, screening is reasonable in the 65–75 range or older if healthy, and for women, evidence is mixed, with ACC/AHA suggesting screening in women ≥ 65 with family history or smoking history, whereas USPSTF cites insufficient evidence for routine screening in women smokers, so I should be cautious and individualize in that group [^1125Xvf3] [^112vXeQ5] [^116v4jpV] [^115XYJ8N].

> Hold on, I should verify the screening modality and performance. Ultrasound is the first-line test for screening and surveillance due to high sensitivity and specificity, safety, and cost-effectiveness; however, bowel gas or obesity can limit visualization in 1–3%, and CT or MRI may be needed when ultrasound is nondiagnostic or for detailed anatomic planning, so I need to ensure I don't jump straight to CT in asymptomatic patients without a clear indication [^116by2QD] [^112A2TBP] [^117WGSav].

> Next, I should review how to confirm the diagnosis and stage disease. If screening is positive or suspicion is high, confirm with ultrasound and document the maximal transverse diameter perpendicular to flow; if the patient is symptomatic or if rupture is suspected, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT angiography urgently to define anatomy and plan intervention, and I need to remember that CT often measures 1–2 mm larger than ultrasound, which can affect serial comparisons if modalities change [^115o8qC4] [^112NcosF] [^117WGSav].

> I will now examine surveillance intervals by size, and I should double-check the exact cadence. For 3.0–3.9 cm, every 3 years is reasonable; for 4.0–4.9 cm, annually; for 5.0–5.4 cm, every 6 months; and for ≥ 5.5 cm, expedited referral for repair is indicated, with ACC/AHA aligning to similar intervals and emphasizing more frequent surveillance as size approaches intervention thresholds; I initially thought SVS endorsed 6-month intervals for 4.5–4.9 cm, but wait, I should correct that — SVS places 6-month intervals at 5.0–5.4 cm, not 4.5–4.9 cm, so I need to ensure I document the size bands correctly [^115RjLC2] [^113QRckf] [^111SiSQH].

> Let me consider intervention thresholds next, and I should confirm sex-specific cutoffs. Elective repair is recommended at ≥ 5.5 cm in men and ≥ 5.0 cm in women, reflecting higher rupture risk in women at smaller diameters; rapid growth of ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1.0 cm in 1 year also lowers the threshold, and symptomatic or saccular aneurysms warrant earlier repair irrespective of size; I should also note that contemporary rupture risk estimates are lower than historical figures, but the size-based thresholds remain guideline-supported [^116wjm9H] [^1167YsmA] [^115i8Xf5] [^117PnjVq].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with pain or hemodynamic instability. In symptomatic unruptured AAA, admit to ICU, control blood pressure, and proceed to urgent repair within 24–48 hours when feasible; in ruptured AAA, immediate emergency repair is indicated, with a strong preference for EVAR when anatomically feasible given lower perioperative mortality, though I should confirm candidacy with appropriate imaging and institutional capabilities [^115y1Trg] [^116tvrp5] [^111MrDnL].

> I need to check the comparative merits of open repair versus EVAR and ensure I don't overstate long-term equivalence. EVAR offers lower perioperative mortality and faster recovery, but requires lifelong surveillance for endoleaks and has higher reintervention rates; open repair has higher upfront morbidity but durable fixation without the need for ongoing imaging; randomized data show similar long-term survival, so modality choice should be individualized to anatomy, age, comorbidity, and patient preference, ideally in a multidisciplinary setting [^115tGdML] [^115NVmM9].

> Next, I should review preoperative optimization and perioperative care. All patients should have cardiovascular risk assessment and, when indicated, preoperative cardiac evaluation; smoking cessation is essential; blood pressure should be optimized; and for elective cases, targeting repair within about 8 weeks of referral is reasonable to balance rupture risk against preparation time; I should also confirm that patients are counseled on procedural risks using validated tools like the VQI mortality calculator to support shared decision-making [^117CuJGr] [^114N5x6R] [^11456EY5].

> Let me think about special populations and nuances. Women have higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, so a 5.0 cm threshold is appropriate; patients with limited life expectancy may reasonably forego repair; saccular aneurysms carry higher rupture risk and warrant earlier intervention even when smaller; and patients with connective tissue disorders or rapid growth merit lower thresholds and expedited evaluation, so I should tailor decisions accordingly [^116wjm9H] [^117W6iFD] [^114pr16o].

> I should confirm postoperative surveillance after EVAR. Lifelong imaging is required, typically with contrast-enhanced CT at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months, then annually if stable; ultrasound can be substituted selectively when CT is contraindicated, but I need to ensure detection of endoleaks and sac behavior is reliable; type I and III endoleaks require prompt treatment, whereas type II endoleaks without sac expansion can be observed with close follow-up [^115tGdML] [^1179P9z8].

> Hold on, I should verify that my practical algorithm is coherent and reference-aligned. Screen high-risk patients with ultrasound; confirm and size with standardized measurements; surveil at 3-year intervals if 3.0–3.9 cm, annually if 4.0–4.9 cm, and every 6 months if 5.0–5.4 cm; refer for repair at ≥ 5.5 cm in men or ≥ 5.0 cm in women, or with rapid growth or symptoms; choose EVAR or open repair based on anatomy and patient factors; and ensure structured follow-up with patient education and shared decision-making throughout [^1125Xvf3] [^116wjm9H] [^115NVmM9].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating anything: ultrasound-first screening in the right populations reduces AAA mortality, size- and sex-specific thresholds guide timely repair, and modality selection plus rigorous surveillance after EVAR are the pillars of best practice; I need to ensure I communicate that most screen-detected AAAs are 3.0–5.5 cm and managed with surveillance, which explains why screening programs are effective without overtreatment [^112XJvTw] [^112q3vZr].

The workup for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) centers on **ultrasound for screening and surveillance** [^116by2QD] and **CT angiography for definitive sizing and surgical planning** [^112NcosF]. Treatment is guided by size, growth, and symptoms: **repair at ≥ 5.5 cm in men or ≥ 5.0 cm in women** [^116wjm9H], or if growth ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or symptoms occur [^1167YsmA]. EVAR is preferred when anatomy allows due to lower perioperative risk [^115tGdML], while open repair is reserved for unsuitable anatomy or failed EVAR [^116Ktkry]. Medical management focuses on **risk factor control** (blood pressure, lipids, smoking cessation) [^115tGdML] and surveillance for small aneurysms [^113QRckf]. Ruptured AAA requires **immediate emergency repair** [^111MrDnL], with EVAR favored when feasible [^116tvrp5].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Initial evaluation

- **History and risk assessment**: Age, sex, smoking, family history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease [^116Qwtsi].
- **Physical examination**: Palpation for a pulsatile abdominal mass; assess femoral and popliteal pulses for concomitant aneurysms [^116XbLSc].

---

### Imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | - Screening <br/> - Surveillance of small AAAs | - Non-invasive <br/> - High sensitivity/specificity <br/> - No radiation | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited by obesity/bowel gas [^117WGSav] |
| CT angiography (CTA) | - Definitive sizing <br/> - Anatomic assessment <br/> - Surgical planning | - High accuracy <br/> - Detailed anatomy <br/> - Rapid | - Radiation <br/> - Contrast nephrotoxicity [^notfound] |
| MRI | - Alternative to CTA when contrast contraindicated | - No radiation <br/> - Good soft-tissue detail | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time |

---

### Diagnostic criteria

An AAA is **defined as a maximal infrarenal aortic diameter ≥ 3.0 cm** or a focal dilation ≥ 50% of the normal segment [^116qyz9U]. Rupture risk rises with size: about 1% per year at 4.0–4.9 cm, 3–15% per year at 5.0–5.9 cm, and > 20% per year at ≥ 6.0 cm [^117PnjVq].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Medical management

Medical management emphasizes **blood pressure control** to a target < 140/90 mmHg (or < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated) [^notfound], statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction [^115tGdML], smoking cessation with supportive counseling and pharmacotherapy [^115tGdML], and surveillance with ultrasound at 3-year intervals for 3.0–3.9 cm, annually for 4.0–4.9 cm, and every 6 months for 5.0–5.4 cm [^113QRckf].

---

### Surgical intervention

#### Indications for repair

- **Size threshold**: ≥ 5.5 cm in men or ≥ 5.0 cm in women [^116wjm9H].
- **Rapid growth**: ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1.0 cm in 1 year [^1167YsmA].
- **Symptomatic AAA**: Pain or tenderness attributable to the aneurysm [^115y1Trg].
- **Saccular aneurysm**: Any size due to higher rupture risk [^notfound].

---

#### Surgical options

- **Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)**: Lower perioperative morbidity and mortality; preferred when anatomy is suitable [^115tGdML].
- **Open surgical repair**: Reserved for unsuitable anatomy, failed EVAR, or resource limitations [^notfound].
- **Emergency repair**: Immediate for ruptured AAA; EVAR preferred when feasible [^116tvrp5].

---

### Postoperative surveillance

After EVAR, obtain **imaging at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months**, then annually to detect endoleaks [^notfound]. After open repair, perform ultrasound or CT at 1 year and every 2–5 years thereafter.

---

## Special considerations

Women have a **lower size threshold for repair** (≥ 5.0 cm) due to higher rupture risk at smaller diameters [^116wjm9H]. Elderly patients require individualized decisions based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preference [^113UGTNb]. Patients with connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan, Loeys-Dietz) may require earlier intervention at smaller diameters due to higher rupture risk.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Screening**: Ultrasound for men ≥ 65 who have smoked or have a family history; consider in women ≥ 65 with risk factors [^1125Xvf3] [^112vXeQ5].
- **Surveillance**: Ultrasound intervals based on size and growth [^113QRckf].
- **Repair**: Size, growth, and symptom-guided; EVAR preferred when feasible [^116wjm9H] [^116tvrp5].
- **Medical management**: Risk factor control and lifestyle modification [^115tGdML].
- **Emergency**: Immediate repair for ruptured AAA; EVAR preferred when feasible [^111MrDnL] [^116tvrp5].

---

The management of AAA is **multidisciplinary**, integrating imaging, risk stratification, and individualized treatment to balance rupture risk against operative risk and patient preferences [^115NVmM9].

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm or AAA ("triple A") is one of the top 15 leading causes of death in the United States. In this condition, a weakened aortic wall can lead to progressive aortic diameter enlargement and, in some cases, rupture. Aortic rupture is highly morbid and lethal with a mortality rate of up to ~80%.

Risk factors for AAA (defined here as a maximal aortic diameter > 3.5 cm) include advanced age, male sex, smoking, family history of the condition, and hypertension –. AAA can be treated via open or endovascular repair. The mortality rate of the surgery can be just 2–3%. Surgery is indicated for AAAs > 5.5 cm or expanding at a rate > 1 cm/year. Since most AAAs are asymptomatic, screening and surveillance are essential –.

Ultrasound permits accurate and safe detection of AAAs with sensitivity/specificity of 94–100% –. Furthermore, guidelines (e.g. Society for Vascular Surgery) and programs (e.g. Medicare) are in place for one-time screening in specific populations (e.g. men above 65 yearsor men and women aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked,) and for surveillance (e.g. every 12–36 months for AAAs < 5 cm 3). However, ultrasound requires an expert operator, capital equipment, and costs ~$100 per scan. As a result, ultrasound is used in < 1–20% of those patients eligible for AAA screening, and AAA diagnosis is often made based on incidental findings when imaging for other reasons or at the time of rupture. About 1.3 years of life are lost for every 10 unscreened patients, which is similar to breast cancer screening. Ultrasound may be underutilized for AAA surveillance as well. The guidelines assume fixed AAA expansion rates, but AAAs can grow in spurts or even shrink over time. The guidelines and programs are also based on the argument that competing causes of death are significant at very old ages (e.g. > 80 years). However, this argument may become less tenable as society ages and the quality of healthcare advances.

Guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist patients and providers in choosing appropriate health care for specific clinical conditions. Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ≥ 5.5 cm. However, the recommendations regarding other age groups, imaging intervals for small AAAs, inclusion of women, and cost-effectiveness have not been universally adopted. As many countries are considering the initiation of an AAA screening program, this is an overview on the current status of such programs.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) symptomatic imaging — In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether an AAA is present and to evaluate for other causes; if an aneurysm is detected, the patient should have CT arteriography with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, and if hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves during evaluation, further imaging studies should be abandoned as care is escalated. We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric mass or significant risk factors for AAA, with Level of recommendation 1 (Strong) and Quality of evidence B (Moderate).

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred". In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU". For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter". Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter", while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter".

### Medical management… [^115tGdML]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Medical Management AAA can be managed medically or surgically, depending on the patient's symptoms and the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. The goal of medical management is to prevent AAA rupture and avoid invasive treatment by preventing aneurysm enlargement or reducing aneurysm size. Medical management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients and smaller aneurysms. Studies suggest that smoking has been associated with AAA, and self-reported current smokers have a faster growth rate than former smokers, approximately 0. 4 mm per year. 24 Therefore, smoking cessation should always be encouraged in patients with known AAA. 24, 27 There are no recommendations for direct interventions to reduce AAA expansion and the need for repair.

Administering beta blockers, such as propranolol, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, doxycycline, and roxithromycin for the purpose of reducing the risk of AAA expansion and rupture is not recommended. 29 Medical management of AAA predominantly involves cardiovascular risk reduction such as antihypertensive, statin, and antiplatelet therapy. 28, 31–33 Antihypertensive therapy should target the patient's blood pressure goal. A meta-analysis showed that statins are associated with attenuation of AAA growth by slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease. 34 Patients with AAA are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and most guidelines recommend the use of anti-platelet agents for secondary prevention, such as aspirin or clopidogrel for those intolerant of aspirin.

28, 31 A combination of statins and beta blockers is associated with a reduction of perioperative mortality and incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction for patients undergoing surgery for AAA. 35 AAA can be managed using two types of surgical approaches: open repair and EVAR. Surgical management is indicated when the aneurysm diameter is 5. 5 cm or larger for men and
5. 0 cm or larger for women. OPEN REPAIR Traditional open repairs are done by a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach based on the patient's anatomy and surgeon preference. 42 The Dutch Randomised Endovascular Aneurysm Management trial found that EVAR and open repair of AAA resulted in similar rates of survival. 31 Another randomized trial found that EVAR was associated with a lower risk of perioperative complications and death compared with open surgical repair, but the mortality was similar after two years.

Regarding medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to setting of care, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider referring asymptomatic patients with extensive aortic disease, patients likely to benefit from complex open and endovascular aortic repairs, and patients with multiple comorbidities eligible for an intervention to a high-volume center (performing at least 30–40 aortic procedures annually) with experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team to optimize treatment outcomes.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm — timing by presentation and status: The optimal timing of AAA repair is based on clinical presentation and aneurysm status: a ruptured AAA requires emergent repair; a symptomatic, nonruptured aneurysm is best treated urgently; and an asymptomatic AAA can be treated electively after completion of preoperative assessment. Delay in the treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA should be minimized.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment thresholds and indications — Most AAAs are fusiform rather than saccular, and treatment recommendations for asymptomatic fusiform AAA rest primarily on the maximum transverse diameter as measured on ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional arteriography can easily underestimate the true diameter by not accounting for luminal thrombus. There is general agreement that small aneurysms, < 4.0 cm in maximum diameter, are at low risk of rupture and should be monitored, whereas an aneurysm > 5.4 cm in diameter should be repaired in an otherwise healthy patient. Elective repair is also recommended for patients who present with a saccular aneurysm, and when an unrecognized AAA first presents symptomatically with abdominal or back pain or rupture, prompt treatment is recommended.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115ShLQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant vascular disease found in 4% to 8% of the screening population. If ruptured, its mortality rate is between 75% and 90%, and it accounts for up to 5% of sudden deaths in the United States. Therefore, screening of AAA while asymptomatic has been a crucial portion of preventive health care worldwide. Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta is the primary imaging modality for screening of AAA recommended for asymptomatic adults regardless of their family history or smoking history. Alternatively, duplex ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate for screening. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pulsatile abdominal mass, suspected abdominal aortic aneurysm: 2023 update [^116qyz9U]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as abnormal dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aortic diameter to 3.0 cm or greater. The natural history of AAA consists of progressive expansion and potential rupture. Although most AAAs are clinically silent, a pulsatile abdominal mass identified on physical examination may indicate the presence of an AAA. When an AAA is suspected, an imaging study is essential to confirm the diagnosis. This document reviews the relative appropriateness of various imaging procedures for the initial evaluation of suspected AAA.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^116Heht8]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — definition, epidemiology, rupture risk and intervention thresholds are summarized as follows: An aneurysm is defined as at least a 50% increase in local aortic diameter or > 30 mm absolute diameter, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are up to 4 times more common in men. In men, rupture risk per year ranges from 0.3% to 0.8%, and surveillance of AAA < 55 mm is supported; in women, the risk of rupture may be up to 4 times higher, justifying intervention at 50 mm. Growth usually occurs initially at a smaller diameter (< 42.5 mm), and in patients with high-risk AAA, earlier intervention may be reasonable. For symptomatic, unruptured AAA, urgent repair is indicated to reduce the risk of rupture, and for ruptured AAA, emergency surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPulsatile abdominal mass suspected abdominal aortic Aneurysm [^111EzSZk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical palpation of a pulsating abdominal mass alerts the clinician to the presence of a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Imaging studies are important in diagnosing and categorizing the extent of the aneurysm and may aid in treatment planning. The consensus of the literature supports the use of ultrasound as the initial screening test in patients with suspected AAA. Population-based ultrasound screening studies have been recommended and have proved effective for male patients > 65 years of age. For diagnosis and pre-intervention evaluation, either multidetector CT or CT angiography is the optimal choice for detailed characterization of the aneurysm. MR angiography may be substituted if CT cannot be performed (for example, because the patient is allergic to iodinated contrast material). Invasive angiography has little role in the diagnosis of AAA and PET and CT remain experimental in patients with suspected aneurysms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: recommendation… [^115tA7vZ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality. Larger size is associated with an increased risk of rupture. The annual risk for rupture is nearly 0% for persons with AAAs between 3. 0 and
3. 9 cm in diameter, 1% for those with AAAs between 4. 0 and
4. 9 cm in diameter, and 11% for those with AAAs between 5. 0 and
5. 9 cm in diameter. 1 Surgical repair is standard practice for men with an AAA of 5. 5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than
4. 0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size. Endovascular aneurysm repair has become the most common approach for elective AAA repair. Open repair is a time-tested, effective treatment for AAA. In the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using endovascular aneurysm repair.

3. 0 and 5.

5 cm in diameter and thus below the usual threshold for surgery. The current standard of care for patients with stable smaller aneurysms is to maintain ultrasound surveillance at regular intervals because the risk of rupture is small. Recommended surveillance intervals for monitoring the growth of small AAAs vary across guideline groups, and adherence with surveillance guidelines has been reported to be as low as 65%. 1 Repairing smaller aneurysms with a lower risk of rupture increases the harms and reduces the benefits of screening. 33 In women, small AAAs have an increased risk of rupture and rupture at an older age than in men. 1 Studies estimate that one-fourth to one-third of women have an AAA with a diameter below the current 5. 5-cm threshold at the time of rupture.

1. 1, 34 Women also experience higher rates of other harms, such as major surgical complications and hospital readmission, after elective open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair compared with men.

1 Current Practice. Evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women. The standard of care for elective repair is that patients with an AAA of 5. 5 cm or larger in diameter should be referred for surgical intervention with either open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair — We recommend repair for the patient who presents with an AAA and abdominal or back pain that is likely to be attributed to the aneurysm. We recommend elective repair for the patient at low or acceptable surgical risk with a fusiform AAA that is ≥ 5.5 cm. We suggest elective repair for the patient who presents with a saccular aneurysm. We suggest repair in women with AAA between 5.0 cm and 5.4 cm in maximum diameter. In patients with a small aneurysm (4.0–5.4 cm) who will require chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or solid organ transplantation, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about treatment options.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAbdominal aortic aneurysm follow-up (without repair) [^1115oNij]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta to 3 cm or greater. A high degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with AAA rupture, and imaging surveillance plays an essential role in mitigating the risk of rupture. Aneurysm size and growth rate are factors associated with the risk of rupture, thus surveillance imaging studies must be accurate and reproducible to characterize aneurysm size. Ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography provide an accurate and reproducible assessment of size, while radiographs and aortography provide limited evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Among patients with an aortic diameter between 3.0 and 3.4 cm, 21% had reached 5.5 cm at 3 years; and of those with a diameter between 3.5 and 3.9 cm, 10.5% exceeded 5.5 cm or required surgery within 2 years, with rupture occurring in 1.4%. Two randomized controlled trials and a follow-up study demonstrated that a policy of surveillance until aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm is safe and associated with a rupture rate of 1% per year.

### The emergency medicine approach to abdominal vascular graft complications [^113sXUBD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a deadly condition, particularly with rupture. Emergency physicians provide vital frontline care to the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become the gold standard for treatment of AAA, but the management of EVAR complications is not well discussed in the emergency medicine literature.

Objective Of This Review

The purpose of this article is to provide an emergency medicine-focused review of the complications of EVAR.

Discussion

Although many complications may arise after AAA repair, the most common include aortoenteric fistula, endoleak, limb ischemia, and graft infection. All potential complications should receive vascular surgery consultation and hemodynamic resuscitation. Aortoenteric fistula often presents nonspecifically with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is required for diagnosis. An endoleak is defined by vascular flow outside of the graft. The optimal diagnostic modality includes triple phase computed tomographic scan (noncontrast, arterial, delayed phase). Limb ischemia may occur before 2 months, or in a later period, with symptoms ranging from claudication to complete neurovascular compromise. Graft infection is most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus, and imaging can suggest the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue or fluid sampling. Through an understanding of these complications, emergency physicians may improve patient outcomes.

Conclusions

With the growing use of EVAR, emergency physician exposure to complications of this procedure is increasing. Knowledge of the complication presentations, diagnoses, and management can play an integral role patient care.

AAA treatment thresholds and rupture risk: Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality, and larger size is associated with increased rupture risk. The annual risk for rupture is "nearly 0%" for AAAs 3.0 to 3.9 cm, "1%" for 4.0 to 4.9 cm, and "11%" for 5.0 to 5.9 cm. Surgical repair is standard for "an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period)".

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms: which risk factors play a role in decision-making? [^115JD5FL]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

There are three choices for management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), ie, endovascular repair (EVAR), open repair (OR), and continuing surveillance (OBS). The treating physician must weigh the risk of no intervention, in terms of ultimate death from rupture, against the more immediate risk associated with either form of repair, considering in the process those risk factors that directly or indirectly relate to outcome. These risk factors include AAA size and the patient's comorbidities, age, gender, and AAA anatomy, as well as the skills and experience of the treating physicians and the health care environment in which the patient is treated. While individualization is clearly required, a generalizable platform for decision-making derived from past trials and other pertinent observational studies is also useful. This article attempts to present pertinent background information and develop it into generally applicable guidelines.

"Select patients < 65 years of age may be at increased risk of AAA rupture", but "in patients < 65 years, data are lacking on the mortality benefit of AAA screening". "Some patients may develop AAA after the age of 75 years even if they had an initial negative screen between the ages of 65 and 75 years", yet "data from cohort studies suggest long-term AAA-related mortality is low among patients with an initial negative screening ultrasound who had a subsequent AAA detected on repeat screening after the age of 75 years". For borderline enlargement with risk factors, selected low-surgical-risk patients "may be considered for repeat screening on an individualized basis".

### Guidelines for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. report of a subcommittee of the joint council of the American association for vascular surgery and Society for Vascular Surgery [^113UGTNb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Decision-making in regard to elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requires careful assessment of factors that influence rupture risk, operative mortality, and life expectancy. Individualized consideration of these factors in each patient is essential, and the role of patient preference is of increasing importance. It is not possible or appropriate to recommend a single threshold diameter for intervention which can be generalized to all patients. Based upon the best available current evidence, 5.5 cm is the best threshold for repair in an "average" patient. However, subsets of younger, good-risk patients or aneurysms at higher rupture risk may be identified in whom repair at smaller sizes is justified. Conversely, delay in repair until larger diameter may be best for older, higher-risk patients, especially if endovascular repair is not possible. Intervention at diameter < 5.5 cm appears indicated in women with AAA. If a patient has suitable anatomy, endovascular repair may be considered, and it is most advantageous for older, higher-risk patients or patients with a hostile abdomen or other technical factors that may complicate standard open repair. With endovascular repair, perioperative morbidity and recovery time are clearly reduced; however, there is a higher reintervention rate, increased surveillance burden, and a small but ongoing risk of AAA rupture. There is no justification at present for different indications for endovascular repair, such as earlier treatment of smaller AAA. Until long-term outcome of endoluminal repair is better defined and results of randomized trials available, the choice between endovascular and open repair will continue to rely heavily on patient preference.

### Arterial atherosclerosis: vascular surgery interventions… [^114cSBhC]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

13 After 12 weeks from the onset of symptoms or a stroke, the number needed to treat to prevent a stroke increases to 125. Carotid endarterectomy has a high short-term complication rate, with 7% of patients experiencing stroke or death within 30 days; 15% of patients experience stroke or death within five years of the procedure. 13 Stroke within 30 days of carotid endarterectomy dramatically increases mortality.
24. Transcarotid artery revascularization is a newer surgical approach for carotid stenosis. In transcarotid artery revascularization, carotid artery stents are placed by incising the affected artery. During the procedure, the carotid artery is clamped proximal to the stenosis, and the distal carotid flow is reversed using an extracorporeal circuit to the femoral vein. This protects the cerebral arteries while the backflow removes atherosclerotic debris released from the surgery.

28 ABI is less sensitive in patients with small vessel disease from atherosclerosis associated with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. The USPSTF and AAFP conclude that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with ABI in adults who are asymptomatic. 29, 30. CLI and acute limb ischemia are the strongest indications for revascularization. Revascularization is a treatment option for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication who do not respond to other guideline-directed therapies. Revascularization is not beneficial in patients with incidentally discovered PAD. 3 Surgical interventions, including bypass grafting, endarterectomy, and angioplasty with or without stenting, have similar outcomes based on limited evidence.

Endovascular revascularization is associated with fewer complications than bypass grafting; therefore, it may be more appropriate for patients with significant comorbidity and associated increased surgical risk.

Patients with unilateral stenosis, normal renal function, and abrupt onset or worsening of severe hypertension despite more than three antihypertensive medications are typically considered for intervention. Other possible indications for renal artery stenting include patients with bilateral stenosis and rapidly declining renal function and younger patients with fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the renal artery.

### Aortic emergencies [^112rhs7N]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Aortic emergencies present a diagnostic and treatment challenge for emergency physicians. Both acute aortic dissection and abdominal aortic aneurysms can be difficult to recognize, and a missed or delayed diagnosis may be fatal. A high clinical suspicion and rapid patient evaluation are important. Although many patients ultimately require surgical intervention, early and aggressive attention to hemodynamic stability by the emergency physician can provide a window to definitive treatment.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology and growth — risk features and thresholds are detailed, noting saccular AAAs are rare with limited natural history data, and in a Dutch registry 7,659 patients with AAA included 6.1% saccular AAA; among saccular aneurysms with acute presentation, 25% had diameters < 5.5 cm and 8.4% had diameters < 4.5 cm, whereas in fusiform AAA these were 8.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Pooled surveillance data show growth rates range from 1.5 mm/y to 2 mm/y for AAA of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm and from 3.3 mm/y to 5.7 mm/y for AAA of 4.0 cm to 5.9 cm at baseline; major early-treatment trials excluded aneurysms that grew ≥ 7 mm in 6 months or > 10 mm in 12 months. Accordingly, aneurysms with size increases of ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥ 1 cm in 1 year are considered rapidly growing and may warrant consideration of repair, and elective repair for patients presenting with saccular AAA is recommended by the Society for Vascular Surgery although specific size guidance is lacking.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nsvCC]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### A 66-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm: review of screening and treatment [^113J6FXy]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of death. Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to be asymptomatic until the time of rupture, which has a mortality rate of greater than 80%. Therefore, elective repair prior to rupture is preferred if life expectancy is reasonable and the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of repair. Mr F, a 66-year-old man with a 5.2-cm AAA, illustrates the issues surrounding monitoring and treating AAA. Risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking history, and a family history of AAA. Screening for AAA with ultrasound has been shown to prevent rupture, prevent AAA-related death, and be cost-effective. Risk factors for rupture include larger diameter, female sex, and smoking history. Endovascular repair has lower operative mortality and complications and has replaced standard open surgery in more than half of patients. However, long-term survival is similar after endovascular and open surgical repair. Those at risk of AAA who would benefit from repair should undergo screening.

There is variation in the management of small aneurysms in the United States today, with some surgeons moving forward with elective repair and others practice ongoing surveillance. Literature exists to suggest that small aneurysms are repaired at a higher rate than should be considered acceptable, and this represents a deviation from current standards of care. To best understand the optimal care of this patient population, this article aims to evaluate the current management of small aneurysms, review contemporary guidelines and the literature behind them, and assess the appropriateness of surgical management of small aneurysms.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) risk factors and growth — Strong risk factors include smoking history, older age, male sex, and family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and additional risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, white race, inherited vascular connective tissue disorder, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Lifetime risk for AAA is 8.2% in men and 10.5% in current smokers, and at least 10% to 25% of patients with AAA have a family member with the same condition. AAA growth is nonlinear, with a mean rate of 2.6 mm/y for AAA < 5.0 cm, may accelerate in the setting of smoking or a family history of AAA, and smoking may have a greater impact on growth in women than in men; ultrasound screening should be targeted toward those at the greatest risk for AAA and growth with the goal of preventing rupture and associated mortality.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk by size and evidence base — Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms ≤ 5 cm in maximum diameter, 3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for aneurysms ≥ 8 cm; multiple trials that are now > 2 decades old evaluating early repair for AAAs measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm found no survival benefit but an increased risk of subsequent reintervention; accordingly, a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA, women had higher rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related deaths than men with a mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture of 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men, and in women ASI (aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m²]) has been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening evidence and risk factors — In randomized trials of men ≥ 65 years of age, screening reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs: OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years, and a population-based study reported that two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Family history markedly elevates risk: among relatives of those with AAA, ultrasound screening has identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers, and the overall lifetime prevalence of AAA is estimated to be 32% in brothers of those with AAA. In women, smoking was associated with a 15-fold increased risk of AAA (relative risk, 15.0; 95% CI, 13.2–17.0) versus 7-fold among men (relative risk, 7.3). Table 15 lists strong risk factors (smoking history, older age, male sex, family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm) and additional risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, white race, inherited vascular connective tissue disorder, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease).

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116m3bjd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on abdominal aortic aneurysm:

- **Definition**: An AAA is a structural disease of the abdominal aorta characterized by a pathological, localized dilatation of > 30 mm or > 50% of the original aortic size.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple environmental factors (including smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and collagen diseases) and genetic factors can induce and accelerate degeneration of the layers of the aortic wall. An inflammatory response in the aortic vessel wall leads to destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia, loss of smooth muscle cells, thinning of the media, and neovascularization.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the overall prevalence of AAA is estimated at 2,200 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic and are detected as an incidental finding on diagnostic imaging performed for other purposes. AAAs can also present with abdominal pain or complications such as thrombosis, embolization and rupture.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with ruptured AAA is approximately 85–90%.

Aneurysm imaging modalities in asymptomatic patients — Ultrasound detects the presence of an AAA accurately, reproducibly, and efficiently, and sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, but in 1% to 3% of patients the aorta cannot be visualized because of bowel gas or obesity. Transabdominal ultrasound is ideal for screening and surveillance but insufficiently precise for procedural planning or more complex morphologic analyses. CT imaging is more reproducible than ultrasound, with > 90% of measurements within 2 mm of the initial reading, although both techniques suffer from a lack of standardization in determining the degree and rate of disease progression. An aneurysm measured by standard axial CT is generally > 2 mm larger in diameter than when measured by ultrasound, and CT cross-sectional measurements are not necessarily perpendicular to the aortic path, which presumably contributes to an overestimation of aneurysm size.
