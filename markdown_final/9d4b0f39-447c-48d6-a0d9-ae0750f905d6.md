## Question

How is tertiary syphilis diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how tertiary syphilis is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish clinical suspicion with history and examination. Then, I should verify the optimal serologic testing sequence and its limitations in late disease. Next, I will confirm how to handle discordant serology and when to repeat tests. After that, I need to check precise indications for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and how to interpret CSF findings. I will then consider HIV and other STI testing, followed by targeted organ-specific investigations. I should synthesize staging, confirm diagnostic criteria, and align treatment to CSF results while planning steroid prophylaxis for Jarisch-Herxheimer risk. Finally, I will highlight key pitfalls, correct any overstatements, and outline follow-up monitoring using guideline anchors from IUSTI 2021, CDC 2021, and BASHH 2024 [^114UmpCR] [^113G9qA9] [^114PJWe8].

> Let me first confirm how to build clinical suspicion through history and examination, because tertiary syphilis is protean and often remote from the index infection timeline. I need to obtain a detailed prior syphilis history, treatment adequacy, sexual exposures, comorbidities, and a symptom timeline, and then perform a meticulous exam for late manifestations: neurologic deficits or cognitive change, cardiovascular findings like aortic regurgitation or aneurysm, gummatous destructive lesions, ocular inflammation, and otologic symptoms, remembering that syphilis remains the "great imitator" and can mimic autoimmune and neoplastic disease, so I should not anchor prematurely [^114UmpCR] [^113freNP] [^1123L69P].

> Next, I should review the initial serologic strategy and its caveats in late disease. Wait, let me verify the sequence: with a reverse algorithm, start with a treponemal EIA/CIA that detects IgM/IgG, then reflex a quantitative non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL) on the same specimen to establish a baseline titer for monitoring, keeping in mind that in tertiary syphilis, non-treponemal test sensitivity is reduced, so a nonreactive RPR or VDRL does not exclude disease and must be interpreted with the clinical picture [^111mVdU3] [^115B3dvk] [^111DoAmU]. Hold on, I should verify test characteristics in low-prevalence settings: EIA/CIA specificity may be suboptimal, lowering PPV and necessitating confirmatory treponemal testing when used for screening [^114mWtrJ].

> I will now examine confirmatory serology and how to handle discordance. I need to confirm a positive screen with a different treponemal assay such as TPPA or TPHA and, to avoid lab error, obtain a second specimen when feasible, while also ensuring that if a non-treponemal test was not performed quantitatively, I repeat it quantitatively for accurate baseline and follow-up comparisons [^114cM4bv] [^111msfK7]. But wait, what if the treponemal test is positive and the non-treponemal test is negative? I should double-check by repeating both tests in about one month to exclude very early seroconversion or prozone issues unless the clinical evidence strongly supports late-stage disease, in which case clinical judgment takes precedence [^1175xqBw] [^111mVdU3].

> Next, I should review when CSF analysis is required, because this drives both diagnosis and therapy. I need to ensure I do a lumbar puncture for any neurologic, ocular, or auricular symptoms, regardless of syphilis stage, and I should consider CSF evaluation in tertiary syphilis with cardiovascular or gummatous manifestations to exclude concurrent neurosyphilis, particularly in scenarios with HIV coinfection and late disease with CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm³ or high RPR/VDRL titers, serologic treatment failure, or receipt of non-penicillin alternatives for late syphilis [^114UmpCR] [^116gKjft] [^112KRZZB] [^11666zWP]. Let me think about interpretation: lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and a reactive CSF-VDRL support neurosyphilis, noting CSF-VDRL is specific but not highly sensitive, so a negative test does not rule it out when clinical suspicion and CSF abnormalities are present [^113G9qA9] [^115B3dvk].

> I should confirm coinfection assessment now. Universal HIV testing is essential because HIV impacts the pretest probability of neurosyphilis and may influence decisions to pursue CSF in late disease, although the diagnostic and treatment algorithms otherwise remain largely the same, and I should screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia given shared risks, while avoiding premature conclusions solely based on HIV status [^115B3dvk] [^1169wuyn] [^11666zWP].

> Hold on, I need to check organ-specific investigations tailored to presentation. For suspected neurosyphilis, brain and spine MRI can delineate meningovascular changes or gummas; for cardiovascular syphilis, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography and CT angiography can evaluate aortitis or aneurysm; for suspected gummas, tissue biopsy with appropriate histopathology and ancillary stains can support the diagnosis; for ocular disease, urgent comprehensive ophthalmologic examination is necessary; and for otosyphilis, audiometry and vestibular testing aid characterization while I plan penicillin-based therapy [^115B3dvk] [^111LuBwz] [^111TYkKY].

> Now I will synthesize staging and final diagnosis. I should confirm at least one treponemal test with a second treponemal assay when used as a screen, consider the quantitative non-treponemal titer as a baseline for follow-up, align objective clinical findings with late complications consistent with tertiary involvement, correlate CSF abnormalities when neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms exist, and exclude primary or secondary stage features by careful history and exam, since laboratory results alone cannot stage syphilis [^114UmpCR] [^1127w5YA].

> Treatment selection should flow directly from the CSF findings and clinical involvement. With normal CSF and no neurologic, ocular, or otic disease, I should administer benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units intramuscularly as three doses of 2.4 million units at one-week intervals, whereas with abnormal CSF or symptomatic neurosyphilis, I should treat with IV aqueous penicillin G 18–24 million units per day for 10–14 days, ensuring infectious diseases input for persons with HIV and treating any CSF abnormalities with the neurosyphilis regimen regardless of CD4 count [^113G9qA9] [^1146r2CA] [^116TTuBg]. I need to ensure a quantitative non-treponemal baseline before therapy and plan serologic follow-up, recognizing there is no single test-of-cure and that serial RPR/VDRL trends at approximately 6 and 12 months are used to gauge response [^112dRLSz].

> Preventing severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions is important in neurological and cardiovascular involvement. I should confirm use of prednisolone 40–60 mg once daily for three days, starting 24 hours before antibiotics, to mitigate inflammatory complications during rapid treponemal killing, and I will warn patients about transient fever and symptom flares [^114PJWe8].

> Before I conclude, I want to highlight pitfalls and correct an overstatement. Always perform CSF analysis before initiating therapy, as treatment duration and modality depend fundamentally on CSF status. Wait, that's too strong; I need to correct myself because guidelines do not recommend CSF for all patients but rather mandate it for any neurologic, ocular, or auricular symptoms and advise consideration in select tertiary or high-risk scenarios, especially defined HIV-related or serologic criteria, while avoiding unnecessary LPs in early syphilis without neuro-ocular-otic signs [^114UmpCR] [^116gKjft] [^11666zWP]. I should not rely solely on non-treponemal titers in tertiary disease given low sensitivity and serofast states, I must retain a broad differential because tertiary syphilis can mimic granulomatous, malignant, or autoimmune conditions, and I should remember that although HIV coinfection may prompt a lower threshold for CSF in late disease, the core diagnostic and treatment pathways are otherwise unchanged [^111DoAmU] [^1123L69P] [^116RErWD] [^1169wuyn]. Finally, I need to ensure structured follow-up with quantitative RPR/VDRL at defined intervals to document an appropriate serologic response and to detect treatment failure early, adjusting management accordingly [^112dRLSz].

Tertiary syphilis diagnosis requires a **combination of clinical assessment and serologic testing** [^115B3dvk], with **CSF analysis when neurologic, ocular, or otic involvement is suspected** [^114UmpCR] [^112KRZZB] [^111LuBwz]. Serologic diagnosis uses a treponemal test (EIA/CIA/TPPA/TPHA) for screening [^114cM4bv], confirmed by a different treponemal test [^113yZW16], and a **quantitative non-treponemal test** (RPR/VDRL) for activity and monitoring [^111mVdU3]. CSF analysis is indicated for neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms [^114UmpCR], or for cardiovascular/gummatous disease [^112KRZZB], and includes CSF VDRL, cell count, protein, and glucose. Imaging (MRI, CT, echocardiography) and histopathology may be needed for atypical or organ-specific disease [^112dmXW2] [^115B3dvk]. Diagnosis is **confirmed by compatible clinical findings**, positive treponemal tests, and supportive non-treponemal titers, with CSF or tissue confirmation when indicated [^114cM4bv].

---

## Clinical assessment and staging

Tertiary syphilis is **assessed clinically** by identifying **gummatous lesions** [^113ZB6Lm], **cardiovascular involvement** (e.g. aortitis, aneurysms), and **neurosyphilis** (e.g. tabes dorsalis, general paresis) [^113freNP]. Staging is guided by clinical history and examination because laboratory results alone cannot determine the stage [^1127w5YA].

---

## Serologic testing

Serologic testing is **the cornerstone of tertiary syphilis diagnosis**, using treponemal assays (EIA, CIA, TPPA, TPHA) for screening with confirmation by a different treponemal test; treponemal tests typically remain positive for life and cannot distinguish active from past infection [^115B3dvk]. Non-treponemal tests (RPR, VDRL) provide quantitative assessment of disease activity and treatment response but have lower sensitivity in tertiary syphilis (47–64%) [^111DoAmU]. The testing algorithm screens with a treponemal test [^111mVdU3], confirms with a different treponemal assay [^114cM4bv], and then performs a quantitative non-treponemal test to assess activity [^114mWtrJ].

---

## Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

CSF analysis is indicated when **neurologic, ocular, or otic involvement** is suspected:

- **Indications**: Clinical evidence of neurological, ocular, or otic involvement [^114UmpCR] [^111LuBwz], or cardiovascular/gummatous disease [^112KRZZB].

- **CSF tests**: CSF VDRL (specific but less sensitive), cell count, protein, and glucose levels [^111mVdU3].

- **Interpretation**: Positive CSF VDRL, elevated protein, and pleocytosis support neurosyphilis diagnosis.

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are **essential for detecting organ-specific involvement** in tertiary syphilis [^112dmXW2]. MRI delineates neurologic involvement, gummatous lesions, and cardiovascular abnormalities; CT helps identify osseous and gummatous lesions and cardiovascular involvement; and echocardiography evaluates cardiovascular disease such as aortic aneurysms and valvular disease [^111CcEDA].

---

## Histopathological examination

Histopathological examination is **indicated for atypical presentations**, when serology is inconclusive, or when gummatous lesions are suspected [^115B3dvk]. Findings include granulomatous inflammation, necrosis, and the presence of Treponema pallidum organisms.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

The diagnosis of tertiary syphilis is confirmed by:

- **Clinical findings**: Compatible clinical findings (gummatous lesions, cardiovascular, or neurological involvement) [^113ZB6Lm].

- **Serologic tests**: Positive treponemal tests and supportive non-treponemal titers [^113yZW16].

- **CSF analysis**: Positive CSF VDRL or abnormal CSF findings when neurological involvement is suspected [^114UmpCR].

- **Histopathology**: Histopathological confirmation when indicated [^115kRHaF].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Diagnosing tertiary syphilis is challenging: **non-treponemal tests have lower sensitivity** in tertiary disease [^111DoAmU], and treponemal tests remain positive for life, complicating interpretation [^115kRHaF]. Clinical manifestations are diverse and can mimic other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis or delays [^112dmXW2]. Limited access to advanced diagnostic tools in resource-limited settings further hampers diagnosis [^116qo9jG].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to assess **treatment response** and detect **relapse or reinfection**:

- **Serologic monitoring**: Regular quantitative non-treponemal tests (RPR or VDRL) to assess treatment response [^112dRLSz].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular clinical evaluations to detect relapse or reinfection [^114cM4bv].

- **CSF monitoring**: Repeat CSF analysis if neurological involvement was present initially.

---

Tertiary syphilis diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical assessment, serologic testing, CSF analysis, imaging studies, and histopathological examination. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure **successful treatment** and prevent **complications**.

### A complex neurological presentation of syphilis [^111rbi2W]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a contagious sexually transmitted infection notable for its complex array of systemic presentations. It is caused by the spirochaete Treponema pallidum. Although once considered a largely historical condition in the UK, the recent rise in incidence makes syphilis increasingly relevant when considering unusual presentations in at-risk patients.

The disease has three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The tertiary stage is associated with a plethora of neurological features, ranging from psychosis to seizures, caused by the direct invasion of the spirochaete into the central nervous system. Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old man presenting with tonic-clonic seizures on a background of balance and visual problems. Following a normal examination and routine investigations, further serology confirmed a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. The patient was started on appropriate treatment and made an excellent clinical recovery.

### Syphilis [^116PtBTE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

In the last half of the 20th century, medicine made tremendous inroads against syphilis, chiefly owing to the introduction of penicillin and vigorous public health initiatives. Yet, the world continues to be burdened by this disease. Since 2000, overall rates of syphilis have risen in the U.S. and throughout the world. Furthermore, through its association with an increased risk of HIV infection, syphilis has acquired a new potential for morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to survey the latest knowledge about syphilis, including pathogenesis and host response, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods and, especially, treatment and follow-up.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend the recognition that chemiluminescence immunoassay and treponemal enzyme immunoassay have suboptimal specificity, resulting in a low positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations. It is advised to obtain additional reflex confirmatory testing by performing either the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test or the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test if chemiluminescence immunoassay or treponemal enzyme immunoassay tests are used.

### Primary and secondary syphilis — United States, 2005–2013 [^116YjxGs]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

After being on the verge of elimination in 2000 in the United States, syphilis cases have rebounded. Rates of primary and secondary syphilis continued to increase overall during 2005–2013, although rates stabilized during 2009–2010. However, rates have increased since 2011. Increases have occurred primarily among men, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM), who contributed the vast majority of male primary and secondary syphilis cases during 2009–2012.

The epidemiology of syphilis among men, including MSM, has shifted since 2009, with larger increases occurring among Hispanic and white men. Despite this increase, disparities in primary and secondary syphilis between black men and other racial/ethnic groups remain significant. Many barriers to contacting and treating sex partners exist, including delays in reporting cases to the health department, anonymous partners, physicians who rely on patients to notify their partners, and the observed tendency of MSM to notify a smaller proportion of their sex partners than do heterosexuals.

These analyses indicate that syphilis prevention measures for MSM of all races/ethnicities need to be strengthened throughout the United States. This could be accomplished by working with private health-care providers because a substantial number of primary and secondary syphilis cases among MSM are reported by private physicians. Furthermore, both private and public providers should be aware of the resurgence in syphilis. They should be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of syphilis, conduct risk assessments, and screen all sexually active individuals.

### State-specific rates of primary and secondary syphilis among men who have sex with men - United States, 2015 [^111wzBgk]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, these findings are consistent with previous reports that showed pronounced disparities in primary and secondary syphilis rates between MSM and men who have sex with women only. The use of state-specific MSM population sizes and primary and secondary syphilis case counts permits comparison of primary and secondary syphilis rates by state. Rates among MSM compared with men who have sex with women only were higher in every state, but state-specific data suggested that certain states might have a greater need for syphilis prevention.

Because MSM represent the majority of all primary and secondary syphilis cases, the success of syphilis prevention programs is contingent upon addressing the high rates of syphilis among MSM. It is important that both private and public health care providers:

- **Recognize the signs and symptoms of syphilis** and conduct a comprehensive sexual history.
- **Screen all sexually active MSM for syphilis at least annually** and provide timely treatment according to national sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines.

Part of this sexual history includes eliciting information on sexual practices and the sex of patients' sex partners.

### Pulmonary syphilis with a cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia: a case report [^111dfjam]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic disease that progresses in the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Pulmonary manifestations of syphilis are rare, and their histological features have not been well described.

- **Case presentation**: A 78-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a solitary nodular shadow in the right middle lung field on a chest radiograph. Five years prior, a rash appeared on both legs. He was tested for syphilis at a public health center, and the non-treponemal test result was negative. When he was approximately 35 years old, he had unspecified sexual intercourse. Chest computed tomography showed a 13-mm nodule with a cavity in S6 of the right lower lobe of the lung. Robot-assisted resection of the right lower lobe was performed because of suspected localized right lower lobe lung cancer. A cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia (CiOP) was observed, and immunohistochemistry identified Treponema pallidum inside the macrophages in the nodule cavity. The rapid plasma regain (RPR) value was negative, and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay was positive. The patient was diagnosed as having secondary syphilis with pulmonary involvement. Insidious progression of secondary syphilis may result in CiOP and a negative RPR test result.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of pulmonary syphilis with a histological pattern of CiOP. It may be asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose because the RPR test may be negative for a long period. When either non-treponemal or treponemal test results are positive, the possibility of pulmonary involvement should be considered.

### Syphilis [^115Fzjnt]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

- **Contact tracing management**: Contacts, defined as people who have had sex with a person diagnosed with infectious (early) syphilis within 90 days, should receive treatment with one dose of BPG even if their serology results are negative. Asymptomatic contacts who had sex with an infected person more than 90 days ago can defer treatment until their serology results are available, but only if follow-up is assured. Discussions about contact tracing should be non-stigmatizing and sensitive to patients' concerns about confidentiality. It is important to explain that contact tracing has significant benefits for both the individual and their contacts. It helps limit the ongoing transmission of a serious infection and prevent re-infection. Patients need help and support to notify contacts confidentially.

- **Article creation**: This article was created based on a review of international guidelines, expert opinion (local public health unit, STI clinic, and infectious disease department), and a review of Medline and CINAHL using the search term "syphilis". A manual review of the reference lists of identified articles was also undertaken.

- **Education into practice**: Do you consider syphilis as a differential diagnosis of genital lesions and rashes among sexually active patients? How would you approach a conversation about contact tracing with a young man recently diagnosed?

- **Patient involvement**: We reviewed the contents of this material with Max Ottawa, a local community-based organization that focuses on maximizing the health and wellness of gay, bisexual, and Two-Spirit men.

### Vital signs: Missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis - United States, 2022 [^114qBKBN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

Historically, syphilis screening and interventions have targeted individual risk factors. However, for many sexually active persons, their most significant risk factor is living in a community with high rates of syphilis. CDC guidelines recommend syphilis screening for sexually active persons in communities with high rates of syphilis; however, the threshold for a high rate is not defined. Currently, the Healthy People 2030 goal is to reduce the rate of primary and secondary syphilis cases among females aged 15–44 years to 4.6 per 100,000 population.

- **In counties with a rate that exceeds this goal**: Offering syphilis testing to sexually active females aged 15–44 years and their sex partners might help identify syphilis cases, prevent spread, support progress toward meeting the Healthy People 2030 goals, and reduce congenital syphilis. In 2021, 38% of U.S. counties, accounting for 72% of the U.S. population, had syphilis rates above the goal level.

Disparities in syphilis rates by race and ethnicity are not explained by differences in sexual behaviors; rather, they reflect access to sexual health care, differences in sexual networks, and persistent and systemic racism in medical care. Screening based on geographic risk can decrease stigma and biases associated with screening based on individual risk factors. In counties already at or below the Healthy People 2030 goal level, clinicians should continue to assess individual risk factors (e.g. diagnosis of other sexually transmitted infections, a new partner).

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1176Pd2r]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with presumed latent ocular syphilis and congenital ocular syphilis at a tertiary referral center in Turkey, and to compare the clinical findings with patients described in other studies, specifically focusing on demographics and co-infections.

This retrospective study reviews the medical records of patients diagnosed with ocular inflammation between January 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed based on non-treponemal and treponemal antibody tests, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. All the patients diagnosed with ocular syphilis were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes.

A total of 1,115 patients were evaluated between January 2012 and June 2014, and 12 patients (1.07%) were diagnosed with ocular syphilis based on the inclusion criteria. None of the patients were seropositive for HIV. Two patients were seropositive for T. gondii-specific IgG. Clinical presentations include non-necrotizing anterior scleritis, non-necrotizing sclerokeratitis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis. All of the patients showed clinical improvement in the level of ocular inflammation with intravenous penicillin 24 million U/day for 10 days. Three patients received additional oral methotrexate as an adjunctive therapy. Two cases received low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Ocular syphilis is an uncommon cause of ocular inflammation, but the study highlights its varied clinical manifestations and positive response to appropriate antibiotic therapy.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^114Lrg6d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a re-emerging infectious disease with various systemic manifestations, including ocular involvement, which can lead to significant morbidity if untreated. This study aims to analyze the ocular manifestations of syphilis in patients treated at a Portuguese tertiary center over a 14-year period.

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with syphilis who presented with ocular symptoms from 2010 to 2023 was conducted. Data collected included demographic information, clinical presentation, ophthalmologic findings, serologic test results, treatment regimens, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 47 patients with ocular syphilis were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 45, with a male predominance of 78.7%. The most common ocular manifestations included uveitis (mostly posterior and panuveitis), optic neuritis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, and vitritis. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was highly variable, ranging from hand movements to no impairment of visual acuity. At the end of the follow-up period, the majority of the study eyes achieved a BCVA between 0 and 0.1 (p < 0.000). Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis was associated with poorer visual outcomes after treatment, indicating its presence is a poor prognosis factor. HIV status, the presence of vitritis, vasculitis, and papillitis at presentation, a positive syphilis serology in cerebrospinal fluid, and treatment regimen did not appear to have a significant impact on the final BCVA.

- **Conclusion**: Ocular syphilis, though rare, is a significant manifestation that requires early detection and timely management to prevent severe visual impairment. The findings highlight the need for increased clinical vigilance and comprehensive ophthalmic assessments in patients with syphilis.

### Syphilis [^112XFLft]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Incidence rates of syphilis have increased substantially around the world, mostly affecting men who have sex with men and people infected with HIV. Have a high index of suspicion for syphilis in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or rashes. Primary syphilis classically presents as a single, painless, indurated genital ulcer (chancre), but this presentation is only 31% sensitive; lesions can be painful, multiple, and extra-genital. Diagnosis is usually based on serology, using a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Syphilis remains sensitive to benzathine penicillin G. Staging syphilis is important because it is the basis of management (treatment, expected treatment response, follow-up periods, and partner follow-up). Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia.

Caused by the bacteria *Treponema pallidum*, syphilis is transmitted through direct (usually sexual) contact with infected mucosal lesions. Other bodily fluids are also infectious when patients are bacteraemic. With infectivity up to 10–30% per sexual contact or 60% per relationship, syphilis rates have risen 300% since 2000 in many Western countries. While most infections involve men who have sex with men, infections among people with opposite sex partners also occur. In addition to increasing rates, syphilis can cause early complications such as irreversible loss of vision, so awareness of the infection is important for primary care clinicians.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113G9qA9]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of syphilis, particularly concerning antibiotic therapy, the 2021 CDC guidelines recommend administering benzathine penicillin G 7,200,000 units intramuscularly. This should be given as three doses of 2,400,000 units at one-week intervals for adult patients with tertiary syphilis and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

### Tertiary syphilis and Kaposi sarcoma mistaken for systemic sarcoidosis in an HIV-negative patient [^116RErWD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

We describe a case of an HIV-negative man who was mistakenly diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis, which led to a delay in diagnosing tertiary syphilis and Kaposi sarcoma (KS). The patient initially presented with scrotal swelling and leg oedema. Initial blood tests were unremarkable, and HIV testing was negative. The patient then developed unilateral limb weakness. Computed tomography showed lung lesions and hilar lymphadenopathy, while magnetic resonance imaging showed an increased signal in the cervical cord. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was raised, and a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made, leading to the patient being started on steroids. Subsequently, his clinical symptoms and radiological abnormalities improved. However, he then developed progressive neurological deficits over several weeks, together with uveitis and cutaneous lesions.

A uveitis screen showed a raised venereal disease research laboratory test titre, prompting a reconsideration of the cause of his multisystemic symptoms. He was diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and treated with antibiotics. Dermatologists reviewed the skin lesions and diagnosed KS, which was confirmed with biopsies. The patient's neurological deficit remains. Syphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with neurological problems, skin lesions, or symptoms affecting multiple systems. Co-existing KS presented an extra therapeutic challenge in this case.

Syphilis is a re-emerging infectious disease with various systemic manifestations, including ocular involvement, which can lead to significant morbidity if untreated. This study aims to analyze the ocular manifestations of syphilis in patients treated at a Portuguese tertiary center over a 14-year period.

- **Patients and methods**: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with syphilis who presented with ocular symptoms from 2010 to 2023 was conducted. Data collected included demographic information, clinical presentation, ophthalmologic findings, serologic test results, treatment regimens, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 47 patients with ocular syphilis were identified. The mean age of the cohort was 45, with a male predominance of 78.7%. The most common ocular manifestations included uveitis (mostly posterior and panuveitis), optic neuritis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, and vitritis. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was highly variable, ranging from hand movements to no impairment of visual acuity. At the end of the follow-up period, the majority of the study eyes achieved a BCVA between 0 and 0.1 (p < 0.000). Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis was associated with poorer visual outcomes after treatment, indicating its presence is a poor prognosis factor. HIV status, the presence of vitritis, vasculitis, and papillitis at presentation, a positive syphilis serology in cerebrospinal fluid, and treatment regimen did not appear to have a significant impact on the final BCVA.

- **Conclusion**: Ocular syphilis, though rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with ocular symptoms, especially in those with risk factors such as HIV infection or a history of sexually transmitted infections.

### An unusual case of tertiary syphilis [^113X3LZE]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of tertiary syphilis in a middle-aged man who presented with a 6-month history of ulceration of his left eye with extreme pain. Physical examination revealed fistulas, granuloma with an ulcer, and corneal opacity with granulomatous conjunctivitis in the left eye. Based on the patient's clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results, neurosyphilis was diagnosed.

### Is it time to test and treat for syphilis [^111fRK8s]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Recent advances in the availability of accurate, 10–15-minute point-of-care syphilis tests have created an opportunity for reconsidering our approach to syphilis. Traditionally, many clinicians have been trained that the diagnosis of syphilis requires the use of both a laboratory-based treponemal and a nontreponemal antibody test for the confirmation and staging of infection. Such an algorithm is often associated with a delay in or lack of treatment due to loss to follow-up. Treatment at the time of a positive test result, a "test and treat" strategy, could be highly effective and decrease transmission.

In January 2024, the National Syphilis Task Force issued considerations for the use of rapid point-of-care syphilis tests, including the suggestion for immediate testing and treatment, but clinical uptake continues to be limited. Patients that could benefit most from this strategy include those with challenges accessing medical care and those at higher risk for loss to follow-up for treatment, such as pregnant women, youth, sex workers, and people experiencing homelessness.

In regard to diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a reflex treponemal test on the same serum in patients who tested positive on a non-treponemal test used alone for primary screening. If a quantitative non-treponemal test was not initially obtained, it is advised to repeat the non-treponemal test quantitatively.

### Syphilis in the modern era: An update for physicians [^111CcEDA]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a complex, systemic disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is most commonly transmitted sexually or congenitally and can involve nearly every organ system. Its clinical progression involves several well-characterized stages: an incubation period, a primary stage, a secondary stage, a latent stage, and a late or tertiary stage. Syphilis during pregnancy is a leading cause of perinatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, or congenital syphilis. Penicillin is highly effective against syphilis and remains the treatment of choice.

This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, treatment, and prevention of syphilis.

### Update on syphilis diagnostics [^111n651Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is rising globally, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, particularly among underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis using accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays are crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides an overview of laboratory methods for diagnosing syphilis, with a focus on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research.

- **Recent findings**: Syphilis can be complex and time-consuming to diagnose and stage appropriately. The historic use of darkfield microscopy for diagnosis has been eclipsed by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active Treponema pallidum infection. Newer diagnostic modalities, such as nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), hold promise for increasing identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More work is needed to develop accurate, reliable, affordable, and expeditious tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain the standard of care for syphilis diagnosis, but recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to increase syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve upon these testing modalities and explore other markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

### Evaluation of Elecsys syphilis assay for routine and blood screening and detection of early infection [^115zAqKn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Although it is typically considered a historic infection, the incidence of syphilis is increasing. In 2008, approximately 11 million new cases of infection were reported worldwide; from 2005 to 2013, the numbers of primary and secondary syphilis cases per year reported in the United States almost doubled, and the annual rate increased from 2.9 to 5.3 cases per 100,000 population. In high-income countries, infection rates are specifically increasing among men who have sex with men, and high rates of HIV coinfection have also been documented. This reemergence warrants renewed attention to the strategies used for the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis.

In order to treat syphilis and prevent its transmission, testing is a common component of prenatal, blood donor, organ donor, and STI screening. There are many diagnostic tests for syphilis available; however, a commonly accepted standard method is still lacking, and the algorithms used for initial screening and confirmation vary between countries. Treponema pallidum cannot be cultured in vitro, and direct swabbing and testing of a primary lesion for syphilis are often not possible, as primary lesions are apparent only for a short time and, depending on the location, may go unnoticed by the patient. As a result, the diagnosis of syphilis is usually based on serological methods and typically uses either a treponemal or nontreponemal test for primary screening. The result is subsequently confirmed by retesting, for example with an alternative treponemal test and a quantitative nontreponemal test. However, this is dependent on the diagnostic algorithm.

### Primary and secondary syphilis — United States, 2005–2013 [^114juU1p]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Public health officials should seek to improve the quality of data regarding the sex of sex partners, share local MSM, sexually transmitted disease, and HIV data consistent with local laws and regulations with medical providers to increase their awareness of disease burden in their communities, and ensure that providers can recognize syphilis symptoms. Two CDC cooperative agreements are encouraging local and state participants to make MSM a priority population and direct resources to areas of greatest need based on local epidemiology. The CDC, in collaboration with state and local partners, health-care providers, and MSM-oriented organizations, is also engaged in research to better understand risk factors for syphilis among MSM, develop improved care models to better reach and serve MSM populations, assess whether MSM are being tested and treated appropriately, and determine what barriers exist in the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis among MSM.

The continued decline of primary and secondary syphilis rates among black women since 2008 is encouraging and might suggest that targeted efforts to reduce syphilis among certain populations have had some success. Although primary and secondary syphilis is currently a predominantly MSM epidemic, it is important that efforts to prevent syphilis among heterosexual men and women continue, especially given the severe consequences of syphilis infection acquired in utero, including stillbirths.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, primary and secondary syphilis case-report data likely underestimate t.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^115KArsJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, ocular syphilis, though rare, remains a significant cause of visual morbidity. Diagnosing syphilis-related ocular manifestations poses challenges due to its varied clinical presentations. Clinicians must maintain a high suspicion for ocular syphilis in HIV-positive patients presenting with uveitis. Early diagnosis, supported by detailed clinical history and specific ocular findings, is crucial for preventing permanent vision loss despite occasional negative serological tests.

Research into vaccines for syphilis is ongoing but lacks a viable candidate in the near term. Recent studies suggest the potential for biomedical prevention using doxycycline: a daily dose reduced syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia infections by 73% in HIV-infected men. While routine use of doxycycline is not recommended yet, it may become a key preventive strategy.

Strategies to combat syphilis should include awareness and health education campaigns, promotion of condom use, and screening and treatment programs for STIs (sexually transmitted infections) in health centers and hospitals.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1161BCYT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with presumed latent ocular syphilis and congenital ocular syphilis at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. It compares the clinical findings with patients described in other studies, specifically focusing on demographics and co-infections.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study reviewing the medical records of patients diagnosed with ocular inflammation between January 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed based on non-treponemal and treponemal antibody tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. All the patients diagnosed with ocular syphilis were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes.

- **Results**: A total of 1,115 patients were evaluated between January 2012 and June 2014, and 12 patients (1.07%) were diagnosed with ocular syphilis based on the inclusion criteria. None of the patients were seropositive for HIV. Two patients were seropositive for T. gondii-specific IgG. Clinical presentations included non-necrotizing anterior scleritis, non-necrotizing sclerokeratitis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis. All of the patients showed clinical improvement in the level of ocular inflammation with intravenous penicillin 24 million U/day for 10 days. Three patients received additional oral methotrexate as adjunctive therapy. Two cases received low-dose trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.

- **Conclusion**: Ocular syphilis is an uncommon cause of ocular inflammation, but when present, it responds well to treatment.

### Screening for syphilis: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1171hMYF]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for syphilis infection is currently recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with previous syphilis infection, an infected sexual partner, HIV infection, or more than four sex partners in the preceding year.

- **Objective**: To update a 2004 systematic review of studies on syphilis screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through October 2015 and Ovid MEDLINE (January 2004 to October 2015), with an updated search through March 2016.

- **Study selection**: English-language trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms in nonpregnant adults and adolescents.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and two investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Transmission of disease, including HIV; complications of syphilis; diagnostic accuracy; and harms of screening.

- **Results**: No evidence was identified regarding the effectiveness of screening on clinical outcomes, the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments, the harms of screening, or the effectiveness of screening in average-risk, nonpregnant adolescents or adults or high-risk individuals other than men who have sex with men (MSM) or men who are HIV positive. Four non-US studies indicated higher rates of syphilis detection with screening every 3 months vs 6 or 12 months.

### Cipro [^113jL42R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Interference with timely diagnosis of syphilis**: Cipro has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. It is recommended to perform a serologic test for syphilis in all patients with gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis and conduct a follow-up serologic test for syphilis three months after Cipro treatment.

- **Crystalluria**: Crystals of ciprofloxacin have been rarely observed in the urine of human subjects but more frequently in the urine of laboratory animals, which is usually alkaline [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Crystalluria related to Cipro has been reported only rarely in humans because human urine is usually acidic. It is advised to avoid alkalinity of the urine in patients receiving Cipro and to hydrate patients well to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Blood glucose disturbances**: Fluoroquinolones, including Cipro, have been associated with disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with Cipro, it is crucial to discontinue Cipro and initiate appropriate therapy immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].

### Molecular and direct detection tests for Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum: A review of the literature, 1964–2017 [^115kRHaF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The number of primary and secondary cases of syphilis caused by infection with Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (herein T. pallidum) has steadily increased in the United States since the early 2000s. This has resulted in a nearly 73% increase in the overall number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2017 compared to 2013, and is apparent across sexual behaviors, ethnicities, and gender, leading to a more than 40% increase in congenital syphilis cases over the past year.

In the absence of treatment, syphilis can progress through multiple stages and present with a variety of clinical manifestations, collectively making laboratory testing, alongside a careful clinical evaluation, invaluable for establishing the diagnosis. However, diagnostic testing for syphilis can be challenging, as the organism cannot be grown in routine cultures and there is no single assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify all stages of the disease.

Currently, diagnosis remains primarily dependent on serologic evaluation for antibodies to T. pallidum using both treponemal and nontreponemal assays, via either a traditional or reverse algorithmic approach. Although serologic testing is associated with high sensitivity (> 95%) during secondary and later stages of the disease, the ability of these assays to detect cases of primary infection is significantly diminished, with studies suggesting that 14% to 46% of patients with primary syphilis may be seronegative, depending on the method used. Additional limitations of serologic testing include…

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. Recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines include assessing the treatment of syphilis using conversion to non-reactive RPR as an indicator of successful treatment outcomes.

### Detection of Treponema pallidum DNA for diagnosis, resistance identification, and treatment outcome prediction in early syphilis among men who have sex with men [^115zq1aN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

We investigated the use of Treponema pallidum DNA (TP-DNA) for diagnosis, resistance identification, and treatment outcome prediction in early syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM).

- **Methods**: MSM seeking care for sexually transmitted infections were prospectively enrolled from September 2021 to August 2024. Oral rinse, rectal swab, and urethral swab samples were tested for TP-DNA. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) to macrolides and tetracyclines were identified. Treatment responses were compared between syphilis cases with detected TP-DNA and those without.

- **Results**: Of 656 MSM enrolled, TP-DNA was most frequently detected in oral rinse samples (37.8% [193/510]), followed by rectal swab (20.2% [103/510]) and urethral swab samples (11.6% [59/510]) in clinic visits for early syphilis. TP-DNA was detected in 45.7% (233/510) of early syphilis cases and 0.7% (1/141) of cases without syphilis, resulting in a specificity of 99.3% (95% CI: 96.1–100%) and sensitivity of 45.7% (95% CI: 41.3–50.1%). Secondary syphilis cases had the highest yield of TP-DNA detection (67.6% [117/173]), followed by primary (48.7% [19/39]) and early latent syphilis cases (32.6% [97/298]). The Ct values of T. pallidum PCR in oral rinse samples were significantly lower in cases of higher rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titres (p < 0.001). The rate of T. pallidum harbouring RAMs to macrolides was 58.9% (139/236), increasing over 6-month intervals, from 32.4% (12/37) in 2021 to 77.8% (21/27) in 2023. Cases of detected TP-DNA had greater serological responses to treatments than those without.

### Contemporary clinical management of otosyphilis for practicing otolaryngologists-a scoping review [^111TYkKY]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic marked the resurgence of an old disease, syphilis. The CDC reported increased syphilis cases in the United States from 2016 to 2022, necessitating early recognition of syphilis to properly diagnose complications. We revisit otosyphilis management with the intent of developing an updated diagnostic testing algorithm and treatment plan for otolaryngologists to prevent worsening hearing loss.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases.

- **Methods**: A scoping review of diagnostic and treatment methods for otosyphilis was completed and reported in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-ScR extension for scoping reviews statement. A retrospective case series was also conducted by reviewing patient charts from a tertiary care hospital network. Patients with otosyphilis or neurosyphilis with otic symptoms, as diagnosed by an otolaryngology or infectious disease specialist, were included.

- **Results**: In 57 studies (222 patients), the mean reported symptom duration was 6.6 ± 5.0 weeks (n = 30) with nine outliers presenting after 6 months. Sixty-five percent had hearing loss, 43% tinnitus, and 24% vertigo. Most (97%) received penicillin. Of 84 with outcomes, 48 (57%) improved. In 18 additional patients from the tertiary hospital system cohort (17 males, 1 female; 25–87 years, 9 HIV-positive), penicillin or doxycycline was used. Six patients fully recovered, four required further therapy, two partially recovered, and one did not improve.

Otosyphilis has an insidious presentation and can mimic other audio disorders.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, specifically in relation to confirmatory testing, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend repeating the non-treponemal test quantitatively if it was not initially done. This is necessary in patients with positive or discrepant results when both a treponemal test and a non-treponemal test are used for primary screening tests. Such tests include enzyme immunoassay/ELISA, chemiluminescence immunoassay, the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test, the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test, as well as the VDRL and RPR tests.

### Is it time to test and treat for syphilis [^113Q2hBe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Syphilis presents a wide range of clinical symptoms depending on its stage. Severe complications of syphilis include neurosyphilis, cardiovascular syphilis, and congenital syphilis. Additionally, syphilis increases the likelihood of HIV acquisition and transmission, which is a particular concern among certain at-risk groups.

Syphilis continues to be a significant public health issue. Despite calls from the World Health Organization to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis globally, the number of syphilis cases has increased over the last decade. In the United States, reported cases of syphilis grew from 115,000 cases in 2018 to more than 209,000 cases in 2023, including 3,882 cases of congenital syphilis, marking a 50-year high. There is a pressing need for new approaches to address this ongoing crisis.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed the STI National Strategic Plan to reverse the recent rise in STIs in the United States. The goals of the plan are to prevent new infections, improve health outcomes by reducing adverse STI effects, accelerate progress in STI research, technology, and innovation, reduce STI-related health disparities and health inequities, and achieve integrated, coordinated efforts to address the STI epidemic. Specific priority populations include adolescents and young adults, men who have sex with men, and pregnant women.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of home testing, there is increased public awareness of rapid, point-of-care, lateral flow assays in general.

### Syphilis in children [^112WApK2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is transmitted both sexually and transplacentally. Untreated syphilis is a progressive disease that may result in death or disability in children and adults. Syphilis diagnosis requires two-stage serologic testing for nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies. Congenital syphilis diagnosis requires careful review of maternal testing and treatment, comparison of maternal and neonatal nontreponemal antibody titers, and clinical evaluation of the neonate.

In this review, we present the epidemiology of syphilis and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of syphilis as they relate to pediatric practice. Specifically, we address congenital syphilis and acquired syphilis in adolescents and pregnant women.

### A patient with secondary syphilis following incomplete treatment of primary infection [^1162ciXw]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum and is primarily transmitted via skin-to-skin or mucosal contact during sexual encounters, or through vertical transmission during pregnancy. Cases continue to rise globally across various demographic groups despite effective treatment and prevention interventions. We discuss the case of a 28-year-old cisgender man who presented with secondary syphilis one month after being inadequately treated for primary syphilis. Individuals can present with symptoms and signs of syphilis to clinicians of various subspecialties due to its diverse clinical presentation. All health-care providers should be able to identify the common and less common manifestations of this infection, as adequate treatment and follow-up are crucial to preventing serious sequelae. Novel biomedical prevention interventions, such as doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis, are on the horizon.

### Characteristics of syphilitic uveitis in northern China [^111YxCuz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

This study describes the characteristics of patients with syphilitic uveitis in northern China.

- **Methods**: A case series of 21 patients (33 eyes) diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary center in northern China was retrospectively analyzed.

- **Results**: Twenty-one patients (33 eyes) were diagnosed with syphilitic uveitis. Posterior segment involvement was found in 32 eyes (97.0%). Vitreous haze, neuroretinitis, and posterior placoid chorioretinitis were mainly found in patients with a relatively short duration of the disease, while diffuse chorioretinitis, pseudoretinitis pigmentosa, cystoid macular edema, and epiretinal membrane were found in patients with a relatively long duration of ocular involvement. A low best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.022) and a delay of syphilis treatment (P < 0.001) were associated with a significantly worse visual outcome.

- **Conclusions**: Syphilitic uveitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of any form of posterior ocular inflammation. The pattern of ocular involvement may change with the disease progression.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: Laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention [^115B3dvk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients, along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization.

### Syphilis: An unusual manifestation [^112xRDG2]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a widely investigated infectious venereal disease with varied presentations frequently mimicking other diseases. It progresses in distinct, well-characterized stages: early (primary and secondary), latent, and late (tertiary), each stage having its own unique presentations. However, there has been increasing evidence of atypical presentations. We describe one such presentation of early syphilis in its secondary stage. A man in his late 20s presented with a rash (which is typical of the secondary stage) and with bone pain with multiple lytic lesions (which is rare in the secondary stage but more typical of the tertiary stage). The patient was successfully treated for secondary syphilis. Based on our case and analysis of other case reports and research of early-stage syphilitic bone involvement, we conclude that the true incidence of bone involvement in early-stage syphilis may be higher than has been previously appreciated, and thus may be under-recognized and underdiagnosed.

### Syphilis [^112dmXW2]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum that is endemic in low-income countries and occurs at lower rates in middle-income and high-income countries. The disease is of both individual and public health importance; in addition to its direct morbidity, it increases the risk of HIV infection and can cause lifelong morbidity in children born to infected mothers. Without treatment, the disease can progress over years through a series of clinical stages, leading to irreversible neurological or cardiovascular complications.

Although syphilis is an ancient disease and the principles of recommended management have been established for decades, diagnosis and management are often challenging due to its varied manifestations and the difficulty in interpreting serological tests used to confirm diagnosis and evaluate response to therapy.

In North America and Western Europe, the incidence of syphilis has increased dramatically in the past decade among men who have sex with men, particularly those with coexistent HIV infection. Only one drug, penicillin, is recommended for syphilis treatment, and response to therapy is assessed based on changes over months in serological test titres. Treatment for patients who cannot receive penicillin and management of patients who do not serologically respond to treatment are common clinical problems.

### Syphilis: A great imitator [^1123L69P]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the control, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis, its recognition is often misunderstood or not considered by dermatologists and other physicians. This is particularly true for those who have little specialized training in the details of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or whose dermatologic practice is only occasionally consulted by individuals from communities where STIs are prevalent. Our aim is to highlight contemporary ideas and findings on syphilis so that accurate diagnosis and treatment are not just achieved, but also essential measures are undertaken. These include counseling to exclude other STIs, preventing reinfection, partner notification, and incorporating public health epidemiology, as would be done for any other infectious disease. For syphilis, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, not only is the biomedical aspect important, but also the social and psychological components.

### Vital signs: Missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis - United States, 2022 [^116aeAAn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

In a time when perinatal infections such as HIV and hepatitis B are declining in the United States, cases of congenital syphilis, a disease resulting from perinatal transmission of syphilis, have been increasing substantially. During 2012–2021, the number of reported congenital syphilis cases increased by 755%, from 335 in 2012 to 2,865 in 2021. Congenital syphilis can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage, or neonatal death. Surviving infants who are not adequately treated might develop blindness, deafness, developmental delay, or skeletal abnormalities. This condition is preventable through timely testing and adequate treatment of syphilis during pregnancy.

Increases in congenital syphilis mirror trends observed in rates of primary and secondary syphilis cases in women of reproductive age, which increased by 676% (from 2.1 to 16.3 per 100,000 population) during 2012–2021. Racial and geographic disparities in rates of congenital syphilis and rates of syphilis among women exist. To reduce perinatal transmission, CDC recommends screening for syphilis during pregnancy at the first prenatal care visit. Where access to prenatal care is not optimal, screening and treatment (if indicated) should be performed as soon as pregnancy is identified. CDC recommends screening at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for those who 1) live in communities with high rates of syphilis, 2) are at high risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g. substance use or a new sex partner), or 3) were not previously tested during the pregnancy.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for syphilis, more specifically with respect to CSF analysis, the IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining CSF assessment in asymptomatic patients in the following situations for the exclusion of asymptomatic neurosyphilis:

- **HIV-positive patients**: Those with late syphilis and CD4 cells ≤ 350/mm³ and/or a serum VDRL/RPR titer > 1:32.

- **Serological failure**: Defined as a < 4× decrease in the antibody titer of a non-treponemal test 6–12 months after treatment of early syphilis, or serofast, which is the persistence of a low antibody titer (i.e. ≤ 4) of a non-treponemal test 1–2 years after treatment of early syphilis.

- **Alternative treatment received**: Patients who have received alternative treatment, such as doxycycline, for late syphilis.

### Prospective evaluation of non-invasive saliva specimens for the diagnosis of syphilis and molecular surveillance of [^116qo9jG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*, exhibits a wide variety of clinical presentations, including genital ulcers, skin lesions, hepatitis, meningitis, aortic disease, and neurologic syndromes. In pregnant women, syphilis can lead to fetal loss, stillbirth, neonatal death, and congenital infections in neonates. The global incidence of syphilis has increased significantly in recent decades.

To prevent the transmission of syphilis, it is necessary to promptly identify infected individuals through diagnostic testing, provide appropriate treatment for positive cases, and offer comprehensive sexual health education. Additionally, molecular surveillance of *T. pallidum* clonality has the potential to enhance clinical care and control efforts by contributing to a better understanding of *T. pallidum* acquisition and transmission.

However, the efficient diagnosis and molecular surveillance of syphilis remain challenging.

- **Asymptomatic presentation**: Most patients are asymptomatic and are identified only during screening.
- **Reliance on serologic testing**: The diagnosis of syphilis relies on serologic testing (treponemal and nontreponemal tests), and patients are often missed in the period between the initial *T. pallidum* infection and the appearance of antibodies in early syphilis for serologic testing or because they refuse to provide blood samples.
- **Culture difficulties**: It is difficult to culture *T. pallidum* in vitro.
- **Low bacterial loads**: Lesions of primary and secondary syphilis contain low loads of *T. pallidum*.

### Biological basis for syphilis [^112af83H]. Clinical microbiology reviews (2006). High credibility.

Syphilis is a disease manifested through various symptoms and conditions. These include condylomata lata, weight loss, skin rash, cognitive impairment, aortic aneurysm, genital ulcers, lymphadenopathy, tabes dorsalis, and arthralgia. It is associated with unprotected sexual intercourse and homelessness. Other symptoms may involve treponemal antibodies, multiple sexual partners, oral ulcers, lichenoid lesions, and a positive FTA-ABS test. Moreover, syphilis is linked with anisocoria, fever, scleritis, increased serum transaminases, leukoderma, oral plaques, skin papules, hair loss, aortic dissection, neck stiffness, drug use, seizure, abnormal proprioception, and optic neuritis. The positive treponema pallidum particle agglutination test is a significant marker, along with sore throat, visual disturbances, meningismus, positive VDRL, AV block, psoriasiform rash, retinitis, confusion, myocardial infarction, and STIs.

Additional symptoms include myalgia, headache, tinnitus, uveitis, a painless chancre, malaise, photophobia, genital papules, aortic regurgitation, frambesiform lesions, a positive RPR, lip ulcers, and hearing loss.

### Cutaneous manifestations of syphilis: recognition and management [^114kHrWd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

After a marked decline in the number of syphilis cases due to AIDS prevention campaigns, a significant increase has been observed in states of the former Soviet Union since 1994. In recent years, outbreaks have also been reported in the US, Canada, and several European countries. The epidemic in the US and different parts of Europe has largely involved men who have sex with men, many of whom are infected with HIV.

Since a misdiagnosis of syphilis can have serious consequences for patients, pregnancies, and newborns, clinicians should be aware of the many manifestations of syphilis and its diagnostic and management difficulties. Younger clinicians, in particular, are often no longer familiar with the diverse clinical symptoms and complex diagnostics of syphilis. Patients co-infected with HIV may present with atypical clinical manifestations and laboratory test results.

Furthermore, through its association with an increased risk of HIV infection, syphilis has acquired a new potential for morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of syphilis should be routinely considered in patients with uveitis, sudden deafness, aortic thoracic aneurysm, or during pregnancy. Only a minority of syphilis infections are detected in the primary stage. This may be due to atypical locations and occasionally atypical morphology of the lesions; however, it may also be due to the difficulty of detecting the pathogen. In the secondary stage, which is clinically extremely diverse, the diagnosis is confirmed serologically.

### Syphilis in pregnancy [^111sXip9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite a national plan to eliminate syphilis by 2005, recent trends have reversed previously achieved progress in the United States. After reaching a low point between 2000 and 2013, rates of primary and secondary syphilis among women and congenital syphilis rose by 172% and 185% between 2014 and 2018, respectively. Strategies that obstetrician-gynecologists can employ to combat the epidemic include early screening in pregnancy, repeat screening in the third trimester and at delivery among women at high risk, adherence to recommended treatment regimens, and prompt reporting of newly diagnosed syphilis cases to local public health authorities.

In this report, clinical manifestations and management of syphilis in pregnancy are reviewed, and both traditional and reverse sequence screening algorithms are examined in detail in the context of clinical obstetrics.

### Pulmonary syphilis with a cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia: a case report [^117HvbfW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic disease that progresses through primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Pulmonary manifestations of syphilis are rare, and their histological features have not been well described.

- **Case presentation**: A 78-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a solitary nodular shadow in the right middle lung field on a chest radiograph. Five years before, a rash had appeared on both legs. He was tested for syphilis at a public health center, and the non-treponemal test result was negative. At around 35 years old, he had unspecified sexual intercourse. Chest computed tomography revealed a 13-mm nodule with a cavity in S6 of the right lower lobe of the lung. Robot-assisted resection of the right lower lobe was performed due to suspected localized right lower lobe lung cancer. A cicatricial variant of organizing pneumonia (CiOP) was observed, and immunohistochemistry identified Treponema pallidum inside the macrophages in the nodule cavity. The rapid plasma regain (RPR) value was negative, and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay was positive. The patient was diagnosed with secondary syphilis with pulmonary involvement. Insidious progression of secondary syphilis may result in CiOP and a negative RPR test result.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of pulmonary syphilis with a histological pattern of CiOP. It may be asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose because the RPR test may be negative for a long period. When either non-treponemal or treponemal test results are positive, the possibility of pulmonary syphilis should be considered.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^113yZW16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test, part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively. Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories. However, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the algorithms.

An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

Syphilis and HIV infection often co-exist. Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV and, if negative, offered pre-exposure prophylaxis. They should also be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia. HIV-positive patients have additional indications for CSF evaluation (see table 3). Otherwise, diagnosis and treatment are unchanged.

One of the patients in the study, who presented with bilateral posterior uveitis, including ASPPC, vitritis, and exudative retinal detachment, experienced a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This reaction was characterized by headache, fever, and a generalized maculopapular rash, which started 24 hours after the first dose of benzylpenicillin and was alleviated with paracetamol. The reaction resolved completely within 48 hours. Notably, the patient had an initial serum VDRL titer of 1:256 dilutions upon admission.

- **Evolution of ocular syphilis cases over time**: Over the past fourteen years, the incidence of ocular syphilis at our ophthalmological center has shown a notable trend of increase and fluctuation, reflecting broader epidemiological patterns of syphilis infection, especially in the 2022–2023 biennium, with 10 cases diagnosed.

### Estimation of the lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to syphilis acquired in the United States in 2018 [^117HPGzq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Syphilis, a sexually transmitted genital ulcerative disease caused by infection with Treponema pallidum, can cause a range of adverse health outcomes if left untreated, including severe outcomes relating to pregnancy. In the United States in 2019, there were 129,813 diagnosed syphilis cases, the highest number reported since 1991, and 1,870 reported cases of congenital syphilis, which was four-fold higher than diagnoses in 2013. Considering this large and rising burden, estimates of the lifetime costs and number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost per infection can quantify the public health and economic impact of syphilis infections and inform cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to prevent syphilis. A recent modeling study estimated that the average discounted lifetime cost per infection is $1,190 in the United States. However, to our knowledge, no published studies have assessed the average number of QALYs lost per infection or the overall annual QALY losses attributable to syphilis.

Measuring the health impact of syphilis in adults and congenital syphilis using a standard health metric like QALYs has the benefit of combining the morbidity and mortality impact into one measure. Health conditions like syphilis can cause reductions in the quality and length of life, thereby reducing the number of QALYs that would have been achieved in the absence of syphilis. For example, in adults, early stages of syphilis involve symptoms like sores, skin rashes, fever, and fatigue. The development of tertiary syphilis can affect multiple organ systems.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1165Xufr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which is most often transmitted sexually in acquired disease or vertically during pregnancy in congenital syphilis (CS). Four stages have been described in acquired disease, and overlap can exist between the stages. The primary stage is characterized by a painless ulcerated lesion known as a chancre, which is thought to be the site of entrance into the host. The secondary stage typically occurs 2 weeks to several months after infection and is associated with a skin rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. A period of latency can occur after the secondary stage, and recurrences often present during the first year after diagnosis. Patients can remain in this stage indefinitely or develop tertiary syphilis. During this stage, serious systemic manifestations occur, including cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms, as well as gumma formation throughout the body.

- **Ocular syphilis**: Considered to occur during any stage of infection, and it is known as the "great masquerader". CS has been classified as early CS and late CS. Early CS is characterized by organ involvements including liver, kidney, bone, and hematological and mucocutaneous manifestations. Ocular manifestations, including interstitial keratitis, chorioretinitis, salt–pepper fundus, glaucoma, cataract, and chancres of the eyelid, have been mostly described in late CS. Every patient with ocular inflammation is recommended to be tested for syphilis since non-specific treponemal tests, including the venereal disease research laboratory test, are important in the diagnosis.

### Syphilitic uveitis and optic neuritis in Sydney, Australia [^112JPNJr]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe ocular syphilis presentations to a tertiary referral eye hospital over a 5-year period and to document the frequency of HIV coinfection.

A retrospective chart review was conducted of consecutive ocular syphilis presentations to Sydney Eye Hospital from 2007 to 2012. Inclusion criteria were positive syphilis serology, ocular inflammation on clinical examination, and appropriate syphilis treatment. Outcome measures included clinical features at presentation and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at interval follow-up.

Thirty-seven eyes of 25 patients were included in the series. Patients were predominantly male (92.0%, p < 0.05) with a mean age of 43.7 ± 14.0 years. Eight patients (32.0%) had confirmed HIV coinfection, with three newly diagnosed with HIV. Twelve eyes (32.4%) demonstrated anterior segment involvement with anterior uveitis. Twenty-five eyes (67.6%) demonstrated posterior segment involvement, including panuveitis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, retinitis, necrotising retinitis, punctate retinitis, and optic neuritis. There was a significant improvement in BCVA for involved eyes (p < 0.05) at 1-month and 2–3 months follow-up.

The clinical findings of the 37 eyes with ocular syphilis demonstrated a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Rates of HIV coinfection were high, with patients exhibiting both anterior and posterior segment inflammation. Visual outcomes improved following syphilis treatment.

### Manifest psychosis in neurosyphilis [^113N8WPh]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Recent surveys have assessed a remarkable increase in the prevalence of infectious syphilis. If left untreated, 30% of patients may develop tertiary syphilis, which can manifest as neurosyphilis.

- **Case report**: The authors present a case of acute psychosis during and after pregnancy in a 37-year-old woman, identified as neurosyphilis after admission to a psychiatric ward. The positive screening test for syphilis provided the first hint of the condition and guided further diagnosis and specific treatment. The patient was treated with psychotropic medication alongside adequate antibiotic treatment for neurosyphilis and was simultaneously monitored psychologically. Improvement in psychotic symptoms was observed during antibiotic therapy.

- **Conclusion**: This case emphasizes that neurosyphilis must still be considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric conditions and diseases. Owing to epidemiological data and the difficulties in diagnosing syphilis, routine screening tests in the psychiatric field are necessary.

### Sexually acquired syphilis: Historical aspects, microbiology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations [^113ZB6Lm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Syphilis is caused by infection with the spirochetal bacterium *Treponema pallidum* subsp. pallidum. It was first recognized in the late 15th century. Since 2000, the incidence of sexually acquired syphilis has increased substantially in the developed world, with men who have sex with men and persons living with HIV infection disproportionately affected. Clinical manifestations of syphilis are protean and often include mucocutaneous manifestations. This article reviews the historical aspects, microbiology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of sexually acquired syphilis as part of a continuing medical education series.

### Syphilis laboratory guidelines: Performance characteristics of nontreponemal antibody tests [^111DoAmU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We identified two high-quality papers with a clearly defined gold standard and two lower-quality papers with a less well-defined gold standard for late latent syphilis or syphilis of an unknown duration. There was one high-quality study that reported a sensitivity of 61% for RPR. The other three studies reported a sensitivity of 64–75% for VDRL, and the other high-quality study reported a sensitivity of 64% for VDRL.

Based on a small number of studies (two high-quality and two lower-quality studies), the sensitivity of RPR and VDRL for diagnosing late latent syphilis ranges from 64–75% overall, and ranges from 61–64% based on the two high-quality papers.

For tertiary syphilis, only two lower-quality papers, for which the gold standard was not well defined, were identified. The first, based on 17 patients, reported a VDRL sensitivity of 47%. The second, based on 58 patients, reported a VDRL sensitivity of 64%.

Based on two studies with very limited data, the sensitivity of serum VDRL for tertiary syphilis is 47–64%.

### Syphilis [^1127w5YA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Staging of syphilis cannot be determined through laboratory results alone; it requires a comprehensive history and physical examination. Primary and secondary syphilis are symptomatic, while early and late latent syphilis are generally asymptomatic. A meticulous examination, especially anogenital and dermatologic inspection, is crucial to identify symptoms unnoticed by the patient.

- **Staging criteria for early latent syphilis**: Patients with early latent syphilis are asymptomatic and must meet one of the following conditions:
	- Newly positive serology with a documented negative test within the previous 12* or 24† months
	- A ≥ 4-fold increase in the RPR titre relative to a previous test conducted within 12* or 24† months
	- Unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis observed within the previous 12* or 24† months
	- A single possible exposure, which occurred within the previous 12* or 24† months

Asymptomatic patients with positive serology who do not fulfill the criteria of early latent syphilis could be categorized as having latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration.

### Biological basis for syphilis [^113freNP]. Clinical Microbiology Reviews (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on syphilis:

- **Definition**: Syphilis is a STI caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of syphilis involves the entry of Treponema pallidum through mucous membranes or broken skin during sexual contact. Within days to weeks, Treponema pallidum disseminates via blood and lymphatic vessels and accumulates in perivascular spaces of different organs, leading to various clinical manifestations.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the US is estimated at 17.7 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of late syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration in the US is estimated at 26.3 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for syphilis include unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners, homelessness, history of HIV, history of other STIs, tobacco use, and illicit drug use.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of syphilis is divided into stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by a chancre, typically a single, painless, indurated ulcer with a clean base discharging clear serum. Secondary syphilis involves multisystem manifestations such as a non-itching skin rash, fever, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The latent stage is asymptomatic, and tertiary syphilis can involve neurological, cardiovascular, or gummatous complications.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of syphilis is generally good if detected and treated early, with penicillin being the mainstay of treatment.
