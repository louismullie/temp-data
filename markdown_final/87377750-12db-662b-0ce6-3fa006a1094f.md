## Question

How does the Schatzker classification system guide treatment decisions for tibial plateau fractures?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the Schatzker classification system guides treatment decisions for tibial plateau fractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principles of the Schatzker system and its historical role. Then, I should verify how each Schatzker type maps to treatment pathways, including nonoperative care, ORIF, and external fixation. Next, I will examine the reliability and limitations of Schatzker, especially with plain radiographs versus CT/MRI, and consider modern extensions like the three-column concept. After that, I should integrate soft-tissue considerations, timing, and special scenarios such as posterior plateau and compartment syndrome risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, type-specific treatment algorithm and highlight where Schatzker informs but does not dictate management, ensuring I double-check areas of controversy and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: the Schatzker classification divides tibial plateau fractures into six types based on morphology and presumed energy, and it has long been used to guide treatment intensity, with types I–III typically lower energy and lateral, type IV medial, and types V–VI bicondylar with metaphyseal extension. This morphology-to-treatment linkage is the traditional scaffold for decision-making, though I need to ensure I don't overstate its predictive power for outcomes [^112ZvdwX] [^1167UzQ9].

> Now, for Type I (lateral split), I should confirm that nonoperative management is reasonable when the joint is stable and alignment is acceptable, whereas instability or displacement pushes toward screw-only fixation to restore the lateral cortex. Wait, let me verify the stability threshold — most sources align with ≤ 2 mm step-off and intact ligamentous stability for nonoperative care, but I should acknowledge that exact thresholds vary and are often inferred rather than standardized across studies [^112ZvdwX] [^115z51Wt].

> For Type II (lateral split-depression), I initially thought nonoperative care is never appropriate, but hold on, I should verify that nuance: if depression is minimal (often cited ≤ 2–3 mm) and the knee is stable, nonoperative management can be considered, yet most displaced Type II patterns benefit from ORIF with elevation of the depressed fragment and subchondral support, frequently with bone graft or substitute to prevent collapse. Let me double-check that contemporary series still support this approach, which they do, including the use of locking plates for better fragment support [^112ZvdwX] [^116xYJhA].

> Type III (pure depression) is where I need to be careful: I first recalled that all Type III injuries require surgery, but wait, I should correct that — small, stable depressions may be managed nonoperatively with protected weight-bearing, whereas larger depressions, especially > 3–5 mm, generally warrant elevation and grafting to restore joint congruity and prevent secondary collapse. This aligns with the principle of restoring articular surface to mitigate osteoarthritis risk [^112ZvdwX] [^115z51Wt].

> Type IV (medial plateau) carries higher risk of neurovascular injury and coronal plane instability, so I should confirm that most are treated operatively with buttress plating, often medial or posteromedial, and with a low threshold for angiography or CT angiography when pulses are abnormal. Hold on, I should verify the neurovascular risk assertion — recent data suggest neurovascular complications are uncommon overall and cluster in high-energy, complex patterns rather than being universal in Type IV, but the traditional caution remains prudent [^112ZvdwX] [^114ubK9r].

> Types V and VI (bicondylar with or without metaphyseal-diaphyseal dissociation) are high-energy injuries where I need to ensure soft-tissue-first principles: staged protocols with temporary external fixation to allow swelling to subside are standard, followed by definitive ORIF or hybrid fixation depending on skin condition, fragment geometry, and surgeon expertise. Let me verify outcomes data — multiple series show comparable functional outcomes between circular external fixation and ORIF in selected patients, with cost and infection profiles favoring external fixation in some settings, though evidence quality varies and surgeon factors matter [^112ZvdwX] [^115zcWxw] [^116Akv4d] [^117HoNpf] [^111vbnNp].

> Next, I should review reliability and imaging because treatment decisions hinge on accurate classification. Interobserver agreement for Schatzker using plain radiographs is only moderate at best (κ ≈ 0.4–0.6), and adding 2D CT can improve agreement in some studies but not others, whereas MRI can materially change classification and treatment plans by revealing occult depression, split lines, and ligamentous injuries. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of change — MRI has been shown to alter classification in about 6% and treatment plans in about 21–23% of cases, which is clinically meaningful [^116RN6nC] [^1112dD1o] [^112LbWsa] [^114zZpGq].

> I will now examine modern extensions that refine surgical planning beyond Schatzker. The three-column concept (medial, lateral, posterior) and CT-based mapping identify posterior plateau involvement and coronal fracture planes that Schatzker does not explicitly characterize, guiding posteromedial or posterolateral approaches and dorsal plating when indicated. Let me double-check that these systems improve reliability — yes, several studies show higher interobserver agreement with CT-based column systems than with Schatzker alone, supporting their adjunctive use in complex patterns [^114eKrdG] [^113Di3kN] [^111ZaPEn].

> Soft-tissue status and timing are critical, and I need to ensure I integrate them with Schatzker rather than rely on type alone. High-energy types V–VI, open fractures, and severe swelling warrant staged care with external fixation, whereas carefully selected patients with favorable soft tissues may proceed to early single-stage fixation. But wait, what if the patient is older or has comorbidities? Age and comorbidity modify risk and may push toward less invasive fixation or even nonoperative care in select cases, reinforcing that Schatzker informs but does not dictate treatment [^112ZvdwX] [^113qme3D] [^1151fc23].

> I should confirm special scenarios that Schatzker flags but underdescribes. Posterior tibial plateau fractures, including posteromedial shear, often require direct posterior approaches and specific plating strategies to counter sagittal plane instability; Schatzker does not specify this, so recognizing posterior involvement via CT is essential. Similarly, compartment syndrome risk rises with high-energy patterns, fibular fracture, and Schatzker VI morphology, so I need to maintain a high index of suspicion and monitor closely or consider prophylactic fasciotomy when risk is high [^111ZFNqF] [^113Lojs3] [^113MeRoc] [^1146i6rR].

> Let me synthesize a practical, type-guided algorithm while acknowledging exceptions: Types I–III with minimal displacement and stable knees can be nonoperative with close follow-up. Types I–III with displacement or instability merit ORIF with fragment-specific fixation and grafting as needed. Type IV generally requires medial buttress plating with neurovascular assessment. Types V–VI usually need staged protocols with external fixation followed by definitive fixation, with fixation choice individualized to skin, bone quality, and surgeon expertise. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary reviews and trauma society guidance, which it does, including the emphasis on CT for complex patterns and soft-tissue-first strategies [^112ZvdwX] [^1111yx2V] [^115zcWxw].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: the Schatzker classification remains a useful shorthand for morphology and energy, guiding escalation from nonoperative to ORIF to staged fixation, but its moderate reliability and limited characterization of posterior and coronal plane injuries mean it should be integrated with CT/MRI, three-column thinking, soft-tissue assessment, and patient factors rather than used in isolation. I should double-check that this conclusion matches the evidence base, which consistently supports multimodal planning and acknowledges classification systems as adjuncts, not arbiters, of care [^116UDGgM] [^114eKrdG] [^112ZvdwX].

The Schatzker classification guides tibial plateau fracture management by **linking fracture pattern to treatment intensity** [^112ZvdwX]. Types I–III (lateral plateau) are typically managed with **nonoperative care or limited internal fixation** if stable, whereas types IV–VI (medial or bicondylar) usually require **open reduction and internal fixation** due to instability and higher risk of complications [^112ZvdwX]. CT/MRI improve classification accuracy and surgical planning, especially for complex or posterior patterns [^112ZvdwX] [^114eKrdG]. Soft-tissue status, patient factors, and reliability limits of Schatzker mean treatment should be individualized and not based on classification alone [^112omhqV] [^116UDGgM].

## Schatzker classification and treatment implications

| **Schatzker type** | **Description** | **Typical treatment approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Type I | Lateral split (cleavage) | Nonoperative if stable; percutaneous screws if displaced |
| Type II | Lateral split-depression | ORIF with elevation and grafting; locking plates if bone quality poor |
| Type III | Pure depression (lateral) | Nonoperative if ≤ 3 mm depression; ORIF if > 3 mm or symptomatic |
| Type IV | Medial plateau | ORIF with buttress plating; high risk of neurovascular injury |
| Type V | Bicondylar (two-column) | Staged ORIF or hybrid fixation; high risk of soft-tissue complications |
| Type VI | Metaphyseal-diaphyseal dissociation | Staged external fixation then ORIF; high risk of compartment syndrome |

---

## Clinical decision-making factors

### Fracture pattern and severity

- **Types I–III**: Lower energy, lateral patterns; nonoperative care if stable, with surgery for displacement or instability [^112ZvdwX].
- **Types IV–VI**: Higher energy, medial/bicondylar patterns; surgery due to instability, malalignment, and high complication risk [^112ZvdwX].

---

### Soft-tissue injury

Soft-tissue status **dictates timing and approach**; high-energy injuries often need staged protocols with temporary external fixation to allow swelling to resolve before definitive fixation [^112ZvdwX] [^116Rkfq4].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Age, comorbidities, and activity level influence treatment choice; **older or multimorbid patients** may benefit from less invasive strategies, whereas younger, active patients often undergo ORIF to restore function [^1151fc23].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Reliability**: Moderate interobserver agreement, especially on plain radiographs; CT/MRI improve accuracy but do not eliminate variability [^116RN6nC] [^116UDGgM].
- **Complex patterns**: Posterior plateau and coronal-plane fractures are underrecognized by Schatzker; three-column and CT-based systems aid planning [^114eKrdG] [^113Di3kN].
- **Soft-tissue assessment**: Schatzker does not capture ligament/meniscus injuries; MRI changes management in ~20% of cases [^114zZpGq].

---

## Role of advanced imaging

CT improves detection of depression, split lines, and posterior involvement, enhancing **preoperative planning** [^112ZvdwX] [^114eKrdG]. MRI identifies occult ligament, meniscal, and cartilage injuries, altering **treatment plans** in a meaningful subset [^114zZpGq].

---

## Contemporary modifications and adjuncts

Three-column and CT-based classifications improve **reliability and surgical planning**, especially for posterior and complex patterns [^114eKrdG] [^113Di3kN]. Arthroscopy-assisted techniques facilitate direct joint visualization and **minimally invasive fixation** in select cases [^114U7jLk].

---

## Summary of clinical implications

- **Types I–III**: Nonoperative care if stable; ORIF for displacement, instability, or poor bone quality [^112ZvdwX].
- **Types IV–VI**: ORIF or staged fixation due to instability and high complication risk; CT/MRI guide approach and hardware selection [^112ZvdwX] [^114eKrdG].
- **Individualization**: Use Schatzker as a framework, but tailor decisions to soft tissues, patient factors, and imaging findings [^112omhqV].

---

The Schatzker classification remains a **practical starting point**, but treatment should be individualized using advanced imaging and clinical judgment to optimize outcomes.

### Revisiting the schatzker classification of tibial plateau fractures [^1167UzQ9]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Tibial plateau fractures have a broad spectrum of presentations, depending on the mechanism and energy of the trauma. Many classification systems are currently available to describe these injuries. In 1974, Schatzker proposed a classification based on a two-dimensional representation of the fracture. His classification with the six-principles types became one of the most utilized classification systems for tibial plateau fractures. More than four decades after this original publication, we are revisiting each fracture type in the light of information made available by computed tomography, which today comprises a standard tool in assessing articular fractures. The classification we are proposing relies on the fact that the tibial plateau has two anatomical columns, lateral and medial. We are introducing a virtual equator which splits the articular surface in the coronal plane. The equator divides each column into two quadrants, the anterior (A) and the posterior (P). Unicondylar fracture types (I to IV) have now additional modifiers A (anterior) and P (posterior) to describe the exact spatial location of the primary fracture plane. Bicondylar fracture types (V and VI) have the modifiers (A and P) of the main fracture plane for each column, and lateral (L) and medial (M) to denote the column. We are introducing the concept of the main fracture plane. Recognition of the exact location of the principal fracture plane is essential for preoperative planning of patient positioning, surgical approach and for determining where to apply the hardware to achieve stable fixation. The new three-dimensional classification is based on the template of the original Schatzker classification. It covers the mechanism of the injury, the energy of the trauma, the morphologic characteristics of the fracture and its location in three dimensions.

### Revisiting the management of tibial plateau fractures [^112gCyYH]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional imaging has changed the understanding and management of tibial plateau fractures. In the 1970s, Schatzker proposed a classification for tibial plateau fractures, which highlighted the morphology of the six principal types. More recently, this original classification was complimented by an extended one underscoring the importance of understanding where the split wedge fragment(s) is/are located in three dimensions. The extended classification introduced the split wedge fragment and the continuity of the rim as the determinants of joint stability and the critical role that this plays in the management of tibial plateau fractures. The current manuscript re-emphasizes contemporary concepts of tibial plateau stability and depicts key issues which must be considered when planning the definitive surgical fixation of tibial plateau fractures.

### The AO classification system for tibial plateau fractures: an independent inter and intraobserver agreement study [^112dpKqm]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Classifying tibial plateau fractures is paramount in determining treatment regimens and systemizing decision making. The original AO classification described by Müller in 1996 and the Schatzker classification of 1970 are the most cited classifications for tibial plateau fractures, demonstrating substantial to almost perfect agreement. The main problem with these classifications schemes is that they lack the detail required to convey the variety of fracture patterns encountered. In 2018, the AO foundation published a new classification system for proximal tibia fractures, highlighting a more complete and detailed number of categories and subcategories. We sought to independently determine inter and intraobserver agreement of the AO classification system, compared to the previous systems described by Müller and Schatzker.

Methods

One hundred seven consecutive tibial plateau fractures were screened, and a representative data set of 69 was created. Six independent evaluators (three knee surgeons, three senior orthopedic residents) classified the fractures using the original AO, the Schatzker and the new AO classifications. After six weeks, the 69 cases were randomized and reclassified by all evaluators. The Kappa coefficient (k) was calculated for inter- and intraobserver correlation and is expressed with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

interobserver agreement was moderate for all three classifications. k = 0.464 (0.383–0.560) for the original AO; k = 0.404 (0.337–0.489) for Schatzker; and k = 0.457 (0.371–0.545) for the base categories of the new AO classification. The inclusion of subcategories and letter modifiers to the new classification worsened agreement to k = 0.358 (0.302–0.423) and k = 0.174 (0.134–0.222), respectively. There were no significant differences between knee surgeons and residents for the new classification. Intra-observer correlation was also moderate for each of the scores: k = 0.630 (0.578–0.682) for the original AO; k = 0.623 (0.569–0.674) for Schatzker; and k = 0.621 (0.566–0.678) for the new AO base categories; without differences between knee surgeons or residents.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated an adequate inter and intra-observer agreement for the new AO tibial plateau fractures classification system for its base categories, but not at the subcategory or letter modifier levels.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^114QNs7W]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tibial plateau fractures are often complex, and they can be challenging to treat. Classifying fractures is often part of the treatment process, but intra- and interobserver reliability of fracture classification systems often is inadequate to the task, and classifications that lack reliability can mislead providers and result in harm to patients. Three-dimensionally (3D)-printed models might help in this regard, but whether that is the case for the classification of tibial plateau fractures, and whether the utility of such models might vary by the experience of the individual classifying the fractures, is unknown.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does the overall interobserver agreement improve when fractures are classified with 3D-printed models compared with conventional radiology? (2) Does interobserver agreement vary among attending and consultant trauma surgeons, senior surgical residents, and junior surgical residents? (3) Do surgeons' and surgical residents' confidence and accuracy improve when tibial plateau fractures are classified with an additional 3D model compared with conventional radiology?

Methods

Between 2012 and 2020, 113 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated at a Level 1 trauma center. Forty-four patients were excluded based on the presence of bone diseases (such as osteoporosis) and the absence of a CT scan. To increase the chance to detect an improvement or deterioration and to prevent observers from losing focus during the classification, we decided to include 40 patients with tibial plateau fractures. Nine trauma surgeons, eight senior surgical residents, and eight junior surgical residents-none of whom underwent any study-specific pretraining-classified these fractures according to three often-used classification systems (Schatzker, OA/OTA, and the Luo three-column concept), with and without 3D-printed models, and they indicated their overall confidence on a 10-point Likert scale, with 0 meaning not confident at all and 10 absolutely certainty. To set the gold standard, a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons who had special expertise in knee surgery and 10 years to 25 years of experience in practice also classified the fractures until consensus was reached. The Fleiss kappa was used to determine interobserver agreement for fracture classification. Differences in confidence in assessing fractures with and without the 3D-printed model were compared using a paired t-test. Accuracy was calculated by comparing the participants' observations with the gold standard.

Results

The overall interobserver agreement improved minimally for fracture classification according to two of three classification systems (Schatzker: κconv = 0.514 versus κ3Dprint = 0.539; p = 0.005; AO/OTA:κconv = 0.359 versus κ3Dprint = 0.372; p = 0.03). However, none of the classification systems, even when used by our most experienced group of trauma surgeons, achieved more than moderate interobserver agreement, meaning that a large proportion of fractures were misclassified by at least one observer. Overall, there was no improvement in self-assessed confidence in classifying fractures or accuracy with 3D-printed models; confidence was high (about 7 points on a 10-point scale) as rated by all observers, despite moderate or worse accuracy and interobserver agreement.

Conclusion

Although 3D-printed models minimally improved the overall interobserver agreement for two of three classification systems, none of the classification systems achieved more than moderate interobserver agreement. This suggests that even with 3D-printed models, many fractures would be misclassified, which could result in misleading communication, inaccurate prognostic assessments, unclear research, and incorrect treatment choices. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of 3D-printed models in practice and research for classification of tibial plateau fractures.

### Three-column classification system for tibial plateau fractures: what the orthopedic surgeon wants to know [^114eKrdG]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent orthopedic surgical literature emphasizes a three-column approach to understand and guide the treatment of tibial plateau fractures. This three-column classification system published in 2010 relies on preoperative CT images to depict injuries to the medial, lateral, and posterior columns of the tibial plateau and improves surgical outcomes in complex tibial plateau fractures with coronal fracture planes and posterior plateau fracture fragments requiring dorsal plating. Tibial plateau fracture classification systems traditionally used by radiologists and orthopedic surgeons, including the Schatzker and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen-Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO-OTA) classification systems, rely on findings at anteroposterior radiography and lack the terminology to accurately characterize fractures in the coronal plane involving the posterior tibial plateau. Incorporating elements from the contemporary three-column classification system into radiology reports will enhance radiologists' descriptions of these injuries. It is essential for radiologists to understand the role of clinical assessment and the pertinent imaging findings taken into consideration by orthopedic surgeons in their management of these injuries. This understanding includes familiarity with injury patterns and how they relate to mechanism of injury, patient demographics, and underlying pertinent comorbidities. Evaluating findings on initial radiographs is the basis of tibial plateau fracture diagnosis. Additional information provided by preoperative cross-sectional imaging, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT and MRI in specific circumstances, aids in the identification of specific soft-tissue injuries and fracture morphologies that influence surgical management. These specific fracture morphologies and soft-tissue injuries should be identified and communicated to orthopedic surgeons for optimal patient management.

### A systematic literature review of tibial plateau fractures: what classifications are used and how reliable and useful are they? [^116UDGgM]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Classification systems such as the Schatzker and AO/OTA have been proposed for standardised assessment of tibial plateau fractures and to guide clinical decision making. However, there has been no comprehensive literature review of all classification systems for tibial plateau fractures, including assessment of their reliability. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and appraise previously established classification systems for tibial plateau fractures and determine their reliability for fracture classification.

Methods

Six databases were searched from inception until October 2016. Classification systems for tibial plateau fractures were identified. No restriction was placed on imaging modality (plain film X-ray, CT, MRI). Data synthesis was performed to identify common features of the systems, their prevalence within the literature and studies of intra and inter-rater reliability of fracture classification using Kappa coefficient (κ).

Results

Thirty-eight classification systems were identified, five of which were a sub-classification of a single fracture type from a previous tool. The Schatzker and AO/OTA classification systems were the most commonly reported. Of the tools identified only five have been tested for inter and intra-observer reliability (Schatzker, AO/OTA, Duparc, Hohl and Luo). Reliability of more simplistic classification systems, such as that by Luo et al. (three-column) was typically high (intra-κ = 0.67–0.81, inter-κ = 0.71–0.87), but with the disadvantage of providing less information on fracture patterns and morphology. Intra and inter-observer reliability using plain film X-ray was frequently moderate (κ = 0.40–0.60), with 2D and 3D CT typically improving reliability of classification. Only 11 of the 32 complete classification systems identified association of fracture classification with clinical outcome.

Discussion

Frequently used systems for classification of tibial plateau fractures display moderate intra and inter-observer reliability. More sophisticated imaging modalities such as 2D and 3D CT typically improve reliability estimates. Using fracture classification based on imaging findings to predict clinical outcome was not a commonly reported goal of newly developed systems. More detailed assessment of fracture patterns and morphology, in conjunction with information on surgical fixation, may be desirable for predicting outcomes and to guide clinical decision making.

### 3D modelling of tibial plateau fractures: variability in fracture location and characteristics across schatzker fracture types [^113FCxnA]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Numerous classifications have been developed to assess tibial plateau fractures (TPF). Of these, the Schatzker system is the most widely reported in the literature yet this system is limited in its characterisation of morphological fracture features underlying the fracture location. The purpose of this study was to compare 3D morphological features of TPFs across different Schatzker types.

Methods

This study retrospectively analysed preoperative TPF imaging data to reconstruct 3D models of the fractures. Ninety-one fractures (29 female, 62 male) were analysed and classified using Schatzker. Fracture location across Schatzker types was compared based on division of the articular surface into six 'zones'. Additionally, morphological characteristics of the fractures were compared based on fracture type, including; the number, volume and shape of the fragments.

Results

Schatzker II, IV and VI fractures were most common, making up 41%, 16% and 20%, respectively. Type II fractures commonly involved both the lateral and central aspect of the tibial plateau, similarly, type IV fractures incorporated the lateral condyle in most cases. Considering the morphological metrics, statistically significant differences were observed between Schatzker types for the number of; total, articular, cortical and volumetrically significant (all P < 0.001) fragments along with the volume of both primary (P < 0.001) and secondary (P = 0.02) fragments.

Discussion

Assessment of underlying fracture characteristics in addition to fracture location can serve to provide greater detail relating to fracture morphology, which has the potential to assist with both surgical decision making and assessment of postoperative outcomes. Incorporating this information as part of a hierarchical or multifactorial framework for classifying fractures may help distinguish subtle differences between fracture types that are classifiable using the most current systems.

### Schatzker classification of tibial plateau fractures: use of CT and MR imaging improves assessment [^112ZvdwX]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

The Schatzker classification system for tibial plateau fractures is widely used by orthopedic surgeons to assess the initial injury, plan management, and predict prognosis. Many investigators have found that surgical plans based on plain radiographic findings were modified after preoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The Schatzker classification divides tibial plateau fractures into six types: lateral plateau fracture without depression (type I), lateral plateau fracture with depression (type II), compression fracture of the lateral (type IIIA) or central (type IIIB) plateau, medial plateau fracture (type IV), bicondylar plateau fracture (type V), and plateau fracture with diaphyseal discontinuity (type VI). Management of type I, II, and III fractures centers on evaluating and repairing the articular cartilage. The fracture-dislocation mechanism of type IV fractures increases the likelihood of injury to the peroneal nerve or popliteal vessels. In type V and VI fractures, the location of soft-tissue injury dictates the surgical approach and the degree of soft-tissue swelling dictates the timing of definitive surgery and the need for provisional stabilization with an external fixator. CT and MR imaging are more accurate than plain radiography for Schatzker classification of tibial plateau fractures, and use of cross-sectional imaging can improve surgical planning.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^1123QDpA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex fractures of the proximal tibia's articular surface known as tibial plateau fractures may also affect the tibia's metaphysis and diaphysis. These can result from various causes such as motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, falls, and low-energy trauma in older individuals. These fractures correspond to 1% of all fractures and 8% in geriatrics. These fractures are often classified using the Schatzker classification and the AO/OTA classification. Schatzker type V and VI fractures are high-energy fractures often accompanied by other local and systemic injuries. Postoperative complications such as wound healing problems, infections, and secondary degenerative arthritis are quite common.

They present a significant challenge for orthopedic surgeons and are associated with a guarded prognosis. The goal of treating a tibial plateau fracture is to stabilize the knee joint while restoring articular congruency and a pain-free range of motion by fragment-specific fixation. Most patients have significant residual dysfunction even after the completion of treatment.

Tibial plateau fractures present a challenging clinical scenario, with various treatment options available. Standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using plates has been the benchmark, but approaches, such as closed reduction and external fixation (CREF) with Ilizarov rings or hybrid fixators, remain an alternative option in many parts of the world particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where safe ORIF is not readily available. However, controversy surrounds the optimal management of Schatzker type V and VI fractures. Despite successful ORIF outcomes in terms of fracture reduction and stability, complications remain a concern, including deep wound infections and unplanned secondary procedures. As an alternative, Ilizarov ring fixation, offers a reasonable approach, although it comes with its own challenges, such as external fixator maintenance and the risk of pin tract infections leading to fracture collapse.

Given the complexity and challenging nature of Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures, understanding the optimal treatment approach is crucial. By evaluating both CREF and ORIF methods, this study aims to provide valuable insights that can enhance patient outcomes and guide clinical decision making. The authors hypothesized that patients treated with the Ilizarov fixator (CREF) would achieve superior outcomes compared with those undergoing ORIF.

Our research contributes novel perspectives to the existing literature, emphasizing practical considerations for orthopedic surgeons in LMICs.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^112M1Sf7]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fractures of the tibial plateau are among the most challenging fractures in orthopedics to treat. To prevent posttraumatic osteoarthritis and to restore optimal joint function, the congruency of the articular surface, the stability, and the correct load distribution needs to be restored.

To achieve this goal, an accurate preoperative planning is essential. In addition to the conventional plain radiographs, the CT scan is increasingly used. However, limited studies are available that report additional value of a CT scan. Considering the additional load of radiation to the patient and costs, a CT scan should only be used when justified by the clinical benefits.

With this intra- and interobserver study, the value of the CT scan in addition to plain radiographs for the classification of tibial plateau fractures according to Schatzker and the preoperative treatment plan was investigated.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^115qGGqt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the management of proximal tibial fractures in LMICs, highlighting the nuanced benefits of CREF over ORIF methods. Although statistical significance was not achieved, CREF demonstrated a favorable trend in outcomes. The CREF group showed promising trends with shorter surgical wait times, reduced blood loss, and a lower incidence of complications, particularly infections — a critical consideration in resource-constrained settings. Functional outcomes, as assessed at the final follow-up, indicated substantial improvement, aligning closely with standards observed in developed countries. Both groups achieved comparable results in terms of radiological and functional outcomes, with a slight preference toward CREF. These findings underscore the potential of CREF as a viable option for optimizing patient outcomes in LMICs, emphasizing the need for tailored perioperative strategies and continued research to further enhance surgical care and patient recovery in these challenging contexts. It is important to note that larger-scale studies are warranted to validate these results comprehensively. Nonetheless, this study lays a foundation for informed clinical decision making in settings where timely and effective interventions are crucial.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^115nr4aK]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Concluding from this study, the use of a CT scan in addition to the plain radiographs in tibial plateau fractures did not result in a better intra- and interobserver agreement for the classification according to Schatzker and treatment plan. Considering additional costs and radiation, the routine use of a CT scan for tibial plateau fractures is questionable.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^111NGixw]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

To cover all types of the Schatzker classification (1–6) at least twice, 15 patients with tibial plateau fractures were selected from our clinic by two experienced surgeons, who did not participate as an observer in this study.

Observers were not informed about the distribution of the types. Both plain radiographs and CT scans had to be available for this study. None of the selected cases had an open fracture. The radiographs of eight male and seven female patients with a mean age of 45 years (range, 12–78 years) were included.

The plain radiographs and CT scans of all cases were presented independently to six surgeons and two radiologists, all working in our level 1 trauma center for several years. CT scans were two-dimensional reconstructions performed by multislice thickness of at least 2 mm. No three-dimensional reconstructions were shown. The observers were allowed to use all Agfa's IMPAX Web1000® application tools.

After presentation of the plain radiographs, the observers were asked to classify the fractures according to Schatzker. This classification is most commonly used as a guide for treatment of these fractures. Each increasing numeric category indicates increasing severity: increased energy imparted to the bone and worse prognosis. Management of types 1–3 centers on evaluating and repairing articular cartilage, the fracture-dislocation mechanism of type 4 increases the likelihood of injury to the peroneal nerve or popliteal vessels, and in types 5 and 6, the soft tissue status dictates the need for provisional stabilization with external fixation before definitive surgery. A description of the classification with an illustration was presented to all observers during the test (Fig. 1). Next, the surgeons were asked to set up a treatment plan by selecting multiple options considering the surgical approach, the type of reduction, and stabilization (Table 1). Finally, they were asked if they would consider a CT scan necessary. After presentation of the CT scan, the classification was reconsidered, as well as the treatment plan.

### The classification systems for tibial plateau fractures: how reliable are they? [^116RN6nC]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to assess the inter-observer reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of three different classification systems for tibial plateau fractures.

Materials and Methods

Four observers of various levels of experience classified 50 tibial plateau fractures. The same observers repeated the classification of the same fractures after an interval of 8 weeks. Inter- and intra-observer variability was assessed using the mean kappa co-efficient and the mean percentage of agreement.

Results

For inter-observer reliability, the mean kappa co-efficient values for Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO), Schatzker and Hohl and Moore classifications were 0.36, 0.47 and 0.14, respectively. The mean percentage of agreement was 0.52, 0.59 and 0.34, respectively. For intra-observer reliability kappa-values were 0.80, 0.91 and 0.76 and the mean percentage of agreement was 0.88, 0.93 and 0.85 in the same order.

Conclusions

Our results show that none of the classification systems were ideal. The Schatzker classification system was superior to the AO and the Hohl and Moore systems both in terms of inter-observer reliability and intra-observer reproducibility. However, there is a need for developing a more comprehensive approach to judge the classification systems.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^111hybR1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology

This retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted within the Orthopedics Section of the Department of Surgery at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, with ethical approval from the institutional review board.

The study included all patients treated at the hospital from January 2016 to December 2022 who were diagnosed with Schatzker type V or VI tibial plateau fractures, aged 18 to 60 years, of both sexes. A total of 60 patients were included in the study, with 30 patients in each of the CREF and ORIF groups. Exclusion criteria included patients with neurovascular injuries, open fractures, those who underwent redo surgery or were primarily operated outside our center, or those with grade III or IV osteoarthritis of the knee joint (as per the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system). Patients diagnosed with type V or VI fractures were given the choice between ORIF or CREF. The method of selection was entirely patient driven, allowing individuals to choose their preferred treatment option. When both CREF and ORIF were viable, patients received comprehensive counseling on each technique, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of both. By presenting these options and empowering patients to make informed decisions, surgeons performed the chosen procedure based on the patient's preference.

Data were obtained and collected from electronic medical records, radiographs, and surgical notes, including patient demographics (age, sex, comorbidities), injury-related factors (mechanism of injury, fracture classification based on preoperative radiographs), and surgical details. Quantitative variables, such as age, surgery duration, waiting period before surgery, blood loss during surgery, medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), posterior proximal tibial angle (PPTA), radiological union time, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) at 1 year, and knee flexion, were reported as mean and SD. Qualitative factors, such as sex distribution and complications, were summarized using frequency and percentage. Patients with missing data or incomplete follow-ups were excluded.

Clinical functional outcomes were assessed using the OKS, and radiological outcomes were evaluated through postoperative radiographs to assess fracture reduction. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the association between complications and the mode of treatment. Data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Quantitative outcomes were compared using the Mann-Whitney U -test for non-normally distributed data and the independent t -test for normally distributed data. A significance level of P < 0.05 was used. The means of the two groups were compared to determine statistical significance.

### Fractures of the tibial plateaus… [^116RGrpe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In cases of fracture of the tibial plateau the question whether to use open or closed methods of treatment must be answered by considering all the factors that may determine the degree of permanent residual disability. Since continued use of a deformed knee is likely to cause late arthritic changes, deformity that cannot otherwise be corrected is the primary indication for surgical procedures. In a series of 63 fractures of this kind, open reduction was considered necessary in only 7. The closed, nonoperative treatment used in the other 56 cases included these features: aspiration of free blood and joint fluid, manipulation with the patient under general anesthesia to correct deformity, skeletal traction, early motion, transfer from splint to brace, protection during the period of healing, and a program of exercises begun early and continued over a period of months.

Unprotected weight-bearing cannot be permitted until union is solid, and a certain amount of permanent residual disability may be expected. Turner VC. FRACTURES OF THE TIBIAL PLATEAUS.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^115hAaC8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

3D-printed models do not lead to a clinically relevant improvement in interobserver agreement for the AO/OTA classification, Schatzker classification, or the Luo three-column concept, and therefore, they offer no additional value in the classification of tibial plateau fractures compared with conventional radiographs and CT scans. Furthermore, in this study, we did not record any instances of interobserver agreement more than moderate, which suggests that a high number of tibial plateau fractures would be misclassified when using these three classification systems. This could result in incorrect treatment of patients with tibial plateau fractures, more posttraumatic complications, and a longer recovery. Therefore, we cannot recommend the use of models in the classification of tibial plateau fractures.

Fig. 1
The classification according to Schatzker divides the tibial plateau fractures into six types: lateral split fracture (1), lateral split fracture with depression (2), central depression fracture (3), medial condyle fracture (4), bicondylar fracture (5), and fracture with diaphysial discontinuity (6)

Table 1
The multiple options for setting up the treatment plan for specific tibial plateau fractures

One investigator supervised all observers to prevent them from changing answers of the classification and treatment plan based on plain radiographs, after studying the CT scan.

Three weeks later, the same cases were presented to the same observers in a different order.

A complete dataset was available for analysis. To define the intra- and interobserver agreement, the mean Cohen's kappa coefficient as described by Dunn was used. Kappa is a coefficient of agreement, which varies from +1 (perfect agreement) to 0 (agreement no better than chance) to −1 (representing absolute disagreement). These were calculated with the statistical programs SPPS® version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc® version 9.6.4.0 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).

The results of the first reading were used to determine interobserver agreement. Cohen's kappa coefficients were interpreted according to Landis and Koch.

Results

The values for the intra- and interobserver agreement for the treatment subcategories are presented in Table 2.

Table 2
Intra- and interobserver agreement over plain radiographs and CT scans for the classification, overall treatment and treatment subdivisions (with range)

Intraobserver agreement

The mean kappa coefficient for the Schatzker classification using plain films was 0.60 (range, 0.38 to 0.83) and with addition of the CT scan 0.57 (range, 0.43–0.74). Both values represent "moderate" intraobserver reliability (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Mean intra- and interobserver agreement over fracture classification according to Schatzker (with range)

The mean kappa coefficient for the treatment plan based on plain radiographs was 0.53 (range, 0.40–0.65); with a CT scan, this was 0.45 (range, 0.19–0.69). Both represent a "moderate" interobserver reliability (Fig. 3).

Mean intra- and interobserver agreement over treatment plan for plain radiographs and CT scan (with range)

Interobserver agreement

The mean kappa coefficient for the Schatzker classification using plain radiographs was 0.47 (range, 0.13–0.74), and with addition of the CT scans, it was 0.46 (range, 0.24–0.73). Both values represent a "moderate" interobserver reliability (Fig. 2).

The mean kappa coefficient for the treatment plan based on plain radiographs was 0.40 (range, 0.18–0.62); with a CT scan, this was 0.30 (range, 0.11–0.56). Both represent a "fair" interobserver reliability (Fig. 3).

Request for additional CT scan

In 81% of all cases, the observers thought that an additional CT scan was appropriate.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^116ETKeG]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the classification according to Schatzker was developed in a time when CT scans were not readily available. Perhaps, a new classification based on CT findings would improve inter- and intraobserver agreement.

Furthermore, we studied the value of an additional CT scan in relation to the treatment plan. The results showed no increase in the inter- and intraobserver agreement for the treatment plan with the addition of a CT scan.

This is in contrast to an earlier publication by Chan that showed an increase in agreement for the treatment plan from 0.58 with plain radiographs to 0.71 with CT scans. Based on this finding, it was concluded that all patients with a tibial plateau fractures should have a CT scan.

A study by Yacoubian showed a slight improvement of the observer agreement from 0.72 with plain radiographs to 0.77 with CT scans. There are several possible reasons for our different findings.

The options of treatment plan of the study by Chan were limited to three treatment options. In our study, we used a multiple-option treatment plan with ten different modalities (Table 1). This may explain the lower inter- and intraobserver agreement. We believe that a precise description of multiple options for the treatment plan is more realistic.

The second reason can be the difference between the experience of the participating surgeons.

In other studies, observers with less training/residents were included as observer. In this study, all observers had at least 10 years of experience with interpretation of plain radiographs and clinical trauma surgery.

Making a CT scan can be potentially dangerous because of the use of ionizing radiation and therefore can cause cancer. In fact, in the USA alone, it is estimated that the use of CT scans accounts for around 6,000 additional cancers per year, with about half of those proving fatal.

Furthermore, cost-effectiveness is a factor that should be taken into consideration. Clear benefits must be proven to justify increased costs. Concerns arise when CT examinations are used without proven clinical rationale or when alternative modalities could be used with equal efficacy.

The clinical implication of the study is that surgeons should classify a tibial plateau fracture based on a series of plain radiographs and set up a treatment plan. Only if there specific questions concerning the treatment plan remain that a CT scan should be considered. In our hospital, CT scans for tibial plateau fractures are not performed routinely anymore.

### Operative treatment of tibial plateau fractures in patients older than 55 years [^1151fc23]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures in the older patient poses an additional challenge because of the underlying condition of the bone and articular surface. We sought to identify risk factors for poorer outcomes in the operative treatment of displaced tibial plateau fractures in older patients. Thirty-nine displaced tibial plateau fractures in patients 55 years and older were treated operatively. Patients were evaluated objectively with Rasmussen clinical and radiologic scoring techniques, and the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment and the Short-Form 36 self-assessment instruments. The Rasmussen clinical and radiologic scoring systems, used on average 2.54 years postoperatively, found acceptable results in 87.2% and 82.1% of patients, respectively. The fracture classification of Schatzker was not predictive of results. External fixation was associated with significantly poorer results. Increasing age was associated with poorer clinical and self-assessment scores, although preexisting degenerative joint disease was not. The results from the Short-Form 36 indices were not significantly worse for our study patients. The average Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment score of our study patients indicated poorer function for mobility than a normative group. Operative treatment of this injury in this population can result in favorable outcomes as evaluated by clinical, radiographic, and self-assessment criteria.

### Is "Early total care" a safe and effective alternative to "Staged protocol" for the treatment of schatzker IV-VI tibial plateau fractures in patients older than 50 years? [^113qme3D]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare "Early Total Care" (ETC) with "Staged Protocol" (SP) for the treatment of Schatzker IV-VI tibial plateau fractures in patients older than 50 years regarding safety and effectiveness.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

An academic level 1 US trauma center.

Patients/Participants

Eighty-one patients older than 50 years with Schatzker grade IV-VI tibial plateau fractures were included.

Intervention

Fifty-three patients were treated under SP with immediate external fixation followed by definitive internal fixation. Twenty-eight patients were treated under ETC with immediate internal fixation.

Main Outcome Measurements

Comparison of perioperative findings, time to bony and clinical union, soft-tissue and bony complications, radiological outcome, and secondary procedures.

Results

The 2 groups were comparable without significant difference regarding age, sex, side of involvement, body mass index, smoking status, American Society of Anesthesiologist classification, associated injuries, comorbidities, follow-up duration, and fracture classification. No statistically significant difference was found regarding the perioperative complications, quality of reduction, time to union, Rasmussen score at union or at the final follow-up, soft-tissue/bony complications, and the rate of the secondary procedures.

Conclusion

ETC seems to be a safe, efficacious, and effective alternative to the SP for the treatment of some Schatzker IV-VI fractures in patients older than 50 years.

### CT of periarticular adult knee fractures: classification and management implications [^1111yx2V]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Periarticular knee fractures, which include fractures of the distal femur, tibial plateau, and patella, account for 5%-10% of musculoskeletal injuries encountered in trauma centers and emergency rooms. These injuries are frequently complex, with articular surface involvement. Surgical principles center on reconstruction of the articular surface as well as restoration of limb length, alignment, and rotation to reestablish functional knee biomechanics. Fixation principles are guided by fracture morphology, and thus, CT with multiplanar reformats and volume rendering is routinely used to help plan surgical intervention. Fractures involving the distal femur, tibial plateau, and patella have distinct management considerations. This comprehensive CT primer of periarticular knee fractures promotes succinct and clinically relevant reporting as well as optimized communication with orthopedic trauma surgeon colleagues by tying fracture type and key CT findings with surgical decision making. Fracture patterns are presented within commonly employed fracture classification systems, rooted in specific biomechanical principles. Fracture typing of distal femur fractures and patellar fractures is performed using Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification schemes. Tibial plateau fractures are graded using the Schatzker system, informed by a newer explicitly CT-based three-column concept. For each anatomic region, the fracture pattern helps determine the surgical access required, whether bone grafting is warranted, and the choice of hardware that achieves suitable functional outcomes while minimizing the risk of articular collapse and accelerated osteoarthritis. Emphasis is also placed on recognizing bony avulsive patterns that suggest ligament injury to help guide stress testing in the early acute period. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^113jUZ9a]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications remain a significant concern for both patients and surgeons as they can significantly affect overall morbidity. In our study, the CREF group experienced fewer complications compared with the ORIF group, consistent with findings in the literature. The most prevalent complication was infection (surgical infection), affecting 10% of patients, which is a major contributor to morbidity, particularly in LMICs. - Comparing our results with other studies, our infection rate was significantly lower or similar, and absence of deep surgical site infectionsindicate better perioperative management of the patients. The outcomes and complications are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. This suggests that enhanced perioperative care and vigilant measures may have contributed to better outcomes in infection control in LMICs.

Table 3
Outcome and Complications of External Fixator (Ilizarov Osteosynthesis) in Schatzker Type V and Type VI Fractures Available in Literature

Table 4
Outcome and Complications of Internal Fixation in Schatzker Type V and Type VI Fractures Available in the Literature

This study has several limitations. The small sample size may restrict the applicability of the findings, particularly in LMICs, potentially leading to biases. In addition, the absence of Tscherne grading for soft-tissue swelling limits our ability to assess its effect on treatment outcomes. Moreover, although we chose the Schatzker classification for proximal tibial injuries because of its prevalence and ease of use in LMICs, it may not capture all aspects of injury severity as effectively as the OTA classification. These factors underscore the need for further research with larger, more representative cohorts and standardized assessment methods.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^117HoNpf]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Tibial plateau fractures are complex injuries involving the articular surface of the proximal tibia and often accompanied by soft-tissue damage. These fractures are challenging due to their potential to disrupt knee joint stability and function. Schatzker classification is widely used to categorize these fractures globally. Several different treatment modalities, focused on stabilizing the knee joint while restoring pain-free motion, are used for treatment. Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures are treated with two different approaches: open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction and external fixation (CREF). The primary objective is to assess and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of ORIF versus CREF for Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures.

Methods:

This research was done retrospectively at the Aga Khan University Hospital. This study comprised 60 patients with type V and VI tibial plateau fractures who underwent internal fixation or external fixation from 2016 to 2022. Patients were divided into two groups with 30 patients each: the CREF group (patients treated with closed reduction and external fixation using Ilizarov as external fixator), and the ORIF group.

Results:

The CREF group consisted of 1 type V and 29 type VI fractures, whereas the ORIF group included 20 type V and 10 type VI fractures. The Oxford Knee Score was 40 points for each group at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, the Oxford Knee Score was 45 points for the CREF group and 44 points for the ORIF group.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, our study highlights the benefits of CREF over ORIF for proximal tibial fractures in low- and middle-income countries. CREF showed shorter surgical duration and wait times, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications, particularly infections. Both groups had comparable radiological and functional outcomes, with a slight preference for CREF. These findings emphasize the potential of CREF in resource-constrained settings.

### Injury severity assessment in tibial plateau fractures [^112omhqV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Assessment of injury severity is an integral component of the care of the patient with a fracture of the tibial plateau. Devising ways to reliably quantify injury severity, and to make predictive links between injury severity and outcome, however, has been difficult. Assessment of patient-related factors, such as age, functional capabilities, and medical comorbidities, are necessarily subjective, but certain of these factors clearly shape the treatment plan for a patient with a tibial plateau fracture. Clinical examination findings, such as extent of soft tissue injury and mediolateral stability of the knee, also play an important role in determining treatment and predicting outcome. Radiographic classification of tibial plateau fractures also is an important determinant of treatment, but current classification systems have suffered from disappointing interobserver reliability. Although the severity of injury to the articular cartilage almost certainly affects outcome, there currently are no validated modalities to measure this important factor. More carefully validated tools are needed in many of these areas if we are to perfect our understanding of injury severity and establish more accurate correlations between injury severity and outcomes.

### Two column classification of tibial plateau fractures; description, clinical application and reliability [^111ZaPEn]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In this era of life highly comminuted and multi planar tibial plateau fractures involving the posterior corners are more commonly seen and addressed in the literature than before. Among these several types have not been described in the currently used classification systems. In fact simple classification systems ignore several fracture types and leniently grouped the fractures with different mechanism, morphology, treatment modalities and prognosis in same category. On the other hand, more extensive nature classifications with detailed subdivisions are difficult to remember for clinicians. The clinical reliability of these classifications is another problem. All these issues demand the potential need of a new classification. The aim of this study was to describe a quadrant specific two column classification of tibial plateau fractures and to analyse its inter-observer and intra-observer reliability, clinical assessment and application.

Materials and Methods

From January 2009 to December 2015, 44 patients with tibial plateau fractures were studied retrospectively. The antero-posterior (AP), lateral X-rays and computed tomography (CT) with axial transverse, sagittal, coronal and three dimensional (3D) reconstruction images were performed for all the patients. All of the fractures were categorized according to quadrant specific two column classification and the traditional Schatzker's classification. The comparative analysis for inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of the new classification and the Schatzker's classification was conducted by four observers.

Results

Three cases didn't match any type in the Schatzker's classification. While on the other hand, all cases were classified by two column classification. The mean kappa values for inter-observer reliability by using the Schatzker's classification was 0.723 (range, 0.674–0.823), representing substantial agreement, whereas the mean kappa value was 0.939 (range: 0.897–0.974), representing almost perfect agreement according to two column classification. The mean kappa values for intra-observer reliability using the Schatzker's classification and two column classification were 0.789 (range: 0.590–0.864) and 0.955 (range:0.923–0.948) showing substantial agreement and almost perfect agreement.

Conclusion

The quadrant specific two column classification is anatomically oriented, CT based and clinically valid. The different fracture types according to anatomic location are represented alphanumerically so that treatment matched to specific fracture type (quadrant specific anatomic fixation) for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, it demonstrates higher inter-observer and intra-observer reliability. This classification can be adopted to strengthen the traditional Schatzker's classification, particularly in the multi planar and posteriorly extended plateau fractures. It can be used as a reliable research tool. The database can be used to distinguish different fracture types, individual type incidences, specific treatment and also prognosis. Authors suggest a large multi-centre study.

### Does loss of knee extension following operative treatment of tibial plateau fractures affect outcome? [^113XHyk5]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures are some of the most commonly treated injuries around the knee and loss of range of motion has a significant effect on post-operative outcomes, very few studies have demonstrated the impact of flexion contractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect that development of a knee flexion contracture has on outcomes following operative repair of tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

Patients operatively treated for tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker II, IV, V, and VI) between 2005–2024 at a multi-center academic urban hospital system were included in this retrospective comparative study. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: 1. Full extension (FE), 2. 5–10 degrees of flexion contracture (Mild, ME) and 3. Greater than 10 degrees of flexion (Severe, SE) contracture at 6 months post-operatively. Patients with contracture were matched to patients who regained full extension based on age and Schatzker classification. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate outcomes including patient reported pain levels, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) scores, complication rates and reoperation rates.

Results

The cohort consisted of 3 groups of 30 patients (14 Schatzker II, 5 Schatzker IV, 3 Schatzker V, and 8 Schatzker VI). The average knee flexion contracture for the mild cohort was 5 degrees and the average knee flexion contracture for the severe cohort was 12.7 degrees. Patients who experienced flexion contracture had poorer SMFA scores at 6 months, and those in the severe cohort had the poorest SMFA scores (112.6) when compared to those with full extension at 6 months (77.7) (p < 0.001). Flexion contractures were associated with higher rates of fracture related infection (FRI) (p = 0.002). Patients with flexion contracture also had a higher rate of subsequent re-operation, with 36.7% of the ME undergoing re-operation and 40% of SE undergoing re-operation.

Conclusions

Patients who developed a flexion contracture following repair of a tibial plateau fracture experienced worse outcomes, higher rates of complications, increased pain, and poorer function at long term follow up compared to those who achieved full knee extension.

### Functional outcome after nonoperative management of tibial plateau fractures in skeletally mature patients: what sizes of gaps and stepoffs can be accepted? [^115z51Wt]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Analysis of Nonparticipants

For the nonresponse analysis, we used an independent-samples t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for noncontinuous variables. The nonresponse analysis showed no differences in age between responders and nonresponders (53 ± 16 years versus 54 ± 20 years; p = 0.89). Women responded more often (70% [142 of 203] versus 59% [142 of 242]; p = 0.01). There was no difference in the mean stepoff between responders and nonresponders (2.1 ± 2.2 mm versus 1.9 ± 1.7 mm; p = 0.13). The mean gap was slightly smaller in the nonresponders group (2.1 ± 1.3 mm versus 1.7 ± 1.6 mm; p = 0.02). There was not much difference in fracture classification between responders and nonresponders (Schatzker I 18% [37 of 203] versus 11% [26 of 242]; Schatzker II 27% [54 of 203] versus 25% [61 of 242]; Schatzker III 39% [80 of 203] versus 35% [85 of 242]; Schatzker IV 12% [25 of 203] versus 16% [39 of 242]; Schatzker V 2% [4 of 203] versus 6% [15 of 242]; Schatzker VI 1% [3 of 203] versus 7% [16 of 242]). Also, there were few differences between responders and nonresponders in fracture classification according on the three-column concept (involvement of one column 58% [118 of 203] versus 52% [127 of 242]; two columns 35% [71 of 203] versus 36% [86 of 242]; three columns 7% [14 of 203] versus 12% [29 of 242]).

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^111WtPw9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures, which are typically caused by high-energy trauma or osteoporosis in older adults, comprise approximately 1% of all fractures. These fractures are typically characterized using the Schatzker system, in which fractures are classified as type I–VI, where type I is indicated by pure cleavage of the lateral plateau, type II is indicated by lateral splitting with depression, type III is indicated by pure depression of the lateral plateau, type IV is indicated by medial plateau fracture with or without an intercondylar fracture, type V is indicated by bicondylar fracture, and type VI is indicated by unicondylar or bicondylar tibial plateau fracture with an extension separating the metaphysis and diaphysis. Tibial plateau fractures are often complex (estimates suggest that 30–35% are bicondylar) and commonly occur with associated soft tissue injury. As such, treatment can be very challenging for the surgeon. Unsurprisingly, many different surgical techniques and approaches have been described for the management of tibial plateau fractures; however, there is a lack of clear definitive information in the literature as to which is the most appropriate technique.

As with any fracture, the aim of surgery in the management of tibial plateau fractures is to restore the normal anatomy, repair soft tissue injuries, and facilitate the return to normal physiological functioning. The two major surgical techniques currently employed for tibial plateau fractures are open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and arthroscopic-assisted reduction and internal fixation (AARIF). Being less invasive, AARIF has a clear advantage over ORIF. Evidence suggests that various complications, including pin tract and deep infection, loss of reduction, and septic arthritis are relatively common with ORIF. Of note, overall morbidity has been reported to be lower with AARIF compared with ORIF due to the decreased invasiveness of the approach. AARIF also allows for direct and precise examination of intra-articular lesions. As such, the use of AARIF has been advocated for the management of all tibial plateau fractures.

Over the last 10–15 years, the findings from a number of studies have been published reporting on outcomes following AARIF for the management of tibial plateau fractures. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of clinical outcomes and determine whether this may be a viable technique, a systematic review of the literature on arthroscopic management (all types) of tibial plateau fractures was carried out. Specifically, the review focused on identifying studies reporting clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as the occurrence of postoperative osteoarthritis.

### Computed tomography-based three-column classification in tibial plateau fractures: introduction of its utility and assessment of its reproducibility [^113Di3kN]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of our study is to introduce a new Three-Column Classification for tibial plateau fractures and evaluate its reproducibility and reliability.

Methods

From December 2004 to December 2006, 278 consecutive patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated operatively at the Department of Orthopedics and Trauma III in Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Computed tomography (CT) and three-dimensional reconstruction were preformed for each patient before open reduction and internal fixation. The approaches were instructed by the Three-Column Classification. To test the reproducibility of the Three-Column Classification, the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of this classification system compared with that of the Schatzker Classification was investigated by four observers.

Results

Fourteen cases could not be classified by Schatzker Classification. Meanwhile, all cases could be classified by the Three-Column Classification. Using plain radiographs, the mean κ values for interobserver reliability using Schatzker Classification systems were 0.567 (range, 0.513–0.589), representing "moderate agreement", whereas the mean κ values were 0.766 (range, 0.706–0.890), representing "substantial agreement" by the use of the Three-Column Classification based on the CT scan. The mean κ values for intraobserver reliability using Schatzker Classification and the Three-Column Classification based on the CT scan were 0.758 (range, 0.691–0.854) and 0.810 (range, 0.745–0.918), respectively, representing "substantial agreement".

Conclusion

The Three-Column Classification demonstrates a higher interobserver reliability and can be used as a supplement to the conventional Schatzker Classification, especially in the complex and posterior comminuted tibial plateau fractures. Furthermore, the Three-Column Classification is clinically relevant and, to some degree, can instruct the surgeon in preoperative planning.

### Surgical fixation methods for tibial plateau fractures [^115zcWxw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the tibial plateau, which are intra-articular injuries of the knee joint, are often difficult to treat and have a high complication rate, including early-onset osteoarthritis. Surgical fixation is usually used for more complex tibial plateau fractures. Additionally, bone void fillers are often used to address bone defects caused by the injury. Currently there is no consensus on either the best method of fixation or bone void filler.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different surgical interventions, and the use of bone void fillers, for treating tibial plateau fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (12 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014 Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1 2014), EMBASE (1974 to 2014 Week 36), trial registries (4 July 2014), conference proceedings and grey literature (4 July 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing surgical interventions for treating tibial plateau fractures and the different types of filler for filling bone defects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Only very limited pooling, using the fixed-effect model, was possible. Our primary outcomes were quality of life measures, patient-reported outcome measures of lower limb function and serious adverse events.

Main Results

We included six trials in the review, with a total of 429 adult participants, the majority of whom were male (63%). Three trials evaluated different types of fixation and three analysed different types of bone graft substitutes. All six trials were small and at substantial risk of bias. We judged the quality of most of the available evidence to be very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about these results. One trial compared the use of a circular fixator combined with insertion of percutaneous screws (hybrid fixation) versus standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in people with open or closed Schatzker types V or VI tibial plateau fractures. Results (66 participants) for quality of life scores using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function scores tended to favour hybrid fixation, but a benefit of ORIF could not be ruled out. Participants in the hybrid fixation group had a lower risk for an unplanned reoperation (351 per 1000 people compared with 450 in the ORIF group; 95% CI 197 fewer to 144 more) and were more likely to have returned to their pre-injury activity level (303 per 1000 people, compared with 121 in the ORIF group; 95% CI 15 fewer to 748 more). Results of the two groups were comparable for the WOMAC pain subscale and stiffness scores, but mean knee range of motion values were higher in the hybrid group. Another trial compared the use of a minimally invasive plate (LISS system) versus double-plating ORIF in 84 people who had open or closed bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Nearly twice as many participants (22 versus 12) in the ORIF group had a bone graft. Quality of life, pain, knee range of motion and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. The trial provided no evidence of differences in HSS knee scores, complications or reoperation entailing implant removal or revision fixation. A quasi-randomised trial comparing arthroscopically-assisted percutaneous reduction and internal fixation versus standard ORIF reported results at 14 months in 58 people with closed Schatzker types II or III tibial plateau fracture. Quality of life, pain and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. There was very low quality evidence of higher HSS knee scores and higher knee range of motion values in the arthroscopically assisted group. No reoperations were reported. Three trials compared different types of bone substitute versus autologous bone graft (autograft) for managing bone defects. Quality of life, pain and return to pre-injury activity were not reported. Only one trial (25 participants) reported on lower limb function, finding good or excellent results in both groups for walking, climbing stairs, squatting and jumping at 12 months. The incidences of individual complications were similar between groups in all three trials. One trial found no cases of inflammatory response in the 20 participants receiving bone substitute, and two found no complications associated with the donor site in the autograft group (58 participants). However, all 38 participants in the autologous iliac bone graft group of one trial reported prolonged pain from the harvest site. Two trials reported similar range of motion results in the two groups, whereas the third trial favoured the bone substitute group.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain the best method of fixation or the best method of addressing bone defects during surgery. However, the evidence does not contradict approaches aiming to limit soft-tissue dissection and damage or to avoid autograft donor site complications through using bone substitutes. Further well-designed, larger randomised trials are warranted.

### The long-term functional outcome of operatively treated tibial plateau fractures [^116Ahnnu]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the long-term functional results of the surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures using standard techniques of open reduction and internal fixation.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

University hospital.

Methods

Forty-seven displaced fractures of the tibial plateau in forty-six patients were treated with open reduction, interfragmental screw fixation of the articular fragments, and buttress plate fixation and had a minimum of five years of follow-up. All aspects of their care, including tibial plateau fracture type, operative management and associated injuries, were documented. Preoperative and postoperative follow-up radiographs were analyzed for fracture classification and adequacy of reduction. All patients were contacted and given functional outcome questionnaires using both a generic health status scale (Short Form 36 [SF-36]) (18) and a disability scale relating to knee osteoarthritis (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index [WOMAC]) (1). Data were also collected regarding return to work and sporting activities. Assessment scores were analyzed with respect to age, fracture type and severity, and were compared to standardized age and sex-matched scores for the healthy population. The average age of the patients at the time of injury was forty years and the average follow-up period was 8.3 years. Of the forty-seven fractures studied, twenty-five were classified as Schatzker types I, II, or III, and the remaining twenty-two were types IV, V, or VI (15). All fractures received operative treatment within forty-eight hours and all but five fractures were acceptably reduced.

Results

Compared to the standardized SF-36 categorical and aggregate scores, there was no statistically significant difference between the healthy age-matched population and twenty-four of twenty-six of the under-age-forty group regardless of fracture type. With regard to the over-age-forty group, scores statistically similar to the control population were found in only twelve of twenty-one patients. Although there was a large variance in WOMAC scores for all groups resulting in no statistically significant difference being found, a trend toward higher categorical and aggregate scores was seen with increasing age at presentation. There was no correlation between WOMAC scores and fracture type. Multiple-classifications analysis of all data revealed that presentation age was the most significant source of variation with respect to functional outcome. Fracture type had much less influence and adequacy of reduction had no significant influence on outcome, although the group of patients having an inadequate reduction by the authors' criteria was too small in number to reasonably comment upon.

Conclusions

Open reduction and internal fixation is a satisfactory technique for the treatment of displaced fractures of the tibial plateau, particularly for patients younger than forty years.

### Surgical fixation methods for tibial plateau fractures [^116Akv4d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tibial plateau fractures, which are intra-articular injuries of the knee joint, are often difficult to treat and have a high complication rate, including early-onset osteoarthritis. The most common treatment for complex tibial plateau fractures is surgical fixation. Additionally, orthopaedic surgeons often use bone defect fillers to address bone defects caused by the injury. Currently, there is no consensus on the best method of fixation and on whether bone defect fillers are necessary.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different surgical interventions and bone defect fillers for treating tibial plateau fractures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to March 2023. We also searched conference proceedings and the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing surgical interventions for treating tibial plateau fractures and different types of filler for bone defects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our primary outcomes (and the specific measures we considered most relevant) were generic quality of life (general health score in the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)), patient-reported lower limb function (Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score), and adverse events (frequency of unplanned reoperation). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 15 trials in the review, with a total of 948 adult participants. Nine trials compared different types of fixation, and six trials evaluated different types of bone graft substitutes. All 15 trials were small and at high risk of bias. We considered most available evidence to be of very low certainty, meaning we have very little confidence in the results. Only limited pooling was possible. One trial compared circular fixation combined with insertion of percutaneous screws (hybrid fixation) versus standard open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in 82 people with open or closed Schatzker types V or VI tibial plateau fractures. At 24 months' follow-up, hybrid fixation compared with ORIF may have little or no effect on SF-36 general health score (MD 6 points higher, 95% CI 7.7 points lower to 19.7 points higher; 66 participants), patient-reported lower limb function according to the HSS score (MD 7 points higher, 95% CI 2.4 points lower to 16.4 points higher; 66 participants), or frequency of unplanned reoperation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.32; 83 fractures (82 participants)). However, the evidence for all three outcomes is very uncertain. Three trials (with 242 participants) compared single-plating ORIF versus double-plating ORIF. There may be little to know difference in patient-reported lower limb function (HSS score) at 24 months' follow-up in people who undergo single-plating ORIF compared with those who undergo double-plating ORIF (MD 0.2 points higher, 95% CI 2.12 points lower to 2.52 points higher; 1 study, 84 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. There were no data for quality of life or unplanned reoperation at 24 months' follow-up. Six trials (including 368 participants) compared bone substitute versus autologous bone graft (autograft) for managing bone defects. No trials reported SF-36 general health score, HSS score, or frequency of unplanned reoperation at 24 months' follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to ascertain the best method of fixation or the best method of addressing bone defects during surgery in people with tibial plateau fractures. Further well-designed RCTs with larger sample sizes are warranted.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^114zMLj3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall Interobserver Agreement

Overall, 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures did not lead to categorical changes in any of the three classification systems. The Schatzker and AO/OTA classification showed a small improvement in interobserver agreement with the addition of 3D print models (Schatzker: κ conv = 0.514 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.539; p = 0.005; AO/OTA:κ conv = 0.359 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.372; p = 0.03). No differences in agreement were found in the Luo three-column concept (κ conv = 0.514 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.532; p = 0.08) (Table 2).

### Classification of tibial plateau fractures using 3DCT with and without subtraction of unfractured bones [^116uVtuC]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The addition of 3D CT scans for observers evaluating tibial plateau fractures decreases agreement and diagnostic accuracy, possibly due to obstruction of the view by unfractured bones (i.e., patella, fibula, and femur) in 3D reconstructions.

Questions/Purposes

This study compared (1) the interobserver agreement between (subgroups of) observers classifying 3DCT reconstructions of tibial plateau fractures according to Schatzker, Luo, and AO/OTA, (2) recognition of different fracture characteristics, and (3) the level of confidence on a scale from 0 to 10 with and without subtraction of the unfractured bones.

Methods

We selected twenty consecutive 3DCT reconstructions of tibial plateau fractures treated in a level I trauma center between 2013 and 2014. Members of the Science of Variation Group were randomized (1:1) to evaluate reconstructions with or without subtraction of the unfractured bone. Forty-nine surgeons completed the survey. The interobserver agreement was determined using Fleiss' kappa, and bootstrapping (resamples = 1000) was used to calculate the standard error, z statistic, and confidence intervals.

Results

Overall, subtraction of unfractured bones did not affect interobserver agreement in Schatzker, Luo, and AO/OTA classification systems, agreement on the presence of fracture characteristics, and level of confidence. In subgroup analysis, non-trauma surgeons had significantly higher agreement in the three classification systems with subtraction. For fracture characteristics, some subgroups had higher agreement while others had lower agreement with subtraction.

Discussion

The finding that agreement on classification of tibial plateau fractures is limited on 3DCT scan and is not improved by subtraction of unfractured bones suggests that disagreement may be based on variations in understanding and bias. Reliability of these classification systems might benefit from a focus on accounting for these pre-existing conceptualizations rather than further emphasis on imaging detail.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^112LbWsa]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the intra- and interobserver agreement for both fracture classification according to Schatzker and treatment plan of tibial plateau fractures using plain radiographs alone and with computed tomography (CT) scans. The study was carried out prospectively to assess the impact of an advanced radiographic study on the agreement of treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures. Eight experienced observers (six surgeons and two radiologists) classified 15 tibial plateau fractures with plain radiographs and CT scans and set up a treatment plan. Agreement was measured using kappa coefficients. Using plain radiographs alone, the mean interobserver kappa coefficient for classification was 0.47, which decreased to 0.46 after addition of CT scans. Using plain films alone for formulating a treatment plan, the mean interobserver kappa coefficient was 0.40, which decreased to 0.30 after addition of CT scans. The mean intraobserver kappa coefficient for fracture classification using plain radiographs was 0.60, which decreased to 0.57 with addition of CT scans. The mean intraobserver kappa coefficient for treatment plan based on plain radiographs alone was 0.53, which decreased to 0.45 after addition of CT scans. In contrast with other recent publications, there is no increase in inter- and intra-agreement of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures. Routine CT scanning of the knee for tibial plateau fractures is not supported by this study.

### Why address posterior tibial plateau fractures? [^113Lojs3]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of posterior tibial plateau fractures has gained much interest over the past few years. Fracture morphology, trauma mechanism, and soft-tissue injury have been identified as the key factors determining the treatment strategy and outcome. We provide a rationale for the operative management of posterior tibial plateau fractures by discussing the interplay between fracture morphology, trauma mechanism, and soft-tissue injury. The trauma mechanism has proven to be an important tool, not only to understand fracture morphology, but also to assess concomitant soft-tissue (i.e. ligamentous) injury. Subsequently, soft-tissue injury might play a role in future classification and diagnostic work-up of tibial plateau fractures, particularly in fractures with posterior involvement. Plate osteosynthesis using a posterior approach is safe and should be considered routinely in coronal fractures of the posterior tibial plateau, as illustrated.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^113M5yxQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Study Design

Based on the hospital's registration system for the diagnosis of tibial plateau fracture, 113 adult patients (≥ 18 years) with a tibial plateau fracture who were treated between June 2012 and June 2020 were identified for this observational study. Forty-four patients without a good-quality preoperative CT scan and those with a bone disease (such as osteoporosis or osteogenesis imperfecta) were excluded. Previous studies on the additional value of 3D-printed models were based on approximately 20 fractures and could not demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement. To ensure that observers could stay focused during the classification process and that a possible clinically relevant improvement could be achieved, we decided to include 40 patients with a tibial plateau fracture. Two nonobserver authors (JMH, NvdG) screened fractures before inclusion to ensure that the chosen fractures capture the main characteristics of the used classification systems. According to the Schatzker classification, we included two Type I plateau fractures, 13 Type II, two Type III, five Type IV, two Type V, and 16 Type VI.

Furthermore, we ensured that the different fracture types, according to the Schatzker classification, were equally divided into two groups by using a random number generator: a 3D-printed model group and a conventional radiology group (Table 1).

Table 1.

Image Viewer

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images of all fractures were retrieved using KPACS (version 1.6.0, IMAGE Information Systems Europe GmbH). DICOM files were anonymized using MATLAB® (version R2020a, the MathWorks Inc). The DICOM files of all radiographs, 2D CT images, and 3D CT images were presented using a Philips DICOM viewer (R3.0-SP03, Philips Medical Systems Nederland BV), Windows Photo Viewer, and Windows Media Player (Windows 7, Microsoft Corp).

### The pivotal role of the coronal fracture line for a new three-dimensional CT-based fracture classification of bicondylar proximal tibial fractures [^114wE4tQ]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Classical fracture classifications (AO/OTA, Schatzker) are commonly used to characterize bicondylar proximal tibial fractures. However, none of these classifications allows for a treatment algorithm. The aim of our study was to use 3D appearance of these fractures in CT imaging to improve the clinical value of the classification.

Materials and Methods

3D appearance of 81 CT scans of bicondylar proximal tibial fractures were systematically analyzed and were classified in 3 subtypes, based on the fracture lines orientation. The novel classification was compared for reliability and for clinical relevance with AO and Schatzker classification.

Results

A total of 159 fracture lines were identified which were most frequently oriented in sagittal (89/159), and in coronal (41/159) direction. Based on the orientation of the major fracture lines three fracture types were defined. A special emphasis was drawn to the coronal fracture line of the medial plateau leading to a surgical treatment algorithm. Interobserver reliability was analyzed for all 81 patients resulting in an excellent reliability of К = 0.936 for the 3D classification scheme compared to К = 0.720 for the AO/OTA, К = 0.785 for the Schatzker classification. Correlations with clinical parameters were only observed for the 3D classification.

Discussion

The presented classification scheme based on the 3D geometry of bicondylar proximal tibial fractures demonstrates a good reliability of clinical relevance.

### Interobserver reliability of the schatzker and luo classification systems for tibial plateau fractures [^114GTzZL]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fracture classification systems have limited interobserver reliability and new systems emerge. The purpose of this study was to compare the reliability of the Luo classification and the Schatzker classification for two-dimensional computed tomography (2DCT) and to study the effect of adding three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT).

Materials and Methods

Eighty-one observers, orthopedic surgeons and residents, were randomized to either 2DCT or 2D- and 3DCT evaluation of a spectrum of 15 complex tibial plateau fractures using web-based platforms in order to classify according to the Schatzker and according to Luo's Three Column classification. Reliability was calculated with the use of Siegel and Castellan's multirater kappa measure. Kappa values were interpreted according to the categorical rating by Landis and Koch.

Results

Overall interobserver reliability of the Schatzker classification was significantly better compared to the Luo classification (kSchatzker = 0.32 and kLuo = 0.28, P = 0.021), however, 'fair' for both fracture classification systems. For the Schatzker classification observers agreed significantly better on 2DCT compared to 2D- and 3DCT (k2DCT = 0.37 and k2D+3DCT = 0.29, P < 0.001). The addition of 3DCT did not improve the overall interobserver reliability for the Luo classification as well, as kappa values were not significantly different on 2DCT and 2D- and 3DCT (k2DCT = 0.31 and k2D+3DCT = 0.25, P = 0.096).

Conclusions

The agreement between observers was significantly better for the Schatzker classification compared to Luo's Three Column classification, however agreement was fair for both classification systems. Furthermore, the addition of 3DCT reconstructions did not improve the reliability of CT-based evaluation of tibial plateau fractures. Considering that new classification systems and 3DCT do not seem to improve agreement between surgeons, other efforts are needed that lead to more reliable diagnosis of complex tibial plateau fractures.

### Impact of MRI on treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures [^114zZpGq]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the interobserver agreement for both treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures using plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Design

Prospective study to assess the impact of an advanced radiographic study on the agreement of treatment plan and fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures among three orthopaedic surgeons.

Setting/Participants

Patients presenting with tibial plateau fractures to a level I trauma center were evaluated with plain knee radiographs (anteroposterior, lateral, two oblique views), CT scan, and MRI. Three experienced attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons were randomly presented three sets of studies for each injury: radiographs alone, radiographs with CT, and radiographs with MRI (including soft tissue injuries documented by an experienced MRI radiologist). The surgeons were asked to render fracture classification and treatment plan based upon the blind reading of each individual radiographic set.

Main Outcome Measures

Agreement among the three surgeons was measured using kappa coefficients.

Results

For fracture classification, radiographs alone yielded a mean kappa coefficient of 0.68, which increased to 0.73 for radiographs with CT scan and 0.85 for radiographs with MRI. Fracture classification (Schatzker) was changed an average of 6% with the addition of the CT scan and 21% based on radiographs with MRI. For the fracture management plan, the mean interobserver kappa coefficient for radiographs alone was 0.72, which increased to 0.77 for radiographs with CT scan and 0.86 for radiographs with MRI. MRI changed treatment plan in 23% of the cases.

Conclusion

Magnetic resonance imaging increases the interobserver agreement on fracture classification and operative management of tibial plateau fractures.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^114dmn56]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Proximal tibial fractures can disrupt knee joint mechanics, leading to uneven weight distribution and potentially worsening arthritis. Surgeons evaluate the MPTA and postoperative PPTA to ensure optimal alignment and reduce these risks. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the normal anatomical values of Joint Orientation Angles in Lower Extremity. In our study, the CREF group exhibited a slightly higher mean MPTA (87.24°) and a lower mean PPTA (91.41°) compared with the ORIF group, which had mean values of 87.09° and 93.64°, respectively. These differences reflect variations in surgical techniques and fixation methods between CREF and ORIF. Although our MPTA values were within the normal range, the PPTA values exceeded the upper limit of the normal range in both groups. Kulkarnee et al reported a median MPTA value of 86.9, which is similar to our findings, but their PPTA value of 79.8° was significantly better than ours. This underscores the importance of achieving proper anatomical alignment to optimize surgical outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of computed tomography scanning on the inter- and intra-observer reliability of the OTA/AO, the Schatzker, and the Hohl classifications in the assessment of tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

Four independent observers classified 45 consecutive fractures of the tibial plateau according to the criteria of the OTA/AO system, the Schatzker classification, and the Hohl classification. Two sessions of readings were compared; first, the use of plain anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays alone was evaluated, then 4 weeks later the combination of plain X-rays and two-dimensional computed tomography scans were evaluated. The readings were repeated 8 weeks later to evaluate intra-observer reliability.

Results

The three classification systems showed "moderate" inter-observer reliability and "good" and "moderate" intra-observer reliability when classified solely on the basis of plain radiographs. After the addition of computed tomography scans inter-observer reliability significantly improved to "good" in all classifications. Likewise, intra-observer reliability improved to "good" in all classifications after the addition of CT-scans. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference regarding inter- and intra-observer agreement between the three classifications.

Conclusions

Computed tomography scanning improved the inter- and intra-observer reliability of the OTA/AO, the Schatzker, and the Hohl classification. Overall, all three classification systems showed "good" inter- and intra-observer reproducibility when classified with CT-scans.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^113xAvpy]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
This flowchart shows the study's design.

From the five classification systems for tibial plateau fractures that have been tested for inter- and intraobserver reliability, three classification systems that represent a different level of simplicity were chosen for this study: the Schatzker classification, the AO/OTA classification, and the Luo three-column concept. Each observer was asked to classify the fractures according to these three systems. After viewing each fracture, participants indicated their overall confidence regarding their fracture assessment on a 10-point Likert scale, with 0 meaning not confident at all and 10 meaning completely confident.

To define a gold standard, a panel of three experienced trauma surgeons who had special expertise in knee surgery and 10 years to 25 years of experience in practice (EH, MJRE, and SvdG, a member of the Traumaplatform 3D consortium) classified all fractures according to the Schatzker classification, the AO/OTA classification, and the Luo three-column concept until consensus was reached. During this assessment, the surgeons had full access to preoperative radiographs, 2D and 3D CT images, 3D-printed models, operative reports, and postoperative radiographs of all fractures.

Data were collected using a questionnaire created in Castor EDC (v2020.2.11, Castor EDC). During fracture assessment, one of the authors (JMH, NvdG) was present to provide radiographs, CT images, and 3D-printed models of fractures and complete the questionnaire in Castor EDC.

Ethical Approval

We obtained approval from our institutional review board to perform this study.

Study characteristics

The key characteristics of the studies included in the systematic review are summarized in Table 1. Of the studies included, five were prospective studies and seven were retrospective studies. The number of patients included in the studies ranged from 10 to 54 (total = 353). The proportion of male patients in the studies ranged from 10.0 to 75.6%, with 7 of 12 studies including a majority (> 50%) of male patients. The mean age of patients ranged from 36 to 72 years, although the mean age of patients was in the 41–49 years 7 of 12 studies. The type of Schatzker fracture classification was variable between studies, although the majority of (or all) patients in most studies had type I–III fractures. All patients in the 2003 study reported by Chan et al. had type V or VI fractures, while the majority (> 50%) of patients in the 2008 study reported by Chan et al. had type IV–VI fractures. Alternative fracture classification systems (Association for Osteosynthesis/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation and AO-Müller/Orthopaedic Trauma Association) were used in the studies reported by Lobenhoffer et al. and Asik et al; the majority (≥ 89%) of patients in these two studies had type B1–B3 fractures. The type of graft material used varied between studies. The method of fixation most commonly used (8 of 12 studies) was screw fixation. The length of follow-up was reported in 11 of the 12 studies and ranged from a mean of 24–87 months. A length of follow-up from 34 to 38 months was reported in five studies.

### Evaluation and management of posterior tibial plateau fractures [^111ZFNqF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Tibial plateau fractures are caused by high-energy or low-energy trauma and result in complex injuries that require careful management of both osseous injuries and associated soft tissues. The posterior aspect of the tibial plateau can be involved in a variety of fracture patterns, requiring systematic evaluation, imaging, and advanced surgical planning to address these complex injuries. Early classification systems failed to classify posterior plateau fractures; however, three-dimensional imaging and newer classification schemes, including the Quadrant System and 3D systems, have incorporated posterior column lesions. There has been a growing body of literature focused on fixation principles and plating options for posterior column fractures. Furthermore, there are multiple approaches for surgeons to choose between, including a direct posterior, posteromedial, posterolateral (including Lobenhoffer and lateral condyle osteotomy), and combined posterior approach. This article presents a guide for managing posterior tibial plateau fractures, including the initial evaluation and management, descriptions of the surgical approaches, principles of fixation, and the associated outcomes and complications.

### Letter to the editor of: "posterior tibial plateau impaction fractures are not associated with increased knee instability: a quantitative pivot shift analysis" [^114NZdPD]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

With great interest we have read the recent publication of Godshaw et al. and their analysis of the association of the posterolateral tibial impression fracture (PLIF) and the pivot shift phenomenon. As the authors highlight, this topic has come into recent focus due to an increased understanding of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures and their potential association with outcome of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. The authors included 284 patients that were subdivided into a fracture and a non-fracture group. The fracture group was defined as "articular-impaction" or "displaced-articular fragment" with a displacement of at least 2 mm. The authors found no statistical difference among the three groups with respect to ap translation or pivot shift acceleration.

From the "ligament" point of view, multiple biomechanical and clinical studies have highlighted the association of a steep lateral tibial slope on the risk for ACL rupture, including numerous publications of the same study group.

From the "bony" point of view, thanks to the CT-morphological assessment of posterior fracture runs, modern classifications such as the ten-segment-, revisited Schatzker or updated-three-column classification have not only led to a paradigm shift in the surgical strategy, but also in the quality of reconstruction, not limited to posterolateral tibial plateau fractures. In addition, the presented findings stand in contrast to results of Flury et al. who showed that PLIF size matters with regard to ACL reconstruction outcome. Hence, we would like to address major limitations of the study and question its scientific value for this important issue that has still to be answered with appropriate measures.

First, given the high risk of malreduction and its impaired knee function in the treatment of PLIF, their treatment has received lots of scientific attention. Several established classifications have outdated the classifications named by the authors. There are numerous descriptions of posterolateral approaches resulting in specific concepts to address PLIF as needed. Hence, we strongly disagree with the authors' introductory statement that "almost all [of PLIF] heal" and "surgical fixation of these fragments is usually not performed".

### Clinical and radiological outcomes of schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures treated with internal fixation and external fixation [^112T9DSv]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrated that ORIF and CREF of proximal tibia fractures in LMIC gave similar results in terms of function at one year and overall complication rates. The CREF group had significantly shorter durations for operating time and lower blood loss compared with ORIF. Surgical site infections were the most common complications, and the overall complication rate was lower in the CREF group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

In the developing world, the population is predominantly composed of younger individuals who are frequently on the road. Because of cultural norms and societal roles, this demographic is predominantly male. As a result, our study reflects this distribution. With more men actively on the streets, there is a higher likelihood of exposure to high-energy trauma, such as RTAs. Therefore, the majority male population in our analysis aligns with the increased incidence of RTAs and other traumatic injuries.

Our analysis showed that patients who underwent CREF had shorter preoperative waiting times than those opted for ORIF. In the ORIF group, five patients waited 5 to 7 days presurgery for swelling to subside. High-energy fractures (Schatzker type V and VI) cause significant articular surface damage and soft-tissue edema. Operating on trauma patients in the ORIF group risks exacerbating swelling, as reported in the literature. For instance, Kulkarnee et al observed mean preoperative days ranging from 1 to 16 for ORIF-treated patients. Similarly, Pun et al reported waiting periods of 12 hours to 21 days, whereas Yao et al found a mean time of 7 to 14 days for ORIF-treated patients. By contrast, CREF requires minimal incisions and can be done even under suboptimal skin conditions.

### Cost reduction for knee-spanning external fixation in the staged treatment of tibial plateau fractures: a practical intervention [^111vbnNp]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether an educational intervention affects surgeon implant decision making measured by total implant costs for temporizing a knee-spanning external fixation construct.

Design

A total of 24 cases were prospectively collected after an educational intervention and matched to 24 cases before intervention using Schatzker classification and by surgeon.

Setting

A single Level 1 trauma center.

Patients/Participants

Forty-eight patients with Schatzker II-VI tibial plateau fractures.

Intervention

Education session to create transparency with component pricing and to provide 3 clinical cases of Orthopaedic Trauma Association/AO 41-C3 (Schatzker VI) with accompanying images and fixator construct costs. Total implant costs displayed in the session ranged from $2354 to $11,696.

Outcome Measurement

External fixator construct cost.

Results

The mean cost of constructs in the postintervention group was $4550.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) $3945.60-$5154.00], which was significantly different compared with the preintervention group cost of $6046.75 (95% CI = $5309.54-$6783.97, P = 0.003). After 1 year, the total implant costs of external fixation constructs were reduced by an average of almost $1500 per patient.

Conclusion

An educational intervention created a reduction in the average total implant construction costs for temporary knee-spanning external fixation in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Surgical implant selection and cost variance remain an ideal area to improve value for patients and hospitals. Empowering surgeons with knowledge regarding implant prices is a critical part of working toward the cost reductions of external fixation constructs.

### Three-dimensional computed tomography imaging increases the reliability of classification systems for tibial plateau fractures [^115zTFqZ]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images can improve intra-observer and inter-observer reliability for classification systems of tibial plateau fractures compared to plain radiographs and two-dimensional CT images.

Methods

Twenty-one tibial plateau fractures were classified independently by four attending orthopaedic trauma surgeons using the AO/ASIF and Schatzker classification systems. First, a combination of plain radiographs and two-dimensional (2D) CT images were evaluated. Second, 4 weeks later, plain radiographs and three-dimensional (3D) CT images were assessed. Then, 4 weeks later, these two rounds of evaluation were repeated. The intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were assessed using kappa statistics.

Results

Three-dimensional CT images can improve the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability regarding both AO/ASIF and Schatzker classification systems of tibial plateau fractures compared to 2D CT images. The degree of agreement of the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability among four surgeons increased from 'substantial' to 'almost perfect'.

Conclusion

Three-dimensional CT is a more reliable radiographic modality than 2D CT in evaluation of fracture patterns in tibial plateau fractures. This finding seems to show that more sophisticated imaging techniques can improve the reliability of fracture classification systems.

### The value of a CT scan compared to plain radiographs for the classification and treatment plan in tibial plateau fractures [^114HVgt7]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study did not show an increase in the inter- and intraobserver agreement for the fracture classification of tibial plateau fractures with the addition of a CT scan.

One would hypothesize that CT scans would improve observer agreement because fracture lines and details are more clearly shown on these images. Similar studies for the classification of proximal humeral or pelvic ring fractures, however, have also shown that CT scans did not improve interobserver agreement.

Brunner et al. recently published a study with four observers and 45 retrospectively selected consecutive patients that demonstrates a better interobserver agreement [kappa value for plain radiographs (0.42) vs. CT scan (0.76)] for classification of tibial plateau fractures with additional CT scans However, patients who did not had CT scans as part of the initial fracture management were excluded from this study, an aspect that might cause bias as a result of unequal selection of types. For example, the differentiation between a Schatzker type 1 and 2 is more difficult with plain radiographs than between a Schatzker type 1and 6 (Fig. 4). In contrast with Brunner, we selected the whole range of types of fractures twice. Compared with that study, our set of selected cases was smaller (15 vs. 45). However, we consulted more observers (8 vs. 4), increasing the reliability and validity of our study.

Fig. 4
The differentiation on AP plain radiographs, between Schatzker type 1 (a lateral split fracture) and type 2 (b lateral split fracture with depression) is more difficult than Schatzker type 1 and type 6 (c fracture with diaphysial discontinuity)

In a previous similar study by Yacoubian, with three observers, the agreement for classification of tibial plateau fractures changed from 0.68 to 0.73 with the additional information of the CT scan.

Another study by Chan, with six observers, also did not show an increase in agreement for classification of tibial plateau fractures with the addition of a CT scan (kappa: plain, 0.62; CT scan, 0.61).

A possible explanation, for the finding that an additional CT scan does not result in a better inter- and intraobserver agreement, is that the CT scan provides an overdose of information, which makes proper classification more difficult.

### Compartment syndrome in tibial plateau fractures: Do previously established predictors have external validity? [^113MeRoc]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test previously established radiographic predictors of compartment syndrome in tibial plateau fractures and determine whether novel measurements may further improve a surgeon's ability to identity patients at high risk for developing this outcome.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Academic Level I trauma center.

Patients

Five hundred thirteen patients with tibial plateau fractures treated operatively over a 10-year period (OTA/AO 41B1-3 & 41C1-3; Schatzker I-VI).

Intervention

Previously established plain film radiographic measurements and novel computed tomography soft tissue measurements.

Main Outcome Measure

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS).

Results

Schatzker VI fractures (odds ratio 5.72, confidence interval 2.55–12.83, P < 0.001), high-energy mechanism (3.10, 1.26–7.58, P = 0.0096), fibular fracture (8.14, 3.33–19.96, P < 0.0001), fracture length (9.70, 2.45–37.69, P = 0.0014), and plateau-shaft combined injury (2.97, 1.15–7.70, P = 0.019) were all associated with the development of compartment syndrome. The depth of the posterior compartment was also predictive of CS (1.06, 1.02–1.09, P = 0.0025). Patients with 3 and 4 predictive markers demonstrated a 20% and 27% chance of developing ACS respectively.

Conclusions

This study confirms that several factors are associated with the development of ACS. The presence of each independent predictor had a cumulative effect such that when more than one variable is present, the chance of ACS increases. This information may be used to alert providers regarding injuries that require vigilant evaluation.

### Proximal tibial intra-articular osteotomy for treatment of complex schatzker type IV tibial plateau fractures with lateral joint line impaction: description of surgical technique and report of nine cases [^1179sv7w]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2013). Low credibility.

This study presents a retrospective review of 8 patients with 9 cases of an uncommon variant of medial tibial plateau fracture treated with a surgical approach not previously described in the literature. The fracture pattern is characterized by a displaced medial tibial plateau fracture with significant central and posterior impaction of the lateral tibial articular surface but an intact lateral cortex. A novel surgical approach with an intra-articular osteotomy of the lateral tibial plateau was used to facilitate visualization, reduction, and instrumentation of the lateral articular injury. Early clinical and radiographic results of this treatment approach were reviewed. We describe the fracture pattern, surgical technique, and early results and propose this technique as a reasonable alternative for treatment of a challenging clinical entity.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^116e3CYa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Fracture classification

A difference in fracture classification between the L1 and L2 centres was observed for tibial plateau, tibial shaft, ankle, and foot fractures. The presentation of more complex tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker types 4–6), complex tibial shaft fractures, distal tibia fractures, displaced calcaneal fractures, talus fractures, and complex midfoot fractures (Chopart, Lisfranc, and navicular/nutcracker) was significantly greater in the L1 centre.

Ankle fractures were seen more frequently in the L2 centre and accounted for almost half of the total amount of fractures treated (n = 402, 41.1%), of which the majority were uni-malleolar fractures (72.4% within L2). Metatarsal fractures were also more often treated in the L2 centre (n = 362, 37.0%). A complete overview of the fracture distribution is shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Fracture classifications and complexity per level trauma centre

Fractures were more often associated with concomitant injuries in the L1 centre (p < 0.001) (e.g. soft tissue, vascular, and neurological damage). The L1 centre treated more open fractures (n = 72 or 13.4% versus n = 15 or 1.5%, p < 0.001) and more mangled extremities (n = 15 or 3% versus n = 0 or 0%, p < 0.001) than the L2 centre. Fracture characteristics are shown in Table 4.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^112YZMTG]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Interobserver Agreement Among Trauma Surgeons, Senior Surgical Residents, and Junior Surgical Residents

For junior surgical residents and senior surgical residents, 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures did not result in categorical changes in any of the three classification systems. Trauma surgeons demonstrated a categorical deterioration in the AO/OTA classification (κ conv = 0.426 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.338; p < 0.001). For trauma surgeons, no differences in agreement were found in the Schatzker classification and the Luo three-column concept (Schatzker: κ conv = 0.576 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.556; p = 0.44; Luo: κ conv = 0.506 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.555; p = 0.09) (Table 3). For senior surgical residents, 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures led to a small improvement in interobserver agreement in the Schatzker classification (κ conv = 0.494 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.551; p = 0.04). There were no differences in agreement in the AO/OTA classification and the Luo three-column concept (AO/OTA: κ conv = 0.372 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.372; p = 0.99; Luo: κ conv = 0.574 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.554; p = 0.56) (Table 4). For junior surgical residents, 3D-printed models led to an improvement in interobserver agreement in all three classification systems (Schatzker: κ conv = 0.443 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.566; p < 0.001; AO/OTA: κ conv = 0.282 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.324; p = 0.03; Luo: κ conv = 0.433 versus κ 3Dprint = 0.548; p < 0.001) (Table 5).

### Arthroscopy-assisted surgery for tibial plateau fractures [^114U7jLk]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to summarize the recent clinical outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopy-assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) for tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases was performed in January 2014. All English-language clinical studies on tibial plateau fractures treated with ARIF that were published after January 1, 2000 were eligible for inclusion. Basic information related to the surgery was collected.

Results

The search criteria initially identified 141 articles, and 19 studies were included in this systematic review. There were 2 retrospective comparative studies, 16 case series studies, and one clinical series based on a technique note. There were a total of 609 patients in this systematic review, with a mean follow-up time of 52.5 months. The most common fracture types were Schatzker types II and III. Concomitant injuries were common: 42.2% of the patients had meniscal injuries, and 21.3% had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. In addition, the status of 90.5% of the patients was classified as good or excellent according to the clinical Rasmussen scoring system, and 90.9% of the patients were satisfied with the treatment. Only 6 severe complications were reported, including one case of compartment syndrome.

Conclusions

ARIF is a reliable, effective, and safe method for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures, especially when they present with concomitant injuries.

Level Of Evidence

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^11363stE]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To carry out a systematic review of the literature on arthroscopic-assisted management (all types) of tibial plateau fractures to gain a more comprehensive understanding of clinical outcomes with this surgical technique, specifically to determine whether this may be a viable technique for the management of tibial plateau fractures.

Methods

MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched until July 2013 using combinations of the search terms: tibial plateau, fractures, and arthroscopically/arthroscopic/arthroscopy/percutaneous/minimally invasive. Inclusion criteria were observational study, patients with tibial plateau fractures, and clinical and radiological outcomes assessed using Rasmussen scoring system. The outcome measures of interest were clinical and radiological Rasmussen scores and the prevalence of secondary osteoarthritis.

Results

A total of 12 studies, 5 prospective and 7 retrospective, involving 353 patients were included in the review. The majority of patients in most studies had Schatzker type I–III fractures. The graft material used varied between studies. The length of the follow-up was typically between 34 and 38 months. Mean clinical Rasmussen scores ranged from 25.5 to 28.4. In each study, the majority (≥ 80%) of patients had excellent/good clinical Rasmussen scores. In each study, the majority (≥ 63%) of patients had excellent/good radiological Rasmussen scores. The proportion of patients who experienced secondary osteoarthritis was variable, ranging from 0 to 47.6%.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review indicate that arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures can be effective. Surgeons should consider using this approach when treating patients with tibial plateau fractures.

Level of evidence

### Open reduction and internal fixation in a one-stage anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures: a case report and literature review [^114B5TY2]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of tibial plateau fractures associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries can be challenging. Maintaining the joint surface and axis are two main principles for the management of patients with tibial plateau fractures. Herein, we describe a patient with tibial plateau fracture of Schatzker type VI associated with complete ACL rupture. Although in a two-stage reconstruction surgery for treatment of its rupture seem to be accepted by most orthopaedic surgeons in cases of ACL injuries, we treated our patient with ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction surgery. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient gained full range of motion and was functioning well. We reviewed the literature on performing ORIF in a one-stage ACL reconstruction for the treatment of tibial plateau fractures, which seemed to be a reasonable management approach that supported its use for the treatment of this patient.

### Operative treatment of 109 tibial plateau fractures: five-to 27-year follow-up results [^117WJmqB]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the long-term (5–27 years) functional and radiologic results of surgically treated fractures of the tibial plateau.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

University hospital.

Patients and Methods

Two hundred two consecutive tibial plateau fractures were included in this study. All fractures were classified according to both the AO and the Schatzker classification. There were 112 men and 90 women. The mean age at injury was 46 years (16 to 88). One hundred sixty-three patients had isolated fractures and 39 had multiple fractures. A 1 year follow-up was done in all 202 patients. One hundred nine of these patients also had an additional long-term follow-up visit. Functional results of these 109 patients were graded with the Neer- and HSS-knee scores. Radiologic results were graded with the Ahlbäck score. Statistical analysis was performed by means of the SPSS data analysis program.

Results

An uneventful union was present at the 1 year follow-up in 95% of the patients, along with a mean knee ROM of 130 degrees (range, 10–145 degrees). One hundred nine patients had a long-term follow-up visit after a mean period of 14 years (range, 5–27 years). The mean ROM at this time was 135 degrees (range, 0–145 degrees). Functional results showed a mean Neer score of 88.6 points (range, 56–100 points) and a mean HSS score of 84.8 points (range, 19–100 points). Monocondylar fractures showed statistically significant better functional results compared to bicondylar fractures. In 31% of the patients, secondary osteoarthritis had developed but was well tolerated in most (64% of the patients). Patients with a malalignment of more then 5 degrees developed a moderate to severe grade of osteoarthritis statistically significant more often (27% of the patients) compared to patients with an anatomic knee axis (9.2%; MWU, P = 0.02). Age did not appear to have any influence on the results.

Conclusion

Long-term results after open reduction and internal fixation for tibial plateau fractures are excellent, independent of the patient's age.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^114yJnUr]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The findings of this review (i.e.g.enerally satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes as determined by Rasmussen scores) are consistent with the findings from other studies not eligible for inclusion in this review in which different means of assessing clinical and radiological outcomes were used. For instance, Holzach et al. found that 14 of 16 (87.5%) patients with AO classification-type B2 and B3 fractures had excellent clinical outcomes as determined using the Davos Knee Scoring System and that 12 of 16 (75%) patients had anatomic alignment on radiography. Using the Hospital for Special Surgery knee score, Hung et al. found that 29 of 31 (93.5%) patients (generally with Schatzker type II–IV fractures) had satisfactory clinical outcomes and that all fractures exhibited union on radiography. In another study, Kiefer et al. found that 23 of 31 (74.2%) patients (predominantly with AO type B1–B3 fractures) had excellent or good Lysholm's knee function scores and that 25 of 31 (80.6%) patients had anatomic fracture reduction.

All but one of the studies included in this review were single-arm studies; hence, no remarks can be made concerning direct comparison between surgical techniques for the management of tibial plateau fractures, i.e. AARIF vs ORIF. Several studies not eligible for inclusion in this review because they did not report Rasmussen scores, however, have made such comparisons. Specifically, Ohdera et al. found that there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients who underwent AARIF vs those who underwent ORIF; however, postoperative rehabilitation was faster and a higher proportion of patients had anatomic reduction with AARIF compared with ORIF. In another comparative study, Fowble et al. similarly found that the proportion of patients with anatomic reduction was much higher for AARIF (12 of 12; 100%) compared with ORIF (6 of 11; 55%). The average length of postoperative hospitalization and time to full-weight bearing were both shorter among patients who underwent AARIF. These patients also experienced fewer and less severe complications. These findings support the notion that AARIF provides more benefits to patients than ORIF for the management of tibial plateau fractures.

### A nomogram predicting risk for acute compartment syndrome following tibial plateau fractures. single centre retrospective study [^1146i6rR]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background This study aimed at analysing risk factors for development of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) in tibial plateau fractures, and to construct a nomogram predicting ACS-risk. Patients and Methods 243 patients (102 males; mean age: 50.7 [range: 18–85] years) with 253 tibial plateau fractures treated between 2010 and 2019 at a level-1 trauma centre were retrospectively included. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis with odds ratios (OR) were performed to assess variables predicting ACS. Based on the multivariate model, ROC curve, Youden index, and nomogram were constructed. Results ACS developed in 23 patients (9.1%), with risk factors being male gender (OR: 10.606; p < 0.001), BMI (OR: 1.084; p = 0.048), polytrauma (OR: 4.085; p = 0.003), and Schatzker type IV-VI fractures (OR: 6.325; p = 0.004). Age, ASA score, diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension, smoking or open fracture were not significantly associated with ACS-risk (all p > 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, male gender (OR: 7.392; p = 0.002), and Schatzker type IV-VI fractures (OR: 5.533; p = 0.009) remained independent negative ACS-predictors, irrespective of polytrauma (p = 0.081), or BMI (p = 0.194). Area under the ROC curve was 0.840. Youden index revealed a cut-off value of ≥ 18%, upon which patients are at extremely high risk for ACS. Conclusions Particular attention should be paid to male patients with high-energy fractures of the tibial plateau towards any signs of ACS of the affected extremity to initiate early treatment. The compiled nomogram, consisting of four easily quantifiable clinical variables, may be used in clinical practice to individually predict ACS risk. Any risk score ≥ 18% should prompt critical monitoring towards ACS, or even prophylactic fasciotomy during primary surgery.

### Skiers and snowboarders have improved short-term outcomes with immediate fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^112kLiXw]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined adult patients (≥ 18 years) who underwent ORIF to repair a TPF between 2010 and 2013. Data were retrospectively obtained from a Level III Trauma Center that serves as the regional trauma center for four major ski resorts. Patients were identified from TraumaBase© (Conifer, Colorado), a trauma registry where dedicated registrars prospectively collect data on all traumatic injuries. Demographics, clinical characteristics, time between injury and ORIF and in-hospital outcomes were obtained from the trauma registry. Imaging was reviewed by three providers (PCJ, JLP, PJA) to evaluate the fracture patterns using the Schatzkerand AO/OTAclassification systems. This study was approved by the hospital's institutional review board.

The primary study population (figure 1) was identified by first using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes for TPF (823.00, 823.02, 823.10 and 823.12) and the ORIF procedure code (79.36; n = 156). Snow sport participants were defined as patients injured while skiing or snowboarding; patients were excluded for other injury causes (n = 12). The primary exposure variable was time from injury to ORIF classified as immediate (≤ 24 hours post-injury) and delayed (> 24 hours post-injury). Various time points defining immediate treatment intervals were found in the literature; our cut-point was chosen a priori based on physician suggestion. At this hospital, there is no institutional standardized protocol for the timing at which ORIF is to be performed and instead is physician and circumstance dependent. External fixators were placed in the majority of the patients treated in the delayed group. However, some patients with delayed treatment may have been simply placed in a knee immobilizer or splint, without external fixation, and returned to the operating room (OR) for further definitive fixation or further debridement of fasciotomies before definitive fixation could be done. Patients with an unknown time between injury and ORIF were excluded from the analysis (n = 2). We also excluded patients with a non-isolated TPF (n = 9), defined as: (1) an Abbreviated Injury Scale greater than 1 for any region of the body other than the leg and/or (2) patients with pelvic or femur injuries. The patients with non-isolated fracture were excluded to maintain similar overall injury severities between groups and to exclude patients in which immediate ORIF may have been contraindicated or unfeasible due to other injuries requiring urgent attention. Finally, 14 patients were excluded after the imaging review for only having postoperative X-rays or CT scans (n = 9) or having a tibial spine rather than plateau fracture (n = 5).

### Radiographic predictors of compartment syndrome in tibial plateau fractures [^113XPpyk]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this article was to evaluate the relationship of radiographic features of tibial plateau fractures to the development of compartment syndrome. We hypothesized that the direction and degree of initial displacement of the femur on the tibia, and the amount of tibial widening (TW), were correlated with the development of compartment syndrome.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

Single level 1 trauma center.

Patients

Retrospective evaluation of 158 patients with 162 plateau fractures.

Intervention

Grouping with and without compartment syndrome.

Main Outcome Measures

The following data were obtained: age, sex, Schatzker and OTA/AO classification, open/closed status, TW, and femoral displacement (FD). A univariate statistical and a logistical regression analysis were performed to determine significance.

Results

The overall rate of compartment syndrome was 11%. Univariate analysis found both the TW and FD to be significant with respect to development of compartment syndrome (P < 0.05). Higher Schatzker (IV-VI) and OTA/AO grades were also correlated (P < 0.05) with increased incidence of compartment syndrome. Logistic regression found FD and Schatzker grade to be significant.

Conclusions

Our study is the first to identify easily obtained radiographic parameters that correlate to the occurrence compartment syndrome. There may also be a relationship between TW and FD, as noted by regression result. This study helps to assess which patients with a fracture are at higher risk for developing a compartment syndrome.

### Mid-to long-term functional outcome after open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^116A6ybe]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tibial plateau fractures account for approximately 1% of all fractures. They usually occur after a direct high-energy trauma. Despite adequate treatment, these fractures can result in malalignment and secondary osteoarthritis (OA). Research concerning long-term functional outcome is limited. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate mid- to long-term functional outcome of surgically treated tibial plateau fractures. The secondary aim was to investigate whether radiological characteristics of OA one year after surgery are predictive of functional outcome at follow-up.

Methods

All consecutive patients with fractures of the proximal tibia, which were surgically treated in our level-2 trauma centre between 2004 and 2010, were included in this study. Initial trauma radiographs were analysed for fracture classification, using both the Schatzker and AO/OTA classification systems, by three different raters. Immediate postoperative and 1-year postoperative radiographs were analysed for osteoarthritis by an experienced radiologist, using the Kellgren and Lawrence scale. Functional outcome of the included patients was measured using the Dutch version of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire.

Results

Seventy one patients out of a group of 96 included patients completed the survey. Median KOOS scores are 89.8% for pain, 91.1% for 'other symptoms', 89.7% for daily function, 72.5% for sports and recreation and 75.0% for quality of life. Median KOOS overall score is 82.99%. We did not find a correlation between the KOOS scores and the absolute age for any of the subscales. There was no significant relationship between radiological characteristics of osteoarthritis and functional outcome.

Conclusions

This is the first study to describe mid- to long-term functional outcome after ORIF for all types of tibial plateau fractures, with the use of the KOOS. Patients should be informed about the likelihood of lower functional outcome in the long-term. This study shows that radiological characteristics of osteoarthritis are not related with lower functional outcomes in the mid- to long-term.

### Two-dimensional and three-dimensional computed tomography for the classification and characterisation of tibial plateau fractures [^112LK6pD]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Complex tibial plateau fractures can be difficult to characterise on plain radiographs and two-dimensional computed tomography (2D CT). The present study evaluated whether three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstructions can improve the reliability of complex tibial plateau fracture characterisation and classification.

Methods

Forty-five consecutive intra-articular fractures of the tibial plateau were evaluated by six independent observers for classification according to standard systems and for the presence of six characteristics: (1) posteromedial shear fracture; (2) coronal plane fracture; (3) lateral condylar impaction; (4) medial condylar impaction; (5) tibial spine involvement; and (6) separation of tibial tubercle necessitating fixation. Two rounds of characterisation and classification were performed: the first classification after a combination of plain radiographs and 2D CT and the second one after 3D CT information were added.

Results

3D CT improved the average 'inter'-observer reliability of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification (κ2D = 0.536, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.481–0.591 vs. κ3D = 0.545, 95% CI: 0.478–0.612), the Hohl and Moore classification (κ2D = 0.668, 95% CI: 0.605–0.732 vs. κ3D = 0.746, 95% CI: 0.605–0.732) and of the Schatzker classification (κ2D = 0.545, 95% CI: 0.494–0.596 vs. κ3D = 0.596, 95% CI: 0.538–0.654). 'Intra'-observer reliability also improved non-significantly for all systems after the addition of 3D CT for individual observers. 3D CT did improve the 'intra'-observer reliability for the identification of the following fracture characteristics: coronal plane fracture (average κ2D = 0.700, interquartile range (IQR): 0.551–0.820 vs. average κ3D = 0.774, IQR: 0.692–0.847); lateral condylar impaction (average, κ2D = IQR: 0.675–0.901 to 1.000 vs. average, κ3D = 0.785, IQR 0.737–0.807); medial condylar impaction (average κ2D = 0.631, IQR: 0.537–0.670 vs. κ3D = 0.719, IQR: 0.679–0.895); tibial spine involvement average (κ2D = 0.621, IQR 0.545–0.678 vs. average κ3D = 0.705, IQR: 0.652–0.794); separation of tibial tubercle necessitating fixation (average κ2D = 0.332, IQR: 0.080–0.574 vs. average κ3D = 0.441, IQR: 0.325–0.681). The only improvement that was found to be statistically significant was for recognition of medial condylar impaction as the IQR did not overlap. 3D CT had limited influence on average 'inter'-observer reliability for the recognition of all specific fracture characteristics (κ2D = 0.488 vs. κ3D = 0.485, both moderate agreement for all fracture characteristics) but showed a non-significant improvement of the recognition of coronal plane fractures (fair to moderate; κ2D = 0.398, 95% CI: 0.273–0.523 to κ3D = 0.418, 95% CI: 0.262–0.574) and recognition of impaction of the lateral condyle (κ2D = 0.614, 95% CI: 0.467–0.760 to κ3D = 0.693, 95% CI: 0.538–0.849).

Conclusions

The added value of 3D CT after 2D CT is limited and does not significantly improve reliability of characterisation and classification of tibial plateau fractures.

### Differentiation in an inclusive trauma system: allocation of lower extremity fractures [^113KL8BV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation and specialisation leads to optimization of care. Although there is a diversity in injury type with regard to the complex injuries, the required treatment regime, necessary resources, and flexible logistics make acute complex care of lower extremity fractures a separate entity that requires its own differentiation. Complex lower extremity fracture types were more frequently treated in the L1 centre. Tibial plateau Schatzker types 4 through 6, complex tibial shaft, displaced calcaneal, and complex midfoot fractures were more prevalent in the L1 compared to the L2 centre (Table 3). It is tempting to speculate that these fractures are more frequently the result of high-energy mechanisms and therefore predisposed to presentation to an L1 centre. This is supported by trauma mechanism analysis, as all high incidence complex fracture types in the L1 were related to HET mechanisms, such as a fall from height (e.g. suicide attempts), traffic, and crush mechanisms. This is further illustrated by a higher incidence of open fractures, an increased need for external fixations, fasciotomies, amputations, and other secondary or complication surgeries in the L1 centre. Open lower extremity fractures have a greater likelihood of infection, which makes early soft tissue coverage within hours to days desirable. Vascular damage and neurological damage ought to be treated urgently. Furthermore, soft tissue damage especially in the case of multiple non-contiguous fractures often requires serial operations. As a result, there is a high demand on multiple resources in the L1 centre. In total, 24.9% of all fractures in the L1 required more than one operation. In contrast, only 1.4% of the patients in the L2 centre underwent multiple procedures. The presence of an in-hospital trauma surgeon as well as a dedicated OR team for complex and severely traumatized patients was initiated to improve outcomes, but adds to the costs incurred per patient. Although not all secondary and complication-related surgeries were performed during the initial hospitalization, also in a semi-acute setting, they put pressure on OR capacity and require personnel with a high level of expertise. OR utilization is one of the costliest components in secondary care. As a consequence, treatment of the complex extremity injuries is expensive.

### Neurovascular injuries in tibial plateau fractures: rare in schatzker IV, predominant in complex patterns [^114ubK9r]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurovascular complications after tibial plateau fractures are rarely reported, despite their clinical relevance. While Schatzker type IV fractures have traditionally been considered the most at risk, supporting evidence is limited. This is the first large-scale study systematically evaluating neurovascular injuries in tibial plateau fractures. The aim was to determine the incidence of arterial and neurological injuries and to identify fracture patterns most frequently associated with these complications.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation for tibial plateau fractures at a level I trauma center between January 2015 and December 2023. Eligible patients had complete records, radiographs, CT angiography, and ≥ 12 months follow-up. Fractures were classified using both Schatzker and AO/OTA systems. Arterial injury was defined as a CT angiography confirmed lesion requiring surgical repair, and neurological injury as a motor or sensory deficit documented clinically or by electromyography within 1 month.

Results

A total of 320 patients were included (mean age 44.3 years; 71.3% male). Vascular injury occurred in 2 cases (0.62%), both high-energy open fractures classified as Schatzker VI and AO/OTA C3. Five additional patients (1.56%) had arterial occlusions without rupture or clinical ischemia, all of which resolved without surgery. Neurological injury was observed in 13 patients (4.06%), 84.6% related to high-energy trauma. Ten cases corresponded to Schatzker VI, predominantly AO/OTA C3 (n = 8). No neurovascular complications occurred in Schatzker IV fractures. Proximal fibular fracture was present in 61.5% of neurological cases with a OR of 4.46 (CI 1.41–14.03, p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Neurovascular complications in tibial plateau fractures are uncommon (< 5%) but are associated with high-energy, open, and complex patterns, particularly Schatzker VI and AO/OTA C3. Contrary to traditional belief, Schatzker IV fractures were not associated with neurovascular compromise. Proximal fibular fracture may serve as a clinical marker for neurological risk. CT angiography should not be performed routinely, but is especially recommended in open and high-energy fractures. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these associations and optimize imaging strategies.

### Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of classifications of tibial plateau fractures and the surgical approaches chosen comparing 2D CT and 3D printing: reliability study [^113WVdkj]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The type of instrument used affects reliability, whether using kappa or the intraclass correlation coefficient. In this study, the use of images such as 2D CT and 3D printing resulted in better reproducibility values than radiography. The use of 3D printing models by this reliability study is a strength because it provides better information and aids in decision-making by decreasing interpretation errors.

Reliability studies of the classification of tibial plateau fractures have used instruments such as plain radiography. In addition, Schatzker AO/OTAobtained intraobserver kappa values that were between moderate (0.41–0.60) and substantial (0.61–0.80). Studies that use 2D or 3D printing improve intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility, with kappa values between slight (0.00–0.20) when evaluating 2D CT scans and moderate (0.41 a 0.60) when evaluating 3D printing models. Furthermore, the kappa value for intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility has been reported to be better with 3D printing.

Normally, the kappa value for interobserver reliabilityis not high for the different classifications of fractures, ranging from 0.3 (fair) to 0.7 (substantial). The interpretation of reliability depends on the context of the evaluator and the instrument used for its evaluation in the clinical practice. In addition, high reliability does not indicate high precision.

Innovations in diagnostic imaging have helped with clinical and surgical decisions, which has benefited the treatment of tibial plateau fractures and decreased measurement error in reliability studies.

The 3D printing provides more information, facilitating planning and decision-making for tibial plateau fractures, which are more complex because of the increased energy that they cause. Furthermore, reliability as represented by intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility results in higher and more reproducible kappa using 3D printing coefficient values.

### Tibial plateau fracture characteristics: computed tomography mapping of lateral, medial, and bicondylar fractures [^115UfyyH]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Computed tomography (CT) is seen as a useful diagnostic modality in preoperative planning for tibial plateau fractures. The purpose of this study was to characterize patterns of tibial plateau fractures with use of CT mapping. We hypothesized that CT mapping of fractures of the tibial plateau would reveal recurrent patterns of fragments and fracture lines, including patterns that do not fit into Schatzker's original classification.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-seven tibial plateau fractures were retrospectively included in this study. Fracture lines and zones of comminution were graphically superimposed onto an axial template of an intact subarticular tibial plateau to identify major patterns of fracture and comminution. This fracture map of the tibial plateau was subsequently divided into lateral (Schatzker types I, II, and III), medial (Schatzker type IV), and bicondylar (Schatzker types V and VI) fracture maps.

Results

This study included seventy-three female and fifty-four male patients (average age, forty-seven years [range, seventeen to ninety-one years]) with a tibial plateau fracture. Sixty-four of the fractures were Schatzker type I, II, or III; fifteen were Schatzker type IV; and forty-eight were Schatzker type V or VI. Analysis of the fracture maps suggested patterns in the Schatzker type-IV, V, and VI fractures beyond those described in Schatzker's original classification. The maps of the 127 fractures revealed four recurrent major fracture features: the lateral split fragment (A), found in 75%; the posteromedial fragment (B), seen in 43%; the tibial tubercle fragment (C), seen in 16%; and a zone of comminution that included the tibial spine and frequently extended to the lateral condyle (D), seen in 28%.

Conclusions

Tibial plateau fracture maps show recurrent patterns of fracture lines, revealing four major fracture characteristics. An understanding of these recurrent features of tibial plateau fractures can aid surgeons during diagnosis, preoperative planning, and execution of surgical strategies.

### Medial sided articular impaction in tibial plateau fractures [^113a3ejV]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures are a heterogenous group of injuries with a variable amount of articular injury and are commonly associated with lateral sided articular impaction. Previous work has focused on describing the morphology of tibial plateau fractures, but has neglected description of medial sided articular impaction. The aim of this investigation was to assess the morphology of medial sided articular impaction in tibial plateau fractures, with specific attention directed toward the frequency, location, size, and associated fracture patterns.

Methods

Skeletally mature patients presenting to a Level I trauma center from 2008–2018 with a tibial plateau fracture (AO/OTA 41B-C) were identified retrospectively. Fractures were classified by AO/OTA and Schatzker type. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed to identify and localize medial sided articular impaction. The location and surface area of impaction was characterized by creating frequency diagram heat maps from axial CT scans. Descriptive statistics were performed using standard measures.

Results

Of the 1032 tibial plateau fractures included, 82 (7.9%) were noted to have medial sided articular impaction. Rate of impaction varied by fracture type (p = 0.03): Schatzker II, 2% (7 of 381); Schatzker IV, 21% (19 of 96); and Schatzker VI, 11% (56 of 524). Average total surface area of impaction was 9% of the total and 19% of the medial plateau area. Area of impaction varied by fracture type (p = 0.004): Schatzker II, 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4%-7%); Schatzker IV, 11% (95% CI, 9%-13%), and Schatzker VI, 9% (95% CI, 7%-11%). The area of impaction occurred primarily along the lateral aspect of the medial plateau in Schatzker II fractures, in the anteromedial quadrant of Schatzker IV fractures, and was evenly distributed across the medial plateau in Schatzker VI fractures.

Conclusions

Surgeons should be aware that medial articular impaction is present in approximately 8% of tibial plateau fractures. Schatzker IV fractures are most likely to have medial impaction and a larger proportion of the joint surface involved in these injuries.

### Assessment of proximal tibial fractures with 3D FRACTURE (fast field echo resembling a CT using restricted echo-spacing) MRI-intra-individual comparison with CT [^113aipcZ]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inter-reader agreement across the whole cohort was excellent (Krippendorff's alpha 0.89–0.96), and when considering only patients with fractures, acceptable (0.48–0.91), i.e. comparable to what was reported for CT. For example, inter-reader agreement on three-dimensional CT imaging of proximal tibial fractures varies considerably, ranging from fair to moderate to good with kappa values of 0.36–0.76 for the Schatzker classification, 0.23–0.83 for the OA/OTA classification, and only 0.27 for the 10-segment classification. In summary, a clear picture of the value of the different classifications does not emerge. For example, Maripuri et al concluded that none of the classification systems are ideal, however, the Schatzker classification was superior to the AO/OTA classification both in terms of inter- and intra-observer agreement.

### What's new in the management of complex tibial plateau fractures? [^115zNN3B]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

The management of complex tibial plateau fractures is ever evolving. The severity of the injury to the surrounding soft tissues influences the timing and the method of fixation. Minimal invasive techniques continue to dominate our philosophy of reduction and reconstruction whereas augmentation of depressed intra-articular fragments remains an accepted strategy to maintain reduction and prevent secondary collapse. Locking plates, conventional plates and fine wire fixators all have been used successfully with satisfactory outcomes. In this article we report on the latest advances made in the management of these complex injuries.

### Radiographic predictors of compartment syndrome occurring after tibial fracture [^11232xHC]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Compartment syndrome (CS) is a potentially devastating injury associated with tibial fractures. Few data exist regarding radiographic indicators of CS. We hypothesized that radiographic signs are associated with development of CS.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Level I trauma center.

Patients

Consecutive series of adult patients with tibial fractures with (n = 56) and without (n = 922) CS.

Intervention

None.

Outcomes

AO/OTA fracture classification, Schatzker type, fracture length, fibular fracture, CS diagnosis.

Results

The odds of CS increased by 1.67 per 10% increase in the ratio of fracture length to tibial length when considering all fractures. CS was most likely to occur with plateau fractures at 12% (shaft fractures, 3%; pilon fractures, 2%). Schatzker VI fractures were more likely to develop CS than any other Schatzker type. Fibular fracture was predictive of CS with plateau fractures only. Segmental fractures (AO/OTA type 42-C2) were not more likely to develop CS than other shaft fractures.

Conclusions

Several objective and easily reproducible radiographic indicators should raise suspicion for CS. CS was more likely in plateau fractures, especially when fracture length was > 20% of the tibial length, in the presence of fibular fracture, and classified as Schatzker VI. Conversely, segmental tibial shaft fractures were not more likely than other shaft fractures to develop CS.

Level Of Evidence

Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Cost variation in temporizing external fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^1174Z8MJ]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rising health care expenditures and declining reimbursements have generated interest in providing interventions of value. The use of external fixation is a commonly used intermediate procedure for the staged treatment of unstable fractures. External fixator constructs can vary in design and costs based on selected component configuration. The objective of this study was to evaluate cost variation and relationships to injury and noninjury characteristics in temporizing external fixation of tibial plateau fractures. We hypothesize that construct costs are highly variable and present no noticeable patterns with both injury and noninjury characteristics.

Methods

A retrospective review of tibial plateau fractures treated with initial temporizing external fixation between 2010 and 2016 at 2 Level I trauma centers was conducted. Fracture and patient characteristics including age, body mass index, AO/OTA classification, and Schatzker fracture classification were observed with construct cost. In addition, injury-independent characteristics of surgeon education, site of procedure, and date of procedure were evaluated with construct cost. Factors associated with cost variation were assessed using nonparametric comparative and goodness-of-fit regression tests.

Results

Two hundred twenty-one patient cases were reviewed. The mean knee spanning fixator construct cost was $4947 (95% confidence interval = $4742-$5152). The overall range in construct costs was from $1848 to $11,568. The mean duration of use was 16.4 days. No strong correlations were noted between construct cost and patient demographics (r = 0.02), fracture characteristics (r = 0.02), or injury-independent characteristics (r = 0.10). Finally, there was no significant difference between constructs of traumatologists and other orthopaedic surgeon subspecialists (P = 0.12).

Conclusions

Temporizing external fixation of tibial plateau is a high-cost intervention per unit of time and exhibits massive variation in the mean cost. This presents an ideal opportunity for cost savings by reducing excessive variation in implant component selection.

Level Of Evidence

Level III. Retrospective Cohort.

### What is the patient-reported outcome and complication incidence after operative versus nonoperative treatment of minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures? [^116Yqw5G]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Image Review and Gap and Stepoff Measurements

All knee radiographs and CT images that were taken at the time of injury were reassessed through consensus by an attending orthopaedic trauma surgeon (FFAIJ, > 10 years of experience) and technical physician (NA, > 5 years of experience). Fracture classification was determined according to the AO/OTA and 10-segment classification system. Based on fracture characteristics, the AO/OTA classification classifies intra-articular tibial plateau fractures into different types of fractures: partial articular fractures (B1: pure split, B2: pure depression, B3: split-depression) or complete articular fractures (C1: simple articular and metaphyseal, C2: articular simple and metaphyseal multifragmentary, C3: articular multifragmentary). The 10-segment classification divides the plateau into 10 segments; more involvement of segments indicate a more extensive fracture.

Preoperative CT images were reassessed in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes; in addition, gap and stepoff measurements were performed on the CT slice where displacement was found to be the highest. Gap was defined as separation of fracture fragments along the articular surface, and stepoff was characterized as separation of fracture fragments perpendicular to the articular surface. For each patient, the maximum value of the gap and stepoff on any of the axial, coronal, or sagittal CT slices is reported. To assess the impact of gap and stepoff separately, a subanalysis was performed in which patients were divided into four groups based on the size of their maximum gap and stepoff: patients with a gap and stepoff less than 2 mm, patients with a gap between 2 and 4 mm and stepoff less than 2 mm, patients with a stepoff between 2 and 4 mm and gap less than 2 mm, and patients with a gap and stepoff between 2 and 4 mm (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Based on their gap and stepoff, patients were divided into four groups: stepoff between 2 and 4 mm and gap less than 2 mm (upper left), gap and stepoff between 2 and 4 mm (upper right), gap and stepoff less than 2 mm (lower left), and gap between 2 and 4 mm and stepoff less than 2 mm (lower right). This illustrates the different combinations of sizes of gaps and stepoffs that are considered minimally displaced fractures.

### Arthroscopic-assisted reduction with bilateral buttress plate fixation of complex tibial plateau fractures [^112F3boX]. Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to determine the outcome of arthroscopic-assisted reduction with bilateral buttress plate fixation for the treatment of closed complex tibial plateau fractures.

Type Of Study

Case series.

Methods

18 consecutive patients (12 men, 6 women) with complex tibial plateau fractures were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent arthroscopic-assisted bilateral buttress plate fixation of closed complex tibial plateau fractures. The average age at operation was 35 years (range, 23 to 45 years). The follow-up period ranged from 39 to 69 months, with an average of 48 months. Using the Schatzker classification, there were 11 type V and 7 type VI fractures. The clinical and radiological outcomes were determined according to Rasmussen's system.

Results

All of the 18 fractures united. Overall, 4 (22%) patients were rated as excellent, 12 (67%) good, and 2 (11%) fair. Secondary osteoarthritis appeared in 3 injured knees (16.7%). One patient had a wound dehiscence (3 cm long) of the medial incision. Condylar joint surface depression was noted in 3 patients without functional instability. Two patients had valgus alignment between 10 degrees and 15 degrees. Two patients had the paresthesia over the lateral calf. There were no complications directly associated with arthroscopy in any of the 18 patients. No deep vein thrombosis, infection, or knee stiffness was found at final follow-up.

Conclusions

Arthroscopic-assisted reduction with bilateral buttress plate fixation for complex tibial plateau fractures allows accurate fracture reduction, diagnosis, and treatment of associated intra-articular lesions, and less dissection than open reduction internal fixation.

### Association of tibial plateau fracture morphology with ligament disruption in the context of multiligament knee injury [^111RhKCK]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We identified common morphologies of tibial plateau fractures that arise with multiligament knee injuries (MLKIs), and investigated the relationship of the fracture with ligament tears. We also evaluated the correlation of 3 tibial plateau fracture classification systems (Schatzker, AO, and Duparc).

Methods

Over a 2-year period, a single orthopaedic surgeon at our institution managed 90 MLKIs. Images of those knees with a tibial plateau fracture were retrospectively reviewed and classified per Schatzker, AO, and Duparc systems. Correlation among the 3 systems was evaluated using Spearman nonparametric correlation coefficient. Associations between fracture grading system and ligament tears were estimated using logistic regression. Associations between ligament tears and tibial plateau fracture location (medial vs lateral) were estimated using exact logistic regression.

Results

A total of 19 of 90 knees suffered tibial plateau fractures. There was reasonable correlation among the 3 tibial plateau classification systems. Increasing grade under the Schatzker system showed statistically significant associations with medial collateral ligament (MCL) (P = 0.056) and posterolateral corner (PLC) (P = 0.035) tears. Increasing grade under the Duparc system showed statistically significant associations with MCL (P = 0.032) and PLC (P = 0.058) tears. PLC tears had a statistically significant association with medial plateau fractures (P = 0.003); odds ratio of 121.1 (95% CI: 2.2-∞). MCL tears had a statistically significant association with lateral plateau fractures (P = 0.004); odds ratio of 18.4 (95% CI: 2.1-∞). Although not statistically significant, 8 out of 9 knees with a lateral plateau fracture demonstrated tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Conclusions

As the grade of designation increases within the Schatzker and Duparc tibial plateau fracture classifications, as does the likelihood of MCL and PLC tear. The majority of tibial plateau fractures that occur in the context of MLKI are either isolated to the medial or lateral tibial plateau. Medial tibial plateau fractures are associated with PLC tears. Lateral tibial plateau fractures are associated with MCL tears, and although not statistically significant in our small sample size, 8 out of 9 knees also demonstrated a tear of the ACL.

### Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review [^112pQAab]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review of the literature on outcomes following AARIF for the management of tibial plateau fracture included a mixture of retrospective and prospective studies, and a total of 353 patients, most of whom had Schatzker type I to III fractures. These findings suggest that, in general, clinical and radiological outcomes are satisfactory following AARIF for tibial plateau fracture management.

Of note, more than 80% of patients in all studies included in this review had clinical Rasmussen scores that were excellent or good, including one study in which all patients had type V or VI fractures. Radiological outcome findings were less impressive, with patients in only four of the seven studies reporting results having excellent or good Rasmussen scores. The poorer radiological outcomes in the study described by Roerdink et al. may be due to the fact that the patients were far older (mean age = 72 years) than patients in any of the other studies, while the lower scores in the study reported by Siegler et al. may be a reflection of the high rate (48%) of osteoarthritis among the participants. The reasons for the poorer radiological outcomes in the study reported by Pogliacomi et al. are less obvious, but may be a reflection of surgical technique differences, namely combined arthroscopic and radioscopic-assisted fracture reduction. Taken together, we believe there is a strong evidence that AARIF results in satisfactory (good or excellent) clinical outcomes in a large proportion of patients. Radiological outcomes also appear to be satisfactory in the majority of patients; however, the evidence is not as strong as that for clinical outcomes.

### Costs and complications of single-stage fixation versus 2-stage treatment of select bicondylar tibial plateau fractures [^116Rkfq4]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the differences in costs and complications in patients with bicondylar tibial plateau (BTP) fractures treated with 1-stage definitive fixation compared with 2-stage fixation after initial spanning external fixation.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Level 1 Trauma Center.

Patients/Participants

Patients with OTA/AO 41-C (Schatzker 6) BTP fractures treated with open reduction internal fixation.

Intervention

Definitive treatment with open reduction internal fixation either acutely (1 stage) or delayed after initial spanning external fixation (2 stage).

Main Outcome Measures

Wound healing complications, implant costs, hospital charges, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), reoperation, nonunion and infection.

Results

One hundred five patients were identified over a three-year period, of whom 52 met the inclusion criteria. There were 28 patients in the 1-stage group and 24 patients in the 2-stage group. Mean follow-up was 21.8 months, and 87% of patients had at least 12 months of follow-up. The mean number of days to definitive fixation was 1.2 in the 1-stage group and 7.8 in the 2-stage group. There were no differences between groups with respect to wound healing or any other surgery-related complications. Functional outcomes PROMIS were similar between groups. Mean implant cost in the 2-stage group was $10,821 greater than the 1-stage group, mostly because of the costs of external fixation. Median hospital inpatient charges in the 2-stage group exceeded the 1-stage group by more than $68,000 for all BTP fractures and by $61,000 for isolated BTP fractures.

Conclusions

Early single-stage treatment of BTP fractures is cost-effective and is not associated with a higher complication rate than 2-stage treatment in appropriately selected patients.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### The incidence of soft tissue injury in operative tibial plateau fractures: a magnetic resonance imaging analysis of 103 patients [^115Mxn32]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of injury to soft tissue structures of the knee in tibial plateau fractures scheduled for surgery.

Design

Prospective cohort.

Setting

Level I academic medical center.

Patients/Participants

One hundred three consecutive patients with acute tibial plateau fractures indicated for operative intervention.

Intervention

Standard x-ray examinations, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views, were performed in the emergency department. Subsequently all patients had magnetic resonance imaging performed. The Schatzker and AO/OTA classifications were used to classify each fracture pattern based solely on the x-rays. Soft tissue injuries were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.

Main Outcome Measurements

Fifteen categories of injury were determined as positive or negative on each magnetic resonance imaging, which included tears of the cruciates, collateral ligaments, menisci, and posterolateral corner.

Results

The overall incidence of injury to soft tissues was higher than previously reported. Only 1 patient (1%) in the series had complete absence of any soft tissue injury. Seventy-nine patients (77%) sustained a complete tear or avulsion of 1 or more cruciate or collateral ligaments. Ninety-four patients (91%) had evidence of lateral meniscus pathology. Forty-five patients (44%) had medial meniscus tears. Seventy patients (68%) had tears of 1 or more of the posterolateral corner structures of the knee. The most frequent fracture pattern was a lateral plateau split-depression (Schatzker II) (60%). No pure depression injuries (Schatzker III, AO/OTA 41-B2) were seen.

Conclusions

The incidence of complete ligamentous or meniscal disruption associated with operative tibial plateau fractures was higher than previously reported. Though the clinical importance of injury to each of these structures is unknown, the treating surgeon should be aware that a variety of soft tissue injuries are common in these fractures. In addition, all fractures had at least 1 cortical split visible on magnetic resonance imaging, implying that pure depression patterns are very rare or may not exist.

### Second-look arthroscopy after arthroscopy-assisted treatment of tibial plateau fractures [^113v5L7F]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

The only way to show the healing potential in hyaline cartilage after the treatment of tibial plateau fractures in humans is the second-look arthroscopy. Our aim is to examine the healing potential of the hyaline cartilage in tibial plateau fractures treated with arthroscopy-assisted surgery. We applied second-look arthroscopy to the 12 patients out of 52 who had tibial plateau fractures treated by arthroscopy-assisted surgery. The mean age was 41. The tibial plateau fractures were classified according to Schatzker classification. The period between the primary surgical treatment and second-look arthroscopy was on an average of 19 months. Step-off was detected in 3 out of 12 patients. Hyaline cartilage of nine patients who did not have step-off was found obviously on the fracture line. None of them had displacement. Three patients out of 12 were above 50 years old and the average follow-up period was 26 months. Grade II-III chondral defect was detected on the fracture line and femoral condyle in patients above 50 years. For patients below 50 years old, the follow-up period was 21 months and grade I-II chondral defect was detected on the fracture line and femoral condyle. Until now in literature, tibial plateau fractures have been evaluated clinically and radiologically, but in our cases we directly saw the lesion. Cartilage healing is limited in human beings. On the fracture line, cartilage defect continues, although anatomic reduction has been achieved. Moreover, if there is step-off, insufficient healing potential appears. Although we did not have enough cases, we can say that in tibial plateau fractures anatomic reduction is mandatory. Contrary to the common idea, step-off is not tolerated by hyaline cartilage.

### Schatzker II tibial plateau fractures: anatomically precontoured locking compression plates seem to improve radiological and clinical outcomes [^116xYJhA]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The design of anatomically precontoured locking compression plates (LCP) allows the placement of angular stable screws right underneath the reduced joint surface fragments. To date, there is a lack of evidence supporting the broad utilization of these implants in split depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau. Thus, aim of the present matched pair retrospective cohort study was to investigate the radiological and clinical outcomes of anatomically precontoured LCP compared to conventional plate and screw osteosynthesis in Schatzker II fractures.

Material and Methods

The institutional databank was searched for Schatzker II fractures from 2010 to 2016. Patients that underwent open reduction and internal fixation with anatomically precontoured 3.5 mm LCP or conventional 4.5 mm l-shaped plates and screws were included. CT scans and radiographs were analyzed. Details of the operative procedures and secondary events were collected. A matched pair analyses was conducted in a best fit manner. The primary outcome parameter was the Rasmussen Radiological Score approximately one year postoperatively. Secondary outcome parameters were the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), the Rasmussen Clinical Score and the WOMAC Score after a follow up of at least three years.

Results

A total of 50 patients was included. Patient age, gender distribution, size and depression depth of the lateral joint surface fragments, frequency of utilizing bone grafts or substitutes and lateral meniscus repair as well as subsequent implant removal were comparable across the groups. Immediately postoperatively, the Rasmussen Radiological Score revealed no differences. After a mean of 64.2 weeks, the radiological outcome was significantly better in the LCP 3.5 group (RRS 8.2 vs. 6.3 points, p < 0.001; MPTA 89.5 vs. 92.0°, p = 0.001). After a mean clinical follow-up of 4.5 years, the Rasmussen Clinical Score (22.9 vs. 27.8 points, p < 0.001) and the WOMAC score (24.3 vs. 16.0 points, p = 0.04) revealed significantly impaired results in the conventional group.

Conclusion

Anatomically precontoured LCP prevent the subsidence of the reduced joint surface fragments more sufficiently and allow for improved patient outcomes compared to conventional plates and screws. The utilization of anatomically precontoured LCP should therefore closely be considered for internal fixation of any split depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau.

### Are 3D-printed models of tibial plateau fractures a useful addition to understanding fractures for junior surgeons? [^1132eHyw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Classifications are often unreliable and can therefore result in treatment choices that may harm patients. By using new techniques, such as 3D-printed models, orthopaedic surgeons try to improve the classification process. However, studies on humerus, distal radius, and acetabular fractures show no improvement in interobserver agreement. The additional value of 3D-printed models in the classification of tibial plateau fractures remained dubious and was therefore evaluated in this study. In line with previous studies, we found only small improvements of the interobserver agreement, and no classification system achieved more than moderate interobserver agreement. This suggests that even with the addition of 3D-printed models, many fractures would be misclassified, leading to misleading communication, inaccurate prognostic assessments, and incorrect treatment choices.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we found minimal improvement in interobserver agreement; however, no interobserver agreement better than moderate was achieved. This improvement could be explained by learning bias, especially for junior surgical residents, as they are the least experienced observers. We tried to diminish this learning bias by providing a minimum time period of 1 month between the first and second assessment and providing a crossover between the two observer groups. A surprising result is the deterioration in the interobserver agreement for trauma surgeons in the AO/OTA classification. This suggests that, even with an additional 3D-printed model, trauma surgeons would misclassify more fractures than without this additional information. This highlights the poor additional value of classification systems in the preoperative planning of tibial plateau fractures. In contrast with the low interobserver agreement, we found a high self-assessed confidence in all subgroups. Given that we only asked the overall confidence instead of the confidence per classification system, we cannot analyze this further by classification system.

### Articular coronal fracture angle of posteromedial tibial plateau fragments: a computed tomography fracture mapping study [^114eYdaY]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to analyze posteromedial fragment morphology using two-dimensional computed tomography fracture mapping and to compare posteromedial fragment morphology in various Schatzker type tibial plateau fractures.

Materials & Methods

One hundred twenty-seven consecutive AO/OTA B- and C-type tibial plateau fractures were retrospectively analyzed using 2DCT fracture mapping. The posteromedial articular fracture angle and articular surface areas of all fractures with posteromedial fragments were calculated. Based on biomechanical studies, posteromedial fragments with coronal fracture angles > 68° were considered amenable for anterolateral stabilization with standardized plating. Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test was used for statistical comparison of morphological features of posteromedial fragments between the various Schatzker types.

Results

Forty-seven out of 127 tibial plateau fractures included a posteromedial fragment. The mean posteromedial articular fracture angle was 44° (range: 2°-90°, standard deviation: 23°). Forty fragments (85%) had a fracture angle of < 68°, increasing the risk for insufficient stabilization with standardized anterolateral plating. The mean articular surface area was 34% of the entire tibial plateau (range: 7%-53%, SD: 12%). There were no significant differences in posteromedial fragment morphology between Schatzker type IV, V, and VI fractures.

Discussion and Conclusion

Posteromedial fragments commonly occur not only in Schatzker type V and VI, but also in Schatzker type IV tibial plateau fractures. Eighty-five percent of tibial plateau fractures with a posteromedial fragment may benefit from non-standard customized lateral plating, or may require an additional medial or posterior surgical approach for fracture-specific fixation to optimize screw purchase and biomechanical stability.

### Skiers and snowboarders have improved short-term outcomes with immediate fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^111j6eRN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The primary limitation of our study is its retrospective nature and the inability to obtain follow-up data after the patients were discharged from the hospital, which prohibited the study of long-term outcomes. Other authors have studied long-term outcomes; Rademakers et al noted excellent long-term (mean 14 years) outcomes with the ability to regain activity as prior to their injury for patients with TPF treated with ORIF. Loibl et al assessed the ability of skiers treated surgically for TPF to resume physical activities and found that the majority could regain an active lifestyle after their injury (88%), though only 53% resumed skiing (mean follow-up time of 7.8 ± 1.8 years). Tang et al compared patients with Schatzker IV–VI TPFs who were surgically treated within 12 hours after surgery with patients who were first treated by traction or plaster fixation for 1–2 weeks. They found that, at 3 months postoperation, the delayed group had significantly better knee function as scored by the Hospital for Special Surgery scoring method but that this difference was not evident at the end of follow-up (mean 16.5 months). Unfortunately, we do not have access to these data for our study population and are therefore unable to study the effect of high-energy versus low-energy trauma or immediate vs delayed ORIF on any outcomes occurring after discharge. Additionally, our results reflect the injuries and practices of a rural, mountain hospital frequented with isolated TPFs in snow sport participants. These results are applicable for alpine snow sport participants but may not be generalizable to the broader isolated TPF population. Finally, this study included multiple treating physicians, making it difficult to ascertain whether a patient was treated immediately or delayed due to physician preference or injury severity. High-energy fractures can be operated on initially if the skin and swelling have no serious abrasions, cuts or blisters and are therefore considered adequate for closure. There are some cases though where the patient is not able to have immediate fixation and must be delayed. Unfortunately, the swelling/skin assessment was subjective to the treating physician, with no classification system consistently utilized by surgeons. Hence, we were unable to provide information on physician preference or the soft tissue swelling/skin assessment. Among snow sport participants with a TPF, a prospective study is warranted where the soft tissues are judged up front, using a consistent rubric, and long-term functional outcomes are examined.

### Skiers and snowboarders have improved short-term outcomes with immediate fixation of tibial plateau fractures [^115oMTKf]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Flow chart showing the inclusion criteria for patients with tibial plateau fracture treated with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF).

The following in-hospital outcomes were compared between snow sport patients who underwent immediate versus delayed ORIF: incidence of compartment syndrome defined as a condition not present at admission in which there is documentation of tense muscular compartments through clinical assessment or direct measurement requiring fasciotomy, number of OR visits and procedures, number of fasciotomy procedures, infection, mortality, discharge disposition (home vs skilled nursing facilities), hospital LOS and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patient demographic and clinical characteristics examined included: age, sex, race/ethnicity (white vs other), smoking status, presence of any comorbidities, Injury Severity Score (ISS; 4 vs ≥ 4), fracture type (open vs closed), time from injury to ORIF, high (Schatzker IV–VI) or low (Schatzker I–III) energy fracture and the AO/OTA fracture classification pattern.

The data were analyzed using SAS software (V.9.3). The Pearson or Fisher's exact χ² test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon two-sample test for continuous variables were used to examine differences between immediate and delayed ORIF in snow sport participants. These analyses were also performed in the subsets of patients with high-energy and low-energy fractures. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

### Surgical technique: tscherne-Johnson extensile approach for tibial plateau fractures [^113Xiuw6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Of the second group of 10 patients with extensive fractures of the posterior plateau, all had an anterolateral plateau intraarticular osteotomy and bilateral joint distraction (Fig. 4). There were seven males and three females with an average age of 50 years (range, 34–62 years). All fractures had oblique posteromedial plateau shear fractures combined with posterocentral and posterolateral depression fractures with intact anterolateral plateau cortex. These fractures did not fit the Schatzker classification. These were variants between Types IV and V fractures. There were seven right and three left plateau fractures. Measurements were performed on PACS digital systems using digital rulers on both AP, lateral, and CT radiographs. Preoperative intraarticular fragment depression averaged 18 mm (range, 11–28 mm), and tibial width averaged 95 mm (range, 85–103 mm). These 10 patients had almost 2.5 times the amount of articular depression compared with the first group of 66 patients. Three of 10 patients had additional posteromedial plateau plating for medial cortical comminution. In seven of 10 patients, posteromedial fractures were stabilized with AP lag screws. Bone bank allograft croutons were used as grafting material in all 10 patients.

Patients were seen at intervals of 10 days and 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks postoperatively. All patients had AP (10° internal rotation view) and lateral radiographs at 30° of knee flexion. Examinations included knee ROM (examined and documented by the senior surgeon), assessment of wound healing, and radiographic assessment of healing by the senior author at each visit. Healing was assessed by progressive remodeling of bone, incorporation of fracture lines, observance of any evidence of loosening of fixation, and maintenance of articular surface reduction. Two authors (EEJ, TS) evaluated all radiographic images within the group of 66 patients, and two authors (EEJ, CO) evaluated all radiographic images of the 10 patients with posterior plateau fractures. Final radiographs were evaluated for amount of depression on both AP and lateral radiographs, incorporation of fracture lines and bone graft, and evidence of any radiolucency or hardware loosening.

### The use of freeze-dried cancelous allograft in the management of impacted tibial plateau fractures [^1156wMAi]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to assess the behaviour of freeze-dried cancellous allograft used for supporting the reconstructed articular surface in impacted tibial plateau fractures. Freeze-dried cancellous allograft was used as metaphyseal defect filling agent in twenty-three patients (fifteen men and eight women, mean age 53 years), who suffered impacted tibial plateau fractures. According to Schatzker classification, ten fractures were classified as type II, six as type III, three as type V and four as type VI. All fractures were treated with open reduction-internal fixation after restoration of the tibial plateau surface and insertion of freeze-dried allograft chips for subchondral support. The mean follow-up was 13 months. The clinical and radiological outcome was assessed according to the modified Rasmussen system. The freeze-dried allograft incorporated soundly in all cases within 12 weeks from surgery and no complications that could relate to the graft were recorded. Freeze-dried allograft has specific advantages in comparison to autograft or other grafts and the results of the present study justify its use in the treatment of impacted tibial plateau fractures.

### Tibial plateau fracture management: arthroscopically-assisted versus ORIF procedure-clinical and radiological comparison [^113pk4Ei]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tibial plateau fractures are articular injuries that may influence final functional outcome of the knee. Although these fractures comprise only 1% of all fractures, the fracture pattern is usually complex and requires anatomical reduction and absolutely stable fixation to achieve satisfactory results. The development of knee osteoarthritis is a common late complication and it can be strongly influenced by additional, underestimated cartilage defects, and meniscal and ligament tears.

Materials and Methods

Between January 2012 and February 2015, a total of 78 patients with tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker type I-III) were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: one group was treated with arthroscopically-assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) and the other with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The final number of patients was 75; 40 in the ARIF group and 35 in the ORIF group. Radiography and computed tomography were used to assess fracture pattern. An immediate postoperative radiograph was performed, and then repeated at 6 weeks, and 3,6 and 12 months after surgery. Demographic data (age and sex), additional intraarticular injuries, hospital stay and complications were noted, and clinical and radiological Rasmunssen score at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were evaluated.

Results

Additional intraarticular lesions were found in 27 patients; 20 in the ARIF group and 7 in the ORIF group (p = 0.06). There was a statistically significant difference in average duration of hospital stay: 3.10 ± 0.63 days for the ARIF group and 5.51 ± 1.66 days for the ORIF group (p = 0.0001). All fractures healed within 3 months following surgery. The overall complication rate was 12%. There was no statistically significant difference in complication rate between the two groups (p = 0.63). Clinical and radiological scores were excellent in most patients in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in average clinical and radiological Rasmunssen scores between the two groups.

Conclusions

Both ARIF and ORIF can provide equally good results; however, ARIF seems to offer a more precise evaluation and treatment of associated intraarticular lesions and to reduce the duration of hospital stay.

### Development of machine learning-based algorithms to predict the 2-and 5-year risk of TKA after tibial plateau fracture treatment [^114C9zYa]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

When faced with a severe intraarticular injury like a tibial plateau fracture, patients count on surgeons to make an accurate estimation of prognosis. Unfortunately, there are few tools available that enable precise, personalized prognosis estimation tailored to each patient's unique circumstances, including their individual and fracture-specific characteristics. In this study, we developed and validated a clinical prediction model using machine-learning algorithms for the 2- and 5-year risk of TKA after tibia plateau fractures.

Questions/Purposes

Can machine learning-based probability calculators estimate the probability of 2- and 5-year risk of conversion to TKA in patients with a tibial plateau fracture?

Methods

A multicenter, cross-sectional study was performed in six hospitals in patients treated for a tibial plateau fracture between 2003 to 2019. In total, 2057 patients were eligible for inclusion and were sent informed consent and a questionnaire to inquire whether they underwent conversion to TKA. For 56% (1160 of 2057), status of conversion to TKA was accounted for at a minimum of 2 years, and 53% (1082 of 2057) were accounted for at a minimum of 5 years. The mean follow-up among responders was 6 ± 4 years after injury. An analysis of nonresponders found that responders were slightly older than nonresponders (53 ± 16 years versus 51 ± 17 years; p = 0.001), they were more often women (68% [788 of 1160] versus 58% [523 of 897]; p = 0.001), they were treated nonoperatively less often (30% [346 of 1160] versus 43% [387 of 897]; p = 0.001), and they had larger fracture gaps (6.4 ± 6.3 mm versus 4.2 ± 5.2 mm; p < 0.001) and step-offs (6.3 ± 5.7 mm versus 4.5 ± 4.7 mm; p < 0.001). AO Foundation/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) fracture classification did not differ between nonresponders and responders (B1 11% versus 15%, B2 16% versus 19%, B3 45% versus 39%, C2 6% versus 8%, C3 22% versus 17%; p = 0.26). A total of 70% (814 of 1160) of patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, whereas 30% (346 of 1160) of patients were treated nonoperatively with a cast. Most fractures (80% [930 of 1160]) were AO/OTA type B fractures, and 20% (230 of 1160) were type C. Of these patients, 7% (79 of 1160) and 10% (109 of 1082) underwent conversion to a TKA at 2- and 5-year follow-up, respectively. Patient characteristics were retrieved from electronic patient records, and imaging data were shared with the initiating center from which fracture characteristics were determined. Obtained features derived from follow-up questionnaires, electronic patient records, and radiographic assessments were eligible for development of the prediction model. The first step consisted of data cleaning and included simple type formatting and standardization of numerical columns. Subsequent feature selection consisted of a review of the published evidence and expert opinion. This was followed by bivariate analysis of the identified features. The features for the models included: age, gender, BMI, AO/OTA fracture classification, fracture displacement (gap, step-off), medial proximal tibial alignment, and posterior proximal tibial alignment. The data set was used to train three models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Logistic regression models linear relationships, random forest handles nonlinear complexities with decision trees, and XGBoost excels with sequential error correction and regularization. The models were tested using a sixfold validation approach by training the model on data from five (of six) respective medical centers and validating it against the remaining center that was left out for training. Performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which measures a model's ability to distinguish between classes. AUC varies between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating better performance. To ensure robust and reliable results, we used bootstrapping as a resampling technique. In addition, calibration curves were plotted, and calibration was assessed with the calibration slope and intercept. The calibration plot compares the estimated probabilities with the observed probabilities for the primary outcome. Calibration slope evaluates alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes (1 = perfect, < 1 = overfit, > 1 = underfit). Calibration intercept indicates bias (0 = perfect, negative = underestimation, positive = overestimation). Last, the Brier score, measuring the mean squared error of predicted probabilities (0 = perfect), was calculated.

Results

There were no differences among the models in terms of sensitivity and specificity; the AUCs for each overlapped broadly and ranged from 0.76 to 0.83. Calibration was most optimal in logistic regression for both 2- and 5-year models, with slopes of 0.82 (random forest 0.60, XGBoost 0.26) and 0.95 (random forest 0.85, XGBoost 0.48) and intercepts of 0.01 for both (random forest 0.01 to 0.02; XGBoost 0.05 to 0.07). Brier score was similar between models varying between 0.06 to 0.09. Given that its performance metrics were highest, we chose the logistic regression algorithm as the final prediction model. The web application providing the prediction tool is freely available and can be accessed through: https://3dtrauma.shinyapps.io/tka_prediction/.

Conclusion

In this study, a personalized risk assessment tool was developed to support clinical decision-making and patient counseling. Our findings demonstrate that machine-learning algorithms, particularly logistic regression, can provide accurate and reliable predictions of TKA conversion at 2 and 5 years after a tibial plateau fracture. In addition, it provides a useful prognostic tool for surgeons who perform fracture surgery that can be used quickly and easily with patients in the clinic or emergency department once it complies with medical device regulations. External validation is needed to assess performance in other institutions and countries; to account for patient and surgeon preferences, resources, and cultures; and to further strengthen its clinical applicability.

### Intra-articular tibial plateau fracture characteristics according to the "Ten segment classification" [^11541RmS]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Currently existing classifications of tibial plateau fractures do not help to guide surgical strategy. Recently, a segment-based mapping of the tibial plateau has been introduced in order to address fractures with a fracture-specific surgical approach. The goal of the present study was to analyze incidence and fracture specifics according to a new 10-segment classification of the tibial plateau.

Methods

A total of 242 patients with 246 affected knees were included (124 females, 118 males, mean age 51.9 ± 16.1years). Fractures were classified according to the OTA/AO classification. Fracture pattern was analyzed with respect to a 10-segment classification based on CT imaging of the proximal tibial plateau 3cm below the articular surface.

Results

161 Patients suffered an OTA/AO type 41-B and 85 patients an OTA/AO type 41-C tibial plateau fracture. Females had an almost seven times higher risk to suffer a fracture due to low-energy trauma (OR 6.91, 95% CI (3.52, 13.54), p < 0.001) than males. In 34% of the patients with affection of the medial tibial plateau, a fracture comminution, primarily due to low-energy trauma (p < 0.001), was observed. In type B fractures, the postero-latero-lateral (65.2%), the antero-latero-lateral (64.6%) and the antero-latero-central (60.9%) segment were most frequently affected. Every second type C fracture showed an unique fracture line and zone of comminution. The tibial spine was typically involved (89.4%). A typical fracture pattern of high-energy trauma demonstrated a zone of comminution of the lateral plateau and a split fracture in the medial plateau. The most frequently affected segments were the postero-latero-central (85.9%), postero-central (84.7%), and antero-latero-central (78.8%) segment.

Conclusion

Posterior segments were the most frequently affected in OTA/AO type B and C fractures. Acknowledging the restricted visibility of posterior segments, whose reduction and fixation is crucial for long-term success, our findings implicate the use of posterior approaches more often in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Also, low-energy trauma was identified as an important cause for tibial plateau fractures.

### What is the patient-reported outcome and complication incidence after operative versus nonoperative treatment of minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures? [^115NaKHo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Whether minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures should be treated operatively or nonoperatively remains controversial. There is no consensus regarding whether the generally used indication for operative treatment based on fracture displacement greater than 2 mm is crucial for attaining a good clinical outcome. We evaluated a large cohort of patients with tibial plateau fractures with minimal displacement to assess whether this recommendation based on radiographs could be justified or whether this should be revisited based on evolving insights from CT images. We found that regardless of the treatment type, no clinically important differences in patient-reported outcomes were seen at midterm follow-up. Among the patients who underwent operative treatment, 4% had a complication, and 39% of the operatively treated patients underwent one or more additional surgical procedures, often in the form of elective implant removal (36% [70 of 195]). Based on these findings, we believe that nonoperative treatment should be considered the preferred treatment option in patients with minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures with gaps and stepoffs up to 4 mm.
