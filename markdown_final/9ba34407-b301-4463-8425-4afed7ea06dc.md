## Question

Blood clots on the white of eyes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "blood clots on the white of the eyes" mean, how to distinguish the likely causes, what actions to take, and when it might be a cause for concern. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most common diagnosis that patients describe this way. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic this appearance or coexist. Next, I will review red flags that mandate urgent care. After that, I need to check risk factors and when a systemic workup is warranted. Finally, I will outline management, prognosis, and prevention, and I will anchor this to current guidelines and evidence so I don't over- or under-treat.

> Let me first confirm the most likely diagnosis. When patients say "blood clot on the white of the eye", they are usually describing a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which is bleeding under the clear conjunctiva over the sclera and appears as a bright red, sharply demarcated patch on the bulbar conjunctiva; it is painless, non-vision-threatening, and typically resolves spontaneously over 1–3 weeks without treatment [^115PkPXd] [^116BGD7B] [^116rXWv2].

> Wait, let me verify the key mimics and differentials so I don't miss something important. Hyphema is blood in the anterior chamber and looks like a layered reddish fluid level behind the cornea, often after trauma; it is not on the surface and can threaten vision, so it needs ophthalmic management and activity restriction, not home care [^115RZaJm] [^11129vam]. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is bleeding in the potential space between choroid and sclera, typically post-surgical or traumatic, and presents with pain, shallow anterior chamber, and sometimes elevated IOP; it is a different compartment entirely and far more serious than a subconjunctival hemorrhage [^116LNkZ9]. Retinal vein occlusion causes retinal hemorrhages and vision loss, not a visible surface "clot", and requires urgent ophthalmic evaluation and systemic risk assessment [^1174mRxv] [^114XFRNY]. I should also remember that a dense subconjunctival hemorrhage can hide a scleral laceration or ruptured globe, so I need to check for other trauma signs before concluding it is benign [^115PkPXd] [^116BGD7B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what exactly should I look for on exam to confirm this is a simple subconjunctival hemorrhage and not something worse? I need to check for pain, photophobia, vision change, foreign-body sensation, discharge, and whether the redness is diffuse versus sharply circumscribed; a painless, bright red, flat patch without corneal or anterior chamber involvement supports subconjunctival hemorrhage, whereas pain, photophobia, corneal opacity, or a layered hyphema indicate deeper pathology and warrant urgent ophthalmic care [^115y7vo5] [^112LfBMB] [^115LqyVF].

> I should confirm the common causes and risk factors so counseling is accurate. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is often spontaneous or associated with Valsalva (coughing, sneezing, vomiting, straining), minor trauma or eye rubbing, contact lens wear, hypertension, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy; recurrence or atypical features should prompt evaluation for bleeding diathesis or systemic vascular disease [^115PkPXd] [^116eWq1F] [^116rXWv2].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an anticoagulant — does that change management? I need to ensure I don't overreact. Therapeutic anticoagulation at standard levels is not a contraindication to routine ocular procedures, and isolated subconjunctival hemorrhage does not require stopping anticoagulation; however, if there are recurrent or unusually large bleeds, I should coordinate with the prescribing clinician to review INR or antiplatelet adequacy and consider a bleeding workup if indicated [^114sTBYR] [^116eWq1F].

> Next, I should review red flags that mandate urgent ophthalmology referral so I don't miss sight-threatening disease. I need to check for pain, vision loss, photophobia, corneal involvement, hyphema, double vision, proptosis, severe headache with ocular signs, or a history of recent eye surgery or penetrating trauma. Any of these should trigger same-day ophthalmic evaluation rather than reassurance alone [^115y7vo5] [^112LfBMB] [^1149bgFP].

> Let me think about management if this is a straightforward subconjunctival hemorrhage. No treatment is required. I should advise artificial tears for comfort, avoid rubbing, and reassure that the redness will typically fade over 1–3 weeks as the blood clears. If the patient is on anticoagulants, I should confirm therapeutic ranges with the treating clinician and only adjust if there are additional bleeding concerns or recurrent events [^115PkPXd] [^116BGD7B] [^114sTBYR].

> I should double-check when a systemic workup is warranted. Recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages, unusually large or persistent bleeds, bilateral simultaneous hemorrhages, or associated bruising or mucosal bleeding should prompt evaluation for hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathies, platelet disorders, or medication effects; in children, I need to consider nonaccidental trauma if the history is inconsistent or other injuries are present [^116eWq1F] [^116LeZNS] [^113Ys59L].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about prevention and patient education so this doesn't keep happening? I need to ensure blood pressure is controlled, diabetes is optimized, and Valsalva-heavy activities are moderated when feasible; if anticoagulation is excessive, I should coordinate dose review, but routine anticoagulation at therapeutic levels should not be stopped for a benign subconjunctival hemorrhage [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to avoid missing anything critical. In most cases, "blood clots on the white of the eyes" reflect a benign subconjunctival hemorrhage that needs no treatment beyond reassurance and time. However, I must actively exclude hyphema, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and retinal vascular occlusions by checking for pain, vision changes, corneal or anterior chamber involvement, and trauma history, and I should escalate urgently if any red flags are present [^115PkPXd] [^115RZaJm] [^116LNkZ9] [^1174mRxv].

Blood clots on the white of the eye are most often **subconjunctival hemorrhages** — bright red, painless patches caused by rupture of small conjunctival vessels [^115PkPXd]. They are **usually benign and self-limited**, resolving in 1–2 weeks without treatment [^116BGD7B]. Common triggers include trauma, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, heavy lifting, or anticoagulant use [^116eWq1F]; recurrent or unexplained cases warrant evaluation for hypertension, diabetes, or bleeding disorders [^116eWq1F]. Management is supportive: artificial tears, avoidance of rubbing, and monitoring for vision changes or pain. Urgent care is needed for **pain, vision loss, or recurrent hemorrhages** to rule out serious causes like hyphema, scleritis, or orbital hemorrhage [^112LfBMB].

---

## Clinical appearance and symptoms

- **Appearance**: Bright red, flat, well-demarcated patches on the sclera (white of the eye) [^115PkPXd].
- **Symptoms**: Typically painless, no vision loss, no discharge; may cause mild irritation or foreign-body sensation [^116rXWv2].
- **Progression**: Color fades from red to yellow/green as hemoglobin breaks down, usually resolving within 1–2 weeks [^notfound].

---

## Common causes and risk factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Trauma | - Direct injury <br/> - Rubbing <br/> - Contact lens irritation <br/> - Surgical procedures (e.g. cataract, LASIK) [^111D7a64] [^111MH8WU] |
| Valsalva maneuvers | - Coughing <br/> - Sneezing <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Heavy lifting <br/> - Straining during bowel movements [^115PkPXd] |
| Systemic conditions | - Hypertension <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Atherosclerosis <br/> - Bleeding disorders (e.g. thrombocytopenia, hemophilia) <br/> - Anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel) [^116eWq1F] [^116rXWv2] |
| Idiopathic | Spontaneous rupture of fragile conjunctival vessels, especially in older adults [^116rXWv2] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Hyphema**: Blood in the anterior chamber; painful, vision-threatening, requires urgent care [^115RZaJm].
- **Scleritis/episcleritis**: Inflammatory redness with pain or tenderness [^113xjc2j].
- **Orbital hemorrhage**: Proptosis, diplopia, restricted eye movement, severe pain [^notfound].
- **Conjunctivitis**: Diffuse redness with discharge or irritation [^115LqyVF].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

History should cover trauma, recent Valsalva, medication use, and systemic symptoms; the **exam** is a focused ocular assessment for redness pattern, pain, vision changes, discharge, or other abnormalities [^112LfBMB]. Testing is generally not needed for isolated cases; consider blood pressure, CBC, PT/INR, or aPTT for recurrent or unexplained hemorrhages [^notfound].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Supportive care**: Artificial tears for comfort, avoid rubbing, cold compresses if needed [^1149bgFP].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for vision changes, pain, or recurrent hemorrhages.
- **Address underlying factors**: Control hypertension, diabetes, or bleeding disorders; adjust anticoagulants if medically appropriate [^116eWq1F].
- **No invasive treatment**: Avoid unnecessary interventions; most resolve spontaneously [^116BGD7B].

---

## Potential complications

Complications are rare; **rebleeding** can occur, especially with trauma or anticoagulant use. Persistent redness beyond 2–3 weeks warrants reassessment. Underlying systemic disease may be unmasked, prompting further evaluation [^116eWq1F].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; most resolve completely within 1–2 weeks without sequelae [^notfound]. Recurrence is common, especially with persistent risk factors or anticoagulant use [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek care for **pain, vision changes, or recurrent hemorrhages** to rule out serious pathology [^1149bgFP]. Suspected trauma or injury warrants evaluation, and associated systemic symptoms (e.g. easy bruising, nosebleeds) should prompt further workup [^116eWq1F].

---

Blood clots on the white of the eye are **usually harmless subconjunctival hemorrhages** that resolve spontaneously; identify and manage triggers, and seek care for atypical features or recurrence.

1 Introduction

In December 2019 China experienced an outbreak of a new Coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease that quickly reached the size of a pandemic in early 2020was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections display mild to moderate symptoms. Nevertheless, approximately one out of five patients require hospital admission of whom approximately 16% require intensive care assistance.

The reason why the clinical course may range from mild to severe is still poorly understood, but it could be speculated that the host immune system could play a role in defining the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, some authors have suggested the cytokine storm as the underling mechanism leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development. Moreover, different studies have reported a direct correlation between levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the disease severity.

Coagulation disorders are also common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those with severe disease. Blood hypercoagulability, elevated D-Dimer levels, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase are consistently reported. In addition, several studies found diffuse endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events affecting different body districts other than the lungs have been reported.

The examination of the ocular fundus allows a thorough evaluation of the retina and its vasculature. The arteries and veins of the retina represent a window on the vascular system as they are exposed to the same pathological processes and show changes in many systemic diseases. The acquisition of retinal color photographs is fast, non-invasive and is commonly used to screen large populations of patients with systemic diseases including hypertension and diabetes both to identify new cases and follow those with an established diagnosis.

Alterations of the retina are also commonly seen in patients with viral diseases. These pathologic phenomena can occur due to a direct cytopathic effect of the microorganism on retinal neurons as in case of cytomegalovirus, or secondary to a damage to the microvasculature when the virus targets the vessels endothelium like in HIV retinopathy. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect endothelial cellsand has been detected in the retina. The aim of this study was to screen the fundus of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to detect possible alterations of the retina or the retinal vasculature related to COVID-19 and to assess the possible correlations with the clinical parameters.

Background

Suprachoroidal haemorrhage is a rare complication of intraocular surgery or trauma. Even more rarely it may be spontaneous. Risk factors include older age, patients on systemic anticoagulation, systemic hypertension, atherosclerosis, age-related macular degeneration and chronic kidney disease. When they occur, Suprachoroidal haemorrhages often have devastating visual outcome despite conservative and/or surgical intervention.

### Aflibercept (Eylea HD) [^113cTp2H]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.3)]
Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

A total of 1164 patients were treated with EYLEA HD and 503 patients were treated with EYLEA 2 mg in two clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥ 3% of patients treated with EYLEA HD were cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, intraocular pressure increased, ocular discomfort/eye pain/eye irritation, vision blurred, vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, corneal epithelium defect, and retinal hemorrhage. The data described below reflect exposure to EYLEA HD or EYLEA 2 mg in controlled clinical studies (PULSAR and PHOTON), each for 48 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in < 1% of participants treated with EYLEA HD were ocular hyperemia (includes adverse events of conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival irritation, ocular hyperemia), lacrimation increased, eyelid edema, hypersensitivity (includes adverse events of rash, urticaria, pruritus), retinal tear and injection site hemorrhage.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of aflibercept. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Eye disorders:

Retinal vasculitis and occlusive retinal vasculitis related to intravitreal injection with aflibercept (reported at a rate of 0.6 and 0.2 per 1 million injections, respectively, based on postmarketing experience from November 2011 until November 2023).
Scleritis.

### Medical interventions for traumatic hyphema [^1136HUb6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and iris) subsequent to a blow or a projectile striking the eye. Hyphema uncommonly causes permanent loss of vision. Associated trauma (e.g., corneal staining, traumatic cataract, angle recession glaucoma, optic atrophy, etc.) may seriously affect vision. Such complications may lead to permanent impairment of vision. Patients with sickle cell trait/disease may be particularly susceptible to increases of elevated intraocular pressure. If rebleeding occurs, the rates and severity of complications increase.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of various medical interventions in the management of traumatic hyphema.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). We searched the reference lists of identified trial reports to find additional trials. We also searched the ISI Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) to find studies that cited the identified trials. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 25 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by the electronic and manual searches. In this review, we included randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared various medical interventions to other medical interventions or control groups for the treatment of traumatic hyphema following closed globe trauma. There were no restrictions regarding age, gender, severity of the closed globe trauma or level of visual acuity at the time of enrollment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data for the primary and secondary outcomes. We entered and analyzed data using Review Manager (RevMan) 5. We performed meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model and reported dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios and continuous outcomes as mean differences.

Main Results

Nineteen randomized and seven quasi-randomized studies with 2,560 participants were included in this review. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (oral and systemic aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. No intervention had a significant effect on visual acuity whether measured at two weeks or less after the trauma or at longer time periods. The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of aminocaproic acid compared to no use, but was not altered by any other intervention. Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.5), but a sensitivity analysis omitting studies not using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.09). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10). We found tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49), as did aminomethylbenzoic acid as reported in a single study (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32). The evidence to support an associated reduction in the risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e., corneal blood staining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compares with placebo. We found no difference in the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose. The available evidence on usage of corticosteroids, cycloplegics or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials. We found no difference in effect between a single versus binocular patch nor ambulation versus complete bed rest on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed.

Authors' Conclusions

Traumatic hyphema in the absence of other intraocular injuries, uncommonly leads to permanent loss of vision. Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage could lead to permanent impairment of vision, especially in patients with sickle cell trait/disease. We found no evidence to show an effect on visual acuity by any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although evidence is limited, it appears that patients with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhaging. However, hyphema in patients on aminocaproic acid take longer to clear. Other than the possible benefits of antifibrinolytic usage to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage, the decision to use corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or non-drug interventions (such as binocular patching, bed rest, or head elevation) should remain individualized because no solid scientific evidence supports a benefit. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value.

### Imaging of aqueous outflow in health and glaucoma. justifying the re-direction of aqueous [^116nJGQD]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
Aqueous outflow after standalone TBS seems to reduce 1 day after surgery (D1), begins to recover after 1 week when a 38% IOP spike developed (W1), and then improves after 4 weeks (W4).

The white arrow in the preoperative image (0) represents the direction of aqueous drainage away from the limbus. AqCA reduces after surgery and then exceeds the preoperative measurement after 4 weeks. AqCA indicates aqueous column cross-sectional area, IOP intraocular pressure, TBS trabecular bypass surgery. Figure reprinted from Lusthaus JA et al. with permission from Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Secondly, in 6 eyes, aqueous laminar flow worsened or was lost at post-operative weeks 1 and 4. Two of these eyes demonstrated complete loss of the aqueous column with reversal of blood flow towards the limbus. In both cases this finding occurred despite an adjacently implanted stent. It is not yet possible to determine whether the stent induced flow reversal or regional pathological changes within Schlemm's canal, or the episcleral venous system, prevented acceptance of aqueous. The latter hypothesis is supported by genome-wide association studies that suggest structures distal to the trabecular meshwork may be responsible for AO resistance in a proportion of patients. Genetic studies indicate Schlemm's canal is a lymphatic-like vessel and dysregulation of lymphangiogenesis may contribute to glaucoma pathogenesis. This suggests a possible explanation for impaired aqueous outflow after trabecular-targeted treatments in some eyes.

Lastly, redirection of aqueous into neighbouring vessels was seen in 4 eyes. It is not known whether diversion of flow occurred due to preferential drainage induced by the stent or localised obstruction within Schlemm's canal due to blood clotting or inflammation. Aqueous outflow patterns after iStent Inject in glaucomatous eyes represent a range of pathophysiological responses to reduced trabecular resistance, however some of the changes may be related to the physical presence of the stent. Pre-operative AO characteristics to predict surgical outcomes are even less apparent. Identifying pathological manifestations of glaucoma within the episcleral venous system relies upon a clear definition of normal AO. However, the dynamic nature of the AO system makes it challenging to define. Manipulations of IOP within a clinic setting induce physiological responses that permit comparison between normal and glaucomatous eyes.

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Risk of Developing Blood Clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives; in particular, a clot in the leg can cause thrombophlebitis, and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast feeding. If you are breast feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on Breast Feeding in GENERAL PRECAUTIONS).

2. Heart Attacks and Strokes

Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or disability.

### A rare case of acute angle closure due to spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage secondary to loss of anti-coagulation control: a case report [^115KPmym]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Suprachoroidal haemorrhage is a rare complication of either medical anticoagulation treatment or intraocular surgical procedures. Suprachoroidal haemorrhages often have devastating visual outcome despite conservative and/or surgical intervention.

Case presentation

A patient with known Open Angle Glaucoma and Atrial Fibrillation on warfarin presents symptoms and signs suggestive acute angle closure. Examination reveals the underlying cause is a large, macula involving, spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage secondary to loss of anti-coagulation control. Following aggressive medical treatment and surgical intervention, including drainage combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant, pars-plana vitrectomy, and external drainage of suprachoroidal haematoma, we managed to preserve the patient's eye and some of its function.

Conclusion

Spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhages are rare complications of loss of anticoagulation control. Our case shows that aggressive treatment in selected cases can offer a relatively good outcome.

### Complications of sickle cell disease… [^113LXhaY]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia With SCD, the red blood cells die early, leading to a condition called anemia. Anemia occurs when there is not enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. When a person has anemia, they might feel tired. Other symptoms can include:

- Irritability
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- A fast heart rate
- Difficulty breathing
- Pale skin color
- Jaundice
- Slow growth
- Delayed puberty Other Resources. Blood Clots Sickled red blood cells can make it more likely for the blood to clot, increasing a person's chance of developing a blood clot in a deep vein, commonly in the leg, thigh, pelvis, and arm. A DVT can break off and travel to the lungs. A DVT and PE can cause serious illness, disability, and in some cases, death.

Symptoms can vary by the liver condition, but common symptoms of liver problems can include:

- Pain in the upper right side of the abdomen
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Yellowing of the eyes and skin CDC Resources to Learn More
- 5 Steps to Safer Blood Transfusions if You Have Sickle Cell Disease

### Subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit: a variety of presentations [^115d5cTY]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit is an uncommon radiologic finding. Most typically, the hemorrhage is in the superior aspect of the orbit, however, location within the orbit may vary. Subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit may be associated with trauma. Nontraumatic etiology has also been well documented. We present a series of three cases, to illustrate typical and atypical radiologic findings of subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit, both traumatic and nontraumatic. Review of the pertinent radiologic literature and its relation to the cases presented here is also provided.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal [^116PKxBC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Other studies have reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use combination birth control pills containing desogestrel (a progestin similar to the progestin in Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) than for women who use combination birth control pills that do not contain desogestrel.

It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as heart attack or stroke. Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the:

legs (deep vein thrombosis)
lungs (pulmonary embolus)
eyes (loss of eyesight)
heart (heart attack)
brain (stroke)

To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use hormonal birth control are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The figure below shows the likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who are not pregnant and do not use hormonal birth control, for women who use hormonal birth control, for pregnant women, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby.

### Uveal vascular bed in health and disease: lesions produced by occlusion of the uveal vascular bed and acute uveal ischaemic lesions seen clinically. paper 2 of 2 [^1173P4Tr]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

From studies on postmortem anatomical descriptions of the uveal vascular bed, it was generally concluded that occlusion of PCA or its branches should not produce an ischemic lesion. However, in vivo studies have recorded that the PCAs and their branches, right down to the terminal choroidal arterioles, and the choriocapillaris, have a segmental distribution in the choroid, and that PCAs and choroidal arteries function as end-arteries. This explains the basis of the occurrence of isolated inflammatory, ischemic, metastatic, and degenerative choroidal lesions, which are usually localized. Thus, in vivo studies have completely revolutionized our concept of the uveal vascular bed in disease.

### Testing and diagnosis for venous thromboembolism… [^111STnZV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

There are other conditions with signs and symptoms similar to those of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. For example, muscle injury, cellulitis, and inflammation of veins that are just under the skin can mimic the signs and symptoms of DVT. It is important to know that heart attack and pneumonia can have signs and symptoms similar to those of PE. Therefore, special tests that can look for clots in the veins or in the lungs are needed to diagnose DVT or PE. If the D-dimer test is negative, it means that the patient probably does not have a blood clot. Contrast venographyis a special type of X-ray where contrast material is injected into a large vein in the foot or ankle so that the doctor can see the deep veins in the leg and hip.

For example, if there are clots in some of the blood vessels in the lungs, the V/Q scan might show normal amounts of oxygen, but low blood flow to the portions of the lungs served by the clotted blood vessels. This test is used when CTPA is not available or when the CTPA test should not be done because it might be harmful to the particular patient. The most frequently used injectable anticoagulants are:

- Unfractionated heparin,
- Low molecular weight heparin, and
- Fondaparinux. Anticoagulants that are taken orally include:

- Warfarin
- Dabigatran
- Rivaroxaban
- Apixaban
- Edoxaban All of the anticoagulants can cause bleeding, so people taking them have to be monitored to prevent unusual bleeding. Thrombolytics Thrombolytics work by dissolving the clot.

They have a higher risk of causing bleeding compared to the anticoagulants, so they are reserved for severe cases. Inferior vena cava filter When anticoagulants cannot be used or don't work well enough, a filter can be inserted inside the inferior vena cava to capture or trap an embolus before it reaches the lungs.

### Management and follow-up of uveal effusion syndrome: a case report [^114VYyGz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

UES is more common in healthy middle-aged people, the majority of patients are male, and it is a chronic disease. The pathogenesis of UES is still not completely clear, though there are several theoretical speculations, including vortex vein occlusion, increased choroidal permeability, choroid intrinsic changes, and decreased scleral permeability. The latter is supported by histopathology. Disorder of collagen fibres in the thick sclera and an increase in the amount of mucopolysaccharide reduce the permeability of the sclera to albumin, leading to changes in osmotic gradients. Therefore, fluid is retained in the suprachoroidal and supraciliary spaces.

Clinical manifestations of UES: The early symptoms are not obvious, there is no red eye or eye swelling, vision does not change or slightly deteriorates, and visual objects have a sense of partial occlusion. At the late stage, retinal detachment involving the macula occurs, and vision deteriorates significantly. The main features include (1) ciliary body and peripheral choroidal detachment. This is the first physical sign of this disease and is also the main basis for its diagnosis. When ciliary body and peripheral choroidal detachment is suspected and fundus manifestation is not obvious, UBM examination can help with the diagnosis. The right eye fundus of this patient did not have obvious abnormality, but UBM showed ciliary body detachment. (2) It is usually accompanied by exudative detachment of the retina and subretinal fluid changes with body position changes. (3) Superficial scleral vessels are usually dilated, but there is no accompanying inflammation of the conjunctiva or anterior segment. (4) It has a chronic disease process. This disease often starts from the periphery. Patients have no subjective symptoms and usually seek treatment due to reduced macular vision caused by the disease. (5) The disease mostly occurs in both eyes at the same time, but sometimes one after the other. Therefore, both eyes need to be examined. (6) FFA shows that the leopard spot–like change is one of the bases of the diagnosis of this disease, but it is not unique to this disease. Leopard spots are usually not present at the early stage but often occur when the disease course is long. This patient did not have leopard spots in the retina at the early stage of diagnosis. After 10 months of treatment, leopard spots were observed in the retina, mostly at or below the posterior pole. FFA showed that their fluorescence was masked. Autofluorescence indicated high autofluorescence. At the same location, OCT showed local retinal pigment epithelium proliferation. (7) The enhanced depth imaging mode of OCT showed thickening of the choroid.

### Incidence of postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage after glaucoma filtration surgeries in the United States [^115SGByg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (Figures 1 and 2) is an uncommon but potentially vision-threatening eventthat may occur spontaneously,–after trauma,–or as a complication of ocular procedures including cataract surgery, secondary lens implantation, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), scleral buckling, penetrating keratoplasty, and glaucoma surgeries.–

The pathophysiology of nontraumatic suprachoroidal hemorrhage is unknown, but it is suspected to involve the rupture of a short or long posterior ciliary artery, either directly or secondary to hypotony.

The reported incidence rates of postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage after glaucoma surgeries vary from 0.7% to 6.1%. Numerous potential risk factors have been associated with the development of intraoperative and postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and the ones pertaining to glaucoma surgeries include high preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), severe postoperative hypotony, aphakia, pseudophakia, anticoagulation, white race, prior intraocular surgery, low postoperative IOP, systemic hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and pulmonary disease.

We used a large nationwide insurance claim-based database to assess the 3-month cumulative incidence rate and recorded surgical treatments of postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage after trabeculectomy and tube shunt procedures.

The patient underwent surgical exploration of the sclera of the left globe under general anesthesia to exclude the presence of a scleral wound beneath the subconjunctival hemorrhage and air bubbles; no scleral wound was found. The patient was prescribed medical treatment in the form of topical combined antibiotic and steroid eye-drops, to be administered five times daily. He was instructed to have complete bed rest with head elevation at 30 o and to avoid the Valsalva maneuver.

On his first day follow-up, the visual acuity of the left and right eyes was 6/9 and 6/6, respectively. On the second follow-up after one week, slit lamp examination revealed minimal hyphema (1 mm) which was treated medically with topical combined antibiotic and steroid eye drops administered five times daily. One week later, the hyphema was resolved and treatment was gradually withdrawn and discontinued by the fourth follow-up after four weeks. There were no neurological symptoms at any of his follow-ups.

### Ageing and ocular surface immunity [^1124Jpwe]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

1.3.1.2 Retinal nerve fibre layer

The RNFL appearance is best assessed with a red-free (green) photograph. Clinically, the RNFL can be assessed with the red-free light or a short, narrow beam of bright white light at high magnification to explore the parapapillary region. In healthy eyes, smaller retinal vessels are embedded in the RNFL. The RNFL surface is best seen if the focus is adjusted just anterior to the retinal vessels.

The fibre bundles are seen as silver striations. About two disc diameters from the disc the RNFL thins and feathers out. Slit-like, groove-like, or spindle-shaped apparent defects, narrower than the retinal vessels, may be seen in the normal fundus. The RNFL becomes less visible with age, and is more difficult to see in less pigmented fundi.

Defects are best seen within two disc diameters of the disc. Focal (wedge and slit) defects are seen as dark bands, wider than retinal vessels and extending from the disc margin, unless obscured by vessels. These focal defects are more easily seen than generalized thinning of the RNFL, which manifests as a loss of brightness and density of striations. When the RNFL is thinned, the blood vessel walls are sharp and the vessels appear to stand out in relief against a matt background. The initial abnormality in glaucoma may be either diffuse thinning or localized defects. Since the prevalence of RNFL defects is < 3% in the normal population, their presence is likely to be pathological.

1.3.1.3 Optic disc haemorrhages

The prevalence of small ('splinter') haemorrhages on or bordering the optic disc has been estimated to be ≤ 0.2% in the normal population. On the other hand, a large proportion of glaucoma patients have optic disc haemorrhages (ODHs) at one time or another (Fig. 1.8). They are very often overlooked at clinical examinations, and are easier to find in photographs. Many studies have shown that ODHs are associated with disease progression.

Figure 1.8.

1.3.1.4 Vessels at the optic disc

Narrowing of the neuroretinal tissue will change the position of the vessels at the optic disc with bending, bayoneting or baring of circumlinear vessels. Those positional changes are particularly important to observe when looking for progression, in comparison to a baseline photo.

### Subconjunctival hemorrhage: risk factors and potential indicators [^116eWq1F]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage is a benign disorder that is a common cause of acute ocular redness. The major risk factors include trauma and contact lens usage in younger patients, whereas among the elderly, systemic vascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis are more common. In patients in whom subconjunctival hemorrhage is recurrent or persistent, further evaluation, including workup for systemic hypertension, bleeding disorders, systemic and ocular malignancies, and drug side effects, is warranted.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring [^114Rm62w]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Other studies have reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use combination birth control pills containing desogestrel (a progestin similar to the progestin in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) than for women who use combination birth control pills that do not contain desogestrel.

It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as heart attack or stroke. Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the:

legs (deep vein thrombosis)
lungs (pulmonary embolus)
eyes (loss of eyesight)
heart (heart attack)
brain (stroke)

To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use hormonal birth control are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The figure below shows the likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who are not pregnant and do not use hormonal birth control, for women who use hormonal birth control, for pregnant women, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby.

### Ocular and orbital manifestations in VEXAS syndrome [^114Nq3cZ]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) revealed diffuse episcleral thickening. The patient was diagnosed with orbital inflammatory syndrome and treated with prednisone 60 mg/day, which resulted in a good response and regression of signs and symptoms within 10 days. Over the next two years, he was hospitalised three times in our department with alternating unilateral inflammatory orbital flares. He was treated successfully twice with prednisone, and once the symptoms resolved without treatment. The second presentation was accompanied by right eye posterior scleritis confirmed by typical T-sign in ultrasound (US). Lacrimal gland biopsy performed in December 2018 revealed patchy lymphocytic infiltrate composed of small T and B lymphocytes. IgG4 staining was negative.

Other systemic manifestations required another three hospitalisations between 2018 and 2021 in other departments with recurrent fevers, fatigue, weight loss, pulmonary ground glass opacities (GGOs), and one episode of laryngitis. His blood test deteriorated with pancytopenia and very high CRP (up to 236 mg/L). In May 2021, he was diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome after genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the splice acceptor site. This mutation was described in 6% of the patients. The patient received tocilizumab and 7 mg/day of prednisone, which controlled his condition well for 18 months. In March 2023, he presented to the emergency department with confusion, general weakness, and focal seizures. CT demonstrated intracranial sinus vein thrombosis. Despite anti-coagulation treatment, the patient deceased due stroke complications and respiratory failure.

### Release of experimental retinal vein occlusions by direct intraluminal injection of ocriplasmin [^114NFTN1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Several studies using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and steroids have underscored the benefit of repeat intraocular injections in restoring vision in patients with RVO. However, the gains are dependent on continued injections over a prolonged period of time extending over years for some patients. Since neither class of drug addresses the underlying cause but only provides temporary relief for the consequences of an occlusion, there remains a need to find and develop new therapeutic approaches. In the 1990s and early 2000, surgical techniques were attempted to address this issue, including the cannulation of retinal vein adjacent to the site of occlusion with the infusion of tPA. While technically feasible in central RVO, the thrombus was released in only 30% of cases. There was a trend favouring occlusions of shorter duration but successful release was also seen in some eyes with an occlusion of more than 6 months duration. Sheathotomies releasing the compression between the retinal artery and vein has also met with limited success. Given the risks of surgery and limited success, these approaches have since been abandoned. We propose in this paper, a solution that addresses two main limitations of these techniques: (1) a more effective pharmacologic means of relieving the occlusion by relying on the physiology of thrombus dissolution and (2) a more reliable, less technically challenging mode of delivery.

The lysis of a thrombus is mediated by plasmin, an active serine protease that is produced by the cleavage of plasminogen by plasminogen activator (PA) or other cleavage enzyme. While PA is produced locally by endothelial cells, plasminogen is synthesised in the liver and can only reach the site of an occlusion by means of the circulation. Once activated, plasmin has a short half-life. In the absence of a collateral blood supply, locally available plasmin will progressively be depleted and further remodelling or release of a thrombus will not be possible. The low success rate with tPA in patients with RVO is likely reflective of the lack of locally available plasminogen. Ocriplasmin, the active moiety of plasmin, when placed close to the site of the occlusion is able to dissolve the clot. However, when injected beyond a vascular branch point, it was not possible to release the thrombus as ocriplasmin was unable to reach the clot. Of note, we did not notice any increase in bleeding at the site of injection or in the peri-ocular tissue. Further studies will have to determine the minimal effective dose, and whether or not a clot reforms at the site of its release.

### Simultaneous bilateral purtscher like retinopathy with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case [^1168RuCw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

SLE is an autoimmune disease with unknown causes that often occurs in young women. It can cause various inflammatory and immune reactions. Autoantigens combine with antibodies to form immune complexes, which are deposited on vascular endothelial cells, leading to the destruction of the vascular intima and subsequent thrombosis. Its clinical manifestations are diverse, and it can affect multiple organs of the whole body, including the skin, mucosa, eyes, joints, kidneys, blood system, central nervous system, and digestive system. The ocular lesions in SLE patients include dry eyes, unilateral or bilateral defects of the visual field, vascular obstructive disease, and ischaemic optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of ocular symptoms in SLE patients remains unclear. Microvascular lesions and small vessel infarction caused by the deposition of immune complexes (such as IgG) and the production of inflammatory mediators may be related to this. Among them, retinopathy can manifest as internal bleeding of small vessels, cotton wool spots, arteriolar stenosis of the fundus, capillary plexus and vein dilation, and changes in vascular curvature, which are usually caused by the destruction of the immune complex and vascular injury to activate complement, leading to vascular abnormalities and vascular occlusion. Studies have found that SLE patients with elevated levels of serum antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) have a higher tendency for vascular occlusion, as thrombosis during SLE is closely related to APLA. In a previous case of SLE occlusivevasculitis involving both eyes, antiphospholipid antibodies were positive. The author believed that its pathogenesis is related to thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. However, in our case, phospholipid syndrome-related autoantibodies did not show abnormalities, and both anti-dsDNA and anti-SM antibodies were significantly positive. It was suggested that APLA is not the only pathogenic factor of thrombosis in SLE. A recent study revealed an important role of anti-dsDNA antibodies in promoting thrombosis through platelet dysfunction. The effects of anti-dsDNA antibodies on platelets were shown by direct activation and structural changes via FcγRIIA receptors. Activated platelets promote thrombus formation and impair the contraction of living blood clots, which is responsible for the high incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis in SLE patients. The pathogenesis of SLE complicated with Purtscher like retinopathy has been considered to be related to hypercoagulability and immune complex-mediated vasculitis. Thus, the close association between SLE retinopathy and systemic inflammatory activity emphasizes the importance of systemic immunotherapy. Some people have suggested that systematic treatment should be initiated once SLE retinopathy is identified. The sudden decrease in visual acuity in both eyes was the initial symptom in our case. After further and thorough systemic examinations, the patient was diagnosed with SLE. Different from the previously reported symptoms of SLE patients complicated with ocular arteriovenous obstruction, in this case, the first symptoms for our patient were ocular symptoms, and the patient was diagnosed with SLE after further examination found abnormal immune function and some spots of erythema on the flexion side of both hands and fingers.

### Global current practice patterns for the management of hyphema [^115RZaJm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyphema consists of blood build up in the anterior chamber (AC) of the eye resulting from injury to ciliary body and iris blood vessels. Hyphema most often occurs after trauma or surgery, but may also arise spontaneously due to coagulopathies, neovascularization, or sudden intraocular pressure changes.

The level of hyphema is one of the critical factors for grading its severity, in addition to corneal blood staining and intraocular pressure. The mildest grade of hyphema is termed microhyphema, which consists of red blood cells in the AC that are only identifiable via microscopy and/or gonioscopy. When a hyphema progresses and erythrocytes precipitate, it is considered to be a gross or layered hyphema, which is graded based upon the extent to which erythrocytes fill the AC.

In cases of traumatic ophthalmic injuries that induce hyphema, poor visual outcome (ie, < 20/40) is often due to associated injuries (such as corneal laceration or retinal detachment), but can be due to the hyphema itself in 8–33% of cases. Current treatment regimens for hyphema include cycloplegics, steroids, antifibrinolytics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, as well as activity restrictions, such as partial to complete bed rest, and protection with a rigid shield.

While various studies have investigated the comparative efficacy of specific interventions for hyphema management, uncertainties persist regarding which medications and interventions are optimal. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) provides recommendations on management standards for many common conditions in ophthalmology called the Preferred Practice Patterns©. However, these guidelines do not cover most traumatic ocular injuries, including hyphema. Additionally, inconsistencies in traumatic hyphema treatment likely persist given the heterogeneity of institutional resources on an international level.

We surveyed ophthalmic trauma experts at international institutions to summarize generally accepted principles of hyphema management and to highlight areas of variation within clinical practice.

### Nd: YAG capsulotomy for ahmed glaucoma drainage implant occlusion by the anterior capsule: a case report [^117Xxk4W]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

A third common etiology of tube occlusion is blood or fibrin clot, which can result from inflammation or bleeding that occurs postoperatively. This is particularly true in eyes with neovascular and uveitic glaucoma, both of which are common indications for glaucoma drainage device implantation and predispose patients to blood and fibrin clot formation. With blood/fibrin tube occlusion, intracameral tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) injection has shown good success. The use of tPA to lyse clots has been well established in other organ dysfunction, such as myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular clots, and pulmonary emboli. A large study by Zalta et al. demonstrated successful clearing or prevention of tube occlusion (in cases which there were blood or fibrin clots in the anterior chamber near the tube lumen but not yet occluding the tube lumen) in 32 of 36 (88.9%) eyes after glaucoma drainage device implantation with 38.9% of eyes requiring multiple injections. In eyes that have persistent clogging of the tube with blood or fibrin, surgical intervention with anterior vitrectomy and flushing of the tube may be required to clear the tube lumen and restore function.

In our case, occlusion of the tube was determined to be secondary to the anterior lens capsule. Previous case reports have described occlusion of the tube lumen by the posterior capsule or residual capsule in aphakic patients. However, this is the first case report of tube occlusion due to placement of the tube in the capsular bag during a combination phacoemulsification/Ahmed valve placement. It was decided to place the tube lumen in the ciliary sulcus given reduced risk for corneal complications in this patient with a shallow anterior chamber. Previous reports have demonstrated good IOP reduction with potential for reduced corneal complication with ciliary sulcus placement. While targeting the ciliary sulcus, the lumen of the tube was placed in the capsular bag anterior to the lens but posterior to the anterior capsule. Despite intraoperative confirmation of placement anterior to the lens implant, the lumen of the tube became occluded with the anterior capsule. This highlights the issue of tube length and the importance of consideration of potential occlusion by intraocular structures. While tube revision and anterior chamber placement of the tube is a reasonable option, the minimally invasive nature of anterior capsulotomy made this approach a viable first option.

### 23-gauge transconjunctival vitrectomy in eyes with pre-existing functioning filtering blebs [^111D7a64]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conventional 20G PPV can be accompanied by injuries such as episcleral and conjunctival vessel, thus affecting filtering bleb function. Hemorrhage can affect the pre-existing filtering bleb. Based on this principle, many existing studies reported autologous blood injection for treatment of overfiltering or leaking blebs after glaucoma surgery. Thus in case of sutureless 23G PPV, subconjunctival hemorrhage is minimized during the surgery to minimize the effect on bleb. Subconjunctival hemorrhage occurred in 27% of the study subjects, which was similar to the occurrence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in 30% of cases observed by Kunikata et al. Care is required to prevent damage to conjunctival vessel during 23G PPV, especially during sclerotomy in eyes that received trabeculectomy. When bleeding occurs at the sclerotomy site, bleeding must be minimized by positioning of epinephrine gauze. Gotzardis reported that diathermy induces temporary adhesion between conjunctiva and sclera, which could reduce the risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage and conjunctival chemosis.

The current study had some limitations. First, retrospective analysis commonly has more sources of error due to confounding factors and bias. Second, the sample size was too small because it is difficult to collect a large number of such cases. Better results can be expected by gathering more cases and comparing with the group that received 23G PPV in eyes without history of glaucoma surgery. In addition, we did not compare 23G PPV and 20G PPV.

Problem

Between two and five percent of all presentations to general practice are ophthalmic in nature. Red eye is the descriptive term representing inflammation of the anterior segment resulting in vasodilation of the superficial blood vessels, and is the most common ocular presentation in general practice. In most cases, the cause is benign. However, sometimes a red eye may indicate a sight-threatening, or in extreme cases, a life-threatening condition. According to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), the benign conditions include bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and subconjunctival haemorrhage. These make up about 70% of the primary care red eye consultations, and are subsequently over-diagnosed. The more common sight-threatening causes of a red eye include keratitis, scleritis, acute glaucoma, foreign body trauma, chemical burns, and orbital cellulitis. Studies have demonstrated that accurate diagnosis of eye conditions is achieved between 16% and 36% of the time, and up to 12% of those misdiagnosed experience adverse outcomes as a result.

In order to ensure that patients attending primary care services with a red eye are managed appropriately and safely, the NICE 'Red Eye' Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) specifies that the doctor must 'always document the history and findings of an eye examination (including negative findings). Pain, photophobia, visual acuity, and whether the condition is unilateral or bilateral, are the essential elements to be documented'. The clinician should refer the patient for same-day specialist assessment by an ophthalmologist if any red flag features are present.

The aim of this project was to ensure that an assessment for red-flag features was performed in every patient presenting to their GP with a red eye, and those with red-flag features were appropriately referred to same-day ophthalmology services, as recommended by NICE in the 'Red Eye' CKS. The timeframe within which improvement was to be demonstrated was initially set at eight weeks. The setting was a primary care health centre, located in Tower Hamlets, serving a local population of over 13,000 patients.

### Retinal hemorrhage in abusive head trauma [^117Fb85q]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Retinal hemorrhage is a cardinal manifestation of abusive head trauma. Over the 30 years since the recognition of this association, multiple streams of research, including clinical, postmortem, animal, mechanical, and finite element studies, have created a robust understanding of the clinical features, diagnostic importance, differential diagnosis, and pathophysiology of this finding. The importance of describing the hemorrhages adequately is paramount in ensuring accurate and complete differential diagnosis. Challenges remain in developing models that adequately replicate the forces required to cause retinal hemorrhage in children. Although questions, such as the effect of increased intracranial pressure, hypoxia, and impact, are still raised (particularly in court), clinicians can confidently rely on a large and solid evidence base when assessing the implications of retinal hemorrhage in children with concern of possible child abuse.

Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives.

Also, be sure to inform your healthcare professional if you smoke or are on any medications.

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Risk of developing blood clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. Serious blood clots can happen especially if you smoke, are obese, or are older than 35 years of age. Serious blood clots are more likely to happen when you:

●First start taking birth control pills

●Restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more

In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### A rare case of acute angle closure due to spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage secondary to loss of anti-coagulation control: a case report [^111688TX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The case describes a rare entity of acute angle closure due to spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage secondary to loss of anti-coagulation control. Most of the previously reported cases of angle-closure glaucoma from massive hemorrhagic retinal or choroidal detachments have failed to respond to medical therapy and needed enucleation or retrobulbar injection treatment for pain. Early recognition of this rare entity is vital in preserving the function of the eye. Aggressive medical and surgical treatment with suprachoroidal haematoma drainage offers some chance of preserving the eye and some of its function.

Intravitreal injections — technique and intra-procedural risks specify that "The needle should be inserted perpendicularly through the sclera with the tip aimed toward the center of the globe to avoid the posterior lens", and "Injections are generally performed inferotemporally or superotemporally to optimize exposure and to avoid damage to the retina and other eye structures". Iatrogenic injuries described include that "the lens capsule can become damaged during the injection and a traumatic cataract can result, requiring subsequent cataract surgery", with possible "complications during cataract surgery caused by posterior capsule rupture", as well as "The retina may also be damaged, resulting in tears or even a detachment that requires surgical repair", and "corneal abrasions and intraocular hemorrhages". During the procedure, intraocular pressure (IOP) considerations are that "IOP can increase transiently, and the ophthalmologist may need to reduce IOP", which "may require an anterior chamber paracentesis", wherein "the surgeon must insert a needle into the anterior chamber of the eye to remove fluid and reduce the pressure", and this "procedure carries many of the same risks of the first injection".

### Massive spontaneous suprachoroidal hemorrhage in a patient with type 1 chronic myeloid leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: case report and review of the literature [^112rm7YM]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) is a rare but vision-threatening complication of intraocular surgery and trauma whereby extensive hemorrhaging in the potential space between the choroid and sclera mechanically brings the retina into near or complete apposition and in severe cases, extrudes intraocular contents through open wounds. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage typically occurs secondarily to intraocular surgery, both intraoperatively and postoperatively, and in patients experiencing physical trauma.

Although rare, SCH has also been described to occur spontaneously but typically occurs in association with specific ocular or systemic risk factors. Commonly encountered systemic risk factors include old age, increased venous pressure during the Valsalva maneuver and coughing, hypertension, and the use of antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and thrombocytopenia. Intraocular risk factors include high myopia, acute hypotony, glaucoma, and choroidal lesions, such as hemangiomas and melanoma.

Indications for drainage of an appositional SCH include central choroidal apposition, a flat anterior chamber, associated retinal detachment, uncontrolled elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and severe pain. In nonappositional cases, surgical and conservative approaches with frequent monitoring of hemorrhage absorption have been well described.

In this report and review of the literature, we describe a case of spontaneous suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SSCH) with near apposition of the retina in a patient with thrombocytopenia secondary to type 1 chronic myeloid leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma that was successfully treated with conservative therapy and close monitoring. Our case illustrates the importance of a prompt systemic workup as well as a multidisciplinary approach to the management of SSCH before planning surgical intervention.

### Ageing and ocular surface immunity [^113nmGDp]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Pigmentation: pigment is found predominantly in the posterior meshwork. It is seen in adults, rarely before puberty and the extent can be highly variable. The most common conditions associated with dense pigmentation are: pseudoexfoliation syndrome, pigment dispersion syndrome, previous trauma, previous laser treatment of the iris, uveitis and after an acute angle-closure attack.

Blood vessels: these are often found in normal iridocorneal angles. They characteristically have a radial or circumferential orientation, have few anastomoses and do not run across the scleral spur. They can be seen most easily in subjects with blue irides. Pathological vessels are usually thinner, have a disordered orientation and may run across the scleral spur to form a neovascular membrane. Abnormal vessels are also seen in Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis and chronic anterior uveitis.

Schlemm's canal: is not normally visible, though it may be seen if it contains blood. Blood reflux from episcleral veins may occur in cases of carotid-cavernous fistulae, Sturge Weber syndrome, venous compression, ocular hypotony, sickle cell disease or due to suction from the goniolens.

Scleral spur: is of white appearance and located between the pigmented TM and the ciliary body.

Iris processes: are present in one third of normal eyes, more evident in younger subjects. When numerous and prominent they may represent a form of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome/ anomaly. They are distinguished from goniosynechiae which are thicker and wider and may go beyond the scleral spur.

Ciliary band and iris root: the iris insertion is usually at the anterior face of the ciliary body, though the site is variable. The ciliary band may be wide, as in myopia, aphakia or following trauma, or narrow or not seen as in hyperopia and anterior insertion of the iris.

### Pachychoroid disease: review and update [^1152o5sj]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

New observations related to choroidal venous alterations

In our previous review, we highlighted the following characteristics shared among eyes with pachychoroid disease: 1) increased CT; 2) presence of pachyvessels (discussed in "New observations related to choroidal venous alterations" a); 3) inner choroid attenuation; and 4) choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. While the emphasis on CT has since then declined, recent findings, including ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging, have provided further understanding related to the nature of choroidal venous congestion. Inner choroidal ischemia continues to be regarded as an important sequela of pachychoroid disease which may result in neovascular complications and macular atrophy. (Fig. 1) The role of the sclera in influencing pachychoroid disease has also gained attention, with cumulative evidence suggesting increased thickness of both the anterior and posterior sclera to be risk factors for pachychoroid disease. Thickened sclera could impose resistance to venous outflow to the vortex veins, and to the transscleral passage of proteins and fluid.

Fig. 1
Examples of imaging findings related to choroidal alterations in the pachychoroid disease spectrum.

Figure 1a shows the presence of pachyvessels which appear as prominent choroidal veins with large caliber crossing the horizontal watershed on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Areas of reduced filling are indicated by white arrows (a). This eye is also imaged with OCT (b) and en face 12 × 12 mm OCTA (c, d). Presence of subretinal fluid and pachyvessels within a thickened choroid can be observed in (b). c The pachyvessels can be observed with en face OCT using a choroidal slab and closely correspond to those seen on ICGA in (a). d Several areas of choriocapillaris flow impairment can be observed with en face OCTA using the choriocapillaris slab (white arrows). These areas correspond closely to the areas of reduced filling on ICGA in (a). e, f Ultra-widefield (UWF) ICGA can be used to evaluate the arrangement of vortex veins. The example in (e) shows a dilated and congested vortex vein in the inferotemporal quadrant. Anastomosis can be observed between the inferotemporal and superotemporal quadrants (white arrow). The example in (f) shows widespread dilated and congested vortex veins in all four quadrants. Multiple anastomosis can be observed around the optic disc.

### Clot contraction: compression of erythrocytes into tightly packed polyhedra and redistribution of platelets and fibrin [^1118un5X]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Contraction of blood clots is necessary for hemostasis and wound healing and to restore flow past obstructive thrombi, but little is known about the structure of contracted clots or the role of erythrocytes in contraction. We found that contracted blood clots develop a remarkable structure, with a meshwork of fibrin and platelet aggregates on the exterior of the clot and a close-packed, tessellated array of compressed polyhedral erythrocytes within. The same results were obtained after initiation of clotting with various activators and also with clots from reconstituted human blood and mouse blood. Such close-packed arrays of polyhedral erythrocytes, or polyhedrocytes, were also observed in human arterial thrombi taken from patients. The mechanical nature of this shape change was confirmed by polyhedrocyte formation from the forces of centrifugation of blood without clotting. Platelets (with their cytoskeletal motility proteins) and fibrin(ogen) (as the substrate bridging platelets for contraction) are required to generate the forces necessary to segregate platelets/fibrin from erythrocytes and to compress erythrocytes into a tightly packed array. These results demonstrate how contracted clots form an impermeable barrier important for hemostasis and wound healing and help explain how fibrinolysis is greatly retarded as clots contract.

### The eye and the heart [^117632KQ]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion

Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is often referred to as retinal venous thrombosis. However, increasing evidence now indicates that RVO might occur without thrombosis and that if thrombosis occurs, it might be secondary. The risk factors for RVO are similar to those for arterial occlusions, and anticoagulation treatmentsdo not protect against RVO. Reduced OBF, glaucoma, PVD, and stress increase the risk of RVO and circulating ET-1 levels are increased in nearly all cases. In addition, OBF is also very often reduced and RVP increased in the contralateral clinically non-affected eye. Molecules from the circulating blood diffusing into the ONH, or produced locally either by the diseased arteries or by the hypoxic tissue, lead to a local venous constriction and thereby increase RVP. This leads to the so-called praestasis syndrome and eventually to a clinical picture of RVO (Figure 10). The weakened BRB further contributes to retinal oedema and haemorrhages. The positive clinical effect of anti-VEGF therapy in humans, as well as the positive effect of ET-1 blockers in experimental animals, supports this assumption.

Figure 10
Pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion: At the lamina cribrosa, the central artery and central vein are topographically very close and share a common adventitia (middle). This enables a molecular cross talk between the two vessels (right). Endothelin-1 (blue), for example, can diffuse from the ailing artery as well as from the adjacent hypoxic tissue to the very sensitive vein, leading to venous constriction.

### Differential diagnosis of pseudohypopyon and discussion of extranodal natural killer / T-cell lymphoma presenting as hypopyon panuveitis [^114WBesr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Main text

First: the definition or the nomenclature of the anterior chamber collection was defined as "hypopyon" and such terminology does not seem to be correct. The term "hypopyon", a layered meniscus formation in the anterior chamber of the eye, is an etiological definition, indicating an advanced exudative stage of an acute intraocular inflammation that rapidly responds to corticosteroids. Therefore, when hypopyon originates from autoimmune non-infectious uveitis or by exogenous and endogenous microbial infections, it classically presents with severe perilimbal (circumcorneal) dusky red hyperaemia with a violaceous hue (ciliary injection or flush) along with conjunctival, episcleral and deep scleral vasodilatations. The term "warm hypopyon" is used for such a "hot disease". If we carefully look at Fig. 1 in the presented case, the involved left eye of the woman is typically white and there are no signs of the above-mentioned acute anterior uveitis such as ciliary injection. In addition, the patient did not complain of ocular pain, lacrimation or photophobia, all of which are cardinal symptoms of acute uveitis. Taken together, all the abovementioned symptoms and findings along with a painless decline in her vision should have suggested a non-infective etiology for this unique case. In addition, sediments in microbial endophthalmitis cause "purulent and yellow-coloured hypopyon formation", which results in pus formation typically heaped up centrally rather than at its edges. Such macroscopic signs to the naked eye should have alerted the authors during the examination against infective endophthalmitis.

### Incidental branch retinal artery occlusion on optical coherence tomography angiography presenting as segmental optic atrophy in a child: a case report [^116UhZnH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A visually asymptomatic 10-year-old boy presented with an inferonasal visual field defect in the left eye (Fig. 1a). He had no significant medical history other than his mother's gestational diabetes. His family history was unremarkable for any ocular diseases and his parents showed a normal fundus on examination. His best-corrected visual acuities were 20/20 in both eyes (OU). Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light without relative afferent pupillary defect. He had normal color vision OU. Detailed fundoscopic examination revealed segmental pallor of the left optic disc, thinning of the superotemporal rim, a relative superior entrance of the central retinal artery and superior peripapillary scleral halo (Fig. 1b and c). Fluorescein angiography showed patchy filling delays in the corresponding disc area but no other retinal vascular abnormality was found (Fig. 1d). SD OCT (Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) using segmentation analysis showed sectoral absence of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the superotemporal quadrant of the retina (Fig. 2a and b). Additionally, marked thinning of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) were detected (Fig. 2c). Decreased P100 amplitude in the left eye was observed on visual evoked potential (VEP). OCTA (Spectralis OCT-A, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) revealed attenuated superficial (Fig. 3a) and intermediate/deep capillary plexuses (Fig. 3b). The main branches in corresponding well-demarcated lesions were preserved. Consequently, his segmental optic disc pallor and inner retinal hypoplasia were presumed to be caused by an incidental BRAO. To evaluate risk factors for retinal arterial occlusion, laboratory investigations were performed including complete blood count with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum lipids, metabolic panel, liver and renal function tests, which were all normal. A thrombophilia screening revealed that homocysteine, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden assay, antithrombin III, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, lipoprotein A and complement levels were normal. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies were absent with no evidence of vasculitis. Cardiovascular work-up including echocardiography showed no abnormalities and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were within normal limits.

### Ocular manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^1159ZjHD]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by a heterogenous group of antibodies directed against negatively charged phospholipids including antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and β-2 glycoprotein I (aβ-2-GP1). The major features of this disorder include arterial and venous thrombosis and recurrent fetal loss. The vasculature of the eye is frequently involved and may be the presenting manifestation. A diagnosis of APS should be considered in a young patients without traditional thromboembolic risk factors presenting with ocular vaso-occlusive disease. Management of these patients involves a team-approach with a haematologist/oncologist or rheumatologist to manage the coagulation status of these patients to prevent further systemic vascular occlusions.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage — presentation and field management are summarized as follows: Bleeding between the conjunctiva and sclera causes a collection of blood that appears bright red, and subconjunctival hemorrhages are most often caused by straining (during sneezing, coughing, vomiting, or toileting), rubbing of the eye, or due to barotrauma if diving. Although impressive looking, this condition is typically benign and it will resolve in days to weeks without treatment, and unless there are signs of a ruptured globe or basilar skull fracture, no backcountry treatment or evacuation is required.

### Thicknesses of sclera and lamina cribrosa in patients with central retinal vein occlusion [^116uewns]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate thicknesses of sclera and lamina cribrosa (LC) in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

Method

Thirty-two patients with CRVO (mean age 62.2 ± 11.6 years, women/men 18/14) and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included into the study. Scleral thickness was measured at scleral spur and at 1 to 3 mm from scleral spur in four quadrants (temporal, nasal, super, and inferior) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Lamina cribrosa was measured using optic disk enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography.

Results

The sclera was thicker in affected eyes of the CRVO group than healthy subjects at scleral spur in four quadrants (738.7 ± 30.9 µm vs. 702 ± 30.8 µm in temporal, 700.4 ± 19.7 µm vs. 673 ± 13.7 µm in superior, 693 ± 19.3 µm vs. 665.3 ± 24.2 µm in nasal, 810.7 ± 28.9 µm vs. 784.5 ± 23.7 µm in inferior quadrants, respectively; P < 0.05 for all). Lamina cribrosa thickness in affected eyes of the CRVO group was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects (285.2 ± 12.7 µm vs. 266.4 ± 10.7 µm, respectively; P < 0.01). The correlation between scleral thickness and LC thickness was moderate at scleral spur of temporal and superior quadrants of affected eyes (r = 0.510 and r = 0.420, respectively).

Conclusion

Thicknesses of sclera and LC are increased in the CRVO, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

### Role of fundus autofluorescence imaging in the management of submacular hemorrhage [^112WHnHQ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study elucidated the significance of FAF in conjunction with other retinal imaging techniques, namely OCT and CFP, in eyes with SMH. The study aimed to determine the significance of FAF in eyes with SMH in order to anticipate the outcome of SMH displacement from beneath the fovea after intervention. The study observed that the occurrence of hyperautofluorescence of SMH on FAF during initial examination was linked to unfavourable outcomes. Conversely, the presence of hypoautofluoroscence of the SMH on FAF was associated with successful displacement of the heme, regardless of the treatment employed.

In order to comprehensively understand the retinal imaging findings discussed in the study, it is imperative to possess a fundamental understanding of the alterations occurring in the extravasated subretinal blood. The extravascular subretinal space experiences leakage or extravasation of blood as a result of an acute injury to retinal or choroidal circulation, regardless of the underlying cause. Subsequently, two events are triggered. The first event involves the activation of the coagulation cascade through platelet activation and aggregation, leading to the formation of a fibrin meshwork within the blood vessels to impede continuing hemorrhage. The second event pertains to alterations in the blood within the subretinal space. The fresh subretinal blood contains a mixture of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The composition of this blood undergoes alterations over time. With time, the red blood cells located in the subretinal space experience ongoing disintegration, referred to as haemolysis. Upon the completion of the haemolysis process, the initially red-coloured fresh blood undergoes a transformation, resulting in a change to a yellow hue within the subretinal space. Concurrently, there is a persistent buildup of fibrin. Therefore, the concentration of fibrin in a recently formed subretinal blood clot is either absent or minimal, whereas in an older blood clot, it is significantly elevated. The absence of fibrin and minimal hemolysis contribute to the characteristic red appearance and increased mobility of a recent subretinal hemorrhage. This type of hemorrhage exhibits heterogeneous hypo and hyperreflectivity with back shadowing on OCT and hypoautofluoroscence on FAF. In contrast, an older altered blood presents as yellow, with reduced mobility. It displays homogeneous hyperreflectivity within the subretinal space on OCT and hyperautofluorescence on FAF. These differences can be attributed to the accumulation of fibrin and complete haemolysis in the older hemorrhage. The observed hypoautofluoroscence and hyperautofluorescence patterns observed on FAF in eyes with recent and longstanding SMH can be attributed to the inherent properties of the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of whole human blood, fibrinogen, and fibrin. The fluorescence spectrum of whole human blood spans a wavelength range of 850 to 1,500 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 808 nm. On the other hand, fibrinogen and fibrin exhibit a fluorescence emission spectrum within the wavelength range of 300 to 400 nm, with the emission peak occurring at 344 nm. Therefore, it can be inferred that short wavelength FAF imaging is a viable method for comprehending the heme properties by evaluating the levels of whole blood and fibrin present. This information could potentially assist the clinician in making an informed decision regarding the selection of the most suitable treatment modality for the displacement of blood located beneath the fovea within the subretinal space.

Traumatic hyphema — blood in the anterior chamber following trauma — has wilderness care centered on safe evacuation and intraocular pressure (IOP) management. There is no difference between ambulation and complete rest on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleeding, and in the wilderness, activity should be restricted to walking only. Historically, cycloplegics (atropine 1%, every 8 h) and topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1%, 4 times a day) have been used to decrease inflammation and improve patient comfort and should be considered, and patients who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhaging and these agents could be considered. If clinical signs of increased IOP are present, the addition of topical or systemic IOP-lowering medications is indicated, and in the wilderness setting, acetazolamide may be used at a dose of 500 mg orally twice daily. Supportive measures include keeping the head elevated above 30 degrees at all times, using analgesics and antiemetics as clinically indicated, and we recommend avoiding the use of NSAIDs; near work or tasks are not recommended and a rigid shield is not effective in preventing rebleeding but may be used to prevent further trauma. If a hyphema is found, emergent evacuation for expert consultation is recommended.

### A case of recurrent bloody tears [^1135dbnQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Well-known causes of blood-tinged epiphora are conjunctival lesions, tumors of the lacrimal apparatus, and systemic bleeding disorders. We describe an unusual patient who presented with recurrent episodes of bloody tearing which began following an erythema multiforme-like drug eruption. He experienced chronic conjunctivitis which resulted in a few minor symblephara. One year later, the patient developed attacks of bloody tearing. All clinical, radiologic, and laboratory investigations related to bloody epiphora were within normal limits except for a mild, nonspecific chronic inflammatory reaction in the perivascular tissues of the lacrimal gland and orbital soft tissues. Also, an increase in vascular permeability and contrast extravasation on carotid angiography was detected. High-dose vitamin C was administered. The patient continued to have unilateral bloody tears intermittently for two years, but the episodes became much less frequent and had resolved by three years. It is conceivable that increased vascular permeability following the systemic inflammatory process could have played a role in the etiology of recurrent bloody tears in this atypical patient.

### Medical interventions for traumatic hyphema [^117GG7ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber, the space between the cornea and iris, following significant injury to the eye. Hyphema may be associated with significant complications that uncommonly cause permanent vision loss. Complications include elevated intraocular pressure, corneal blood staining, anterior and posterior synechiae, and optic nerve atrophy. People with sickle cell trait or disease may be particularly susceptible to increases in intraocular pressure and optic atrophy. Rebleeding is associated with an increase in the rate and severity of complications.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of various medical interventions in the management of traumatic hyphema.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 3); MEDLINE Ovid; Embase.com; PubMed (1948 to March 2022); the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The last date of the search was 22 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by the electronic and manual searches. We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared various medical (non-surgical) interventions versus other medical interventions or control groups for the treatment of traumatic hyphema following closed-globe trauma. We applied no restrictions on age, gender, severity of the closed-globe trauma, or level of visual acuity at time of enrollment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 23 randomized and seven quasi-randomized studies with a total of 2969 participants. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (systemic and topical aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity for any intervention, whether measured within two weeks (short term) or for longer periods. In a meta-analysis of two trials, we found no evidence of an effect of aminocaproic acid on long-term visual acuity (RR 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.29) or final visual acuity measured up to three years after the hyphema (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Oral tranexamic acid appeared to provide little to no benefit on visual acuity in four trials (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.25). The remaining trials evaluated the effects of various interventions on short-term visual acuity; none of these interventions was measured in more than one trial. No intervention showed a statistically significant effect (RRs ranged from 0.75 to 1.10). Similarly, visual acuity measured for longer periods in four trials evaluating different interventions was also not statistically significant (RRs ranged from 0.82 to 1.02). The evidence supporting these findings was of low or very low certainty. Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60), as assessed in six trials with 330 participants. A sensitivity analysis omitting two studies not using an intention-to-treat analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.08). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10) in two trials with 131 participants. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as low. Systemic tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.53) in seven trials with 754 participants, as did aminomethylbenzoic acid (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.41), as reported in one study. Evidence to support an associated reduction in risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e. corneal blood staining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compared with placebo. We found no evidence of an effect on the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose. The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of systemic aminocaproic acid compared with no use, but this outcome was not altered by any other intervention. The available evidence on usage of systemic or topical corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials. We found no evidence of an effect between a single versus binocular patch on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed. We also found no evidence of an effect on the risk of secondary hemorrhage between ambulation and complete bed rest.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity of any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although the evidence was limited, people with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhage. However, hyphema took longer to clear in people treated with systemic aminocaproic acid. There is no good evidence to support the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the management of traumatic hyphema, other than possibly to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage. The potentially long-term deleterious effects of secondary hemorrhage are unknown. Similarly, there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or non-drug interventions (such as patching, bed rest, or head elevation) in the management of traumatic hyphema. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value.

### Outcomes in patients with suprachoroidal hemorrhage after anterior segment surgery [^114tWYio]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SCH remains a severe potential complication of intraocular surgery and has a guarded visual prognosis. In eyes with non-appositional SCH, observation remains a reasonable management strategy. However, in eyes with appositional SCH, management remains more challenging and surgical intervention may be indicated.

### Red blood cell aggregation within a blood clot causes platelet-independent clot shrinkage [^117TDBAF]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contraction or retraction of blood clots is the process of clot shrinkage and structural remodeling, that occurs both in vitro and in vivo. It affects the course and outcomes of thrombosis, and is also important in hemostasis. Contraction of blood clots occurs by activated platelets attached to fibrin fibers. Platelet contractility is driven by the interaction of nonmuscle myosin IIA with actin. The intracellular force is transmitted to fibrin via the integrin αIIbβ3, resulting in compaction of the clot. During contraction, a blood clot undergoes redistribution of components, such that the platelet-fibrin meshwork is accumulated at the clot periphery, whereas red blood cells (RBCs) are condensed within the clot coreand become tightly packed to a polyhedral shape, hence named "polyhedrocytes" or "piezocytes".,

The role of RBCs in clot contraction remains poorly understood. The extent and rate of clot shrinkage are inversely related to the volume fraction of RBCs in blood (hematocrit). At the same time, the deformation of RBCs activates the mechanosensitive membrane cationic channels Piezo1, followed by reduction of RBCs in size and surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, increasing the generation of endogenous thrombin, and increased thrombin activity further augments platelet contractility. Notably, blood clot contraction depends not only on the quantity but also on the quality of RBCs, such that RBCs with increased rigidity reduce clot contraction compared with normal softer RBCs.

Analysis of in vitro blood clots and in vivo thrombi has shown that often RBCs comprise the main constituent, sometimes reaching > 80% of the clot volume fraction, although after clot contraction the RBC packing is extremely tight, owing to platelet-induced compression. It is unknown whether RBC aggregation can play a role in blood clot formation and structural rearrangements.

### Topical and subconjunctival anesthesia versus topical anesthesia alone in patients with senile cataracts undergoing phacoemulsification: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111MH8WU]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subconjunctival lidocaine injection was associated with a higher occurrence of anesthetic technique-related subconjunctival hemorrhage (Lidocaine vs. Control: 30.7% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001). The incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in our study aligns with data reported in a previously published study (24.4%). Because patients in both groups received a subconjunctival injection, the increased incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in the Lidocaine group could be partially attributed to mechanical trauma from the injection. We hypothesized that the higher rate of subconjunctival hemorrhage in the Lidocaine group was attributable to blood vessel injury resulting from the drug or its acidic solution. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is an acceptable complication because it is self-limited, does not require treatment, and does not result in long-term consequences. Although scleral perforation associated with subconjunctival injection has been reported, this complication is extremely rare, and it did not occur in our study.

The addition of subconjunctival lidocaine injection both reduced postoperative pain and significantly improved patients' cooperativity (score difference [95% CI]: −0.25 [− 0.49, − 0.01]). Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies highlighting the correlation between better pain control and improved patient cooperation. Patient cooperation could be especially crucial for ophthalmologists during their learning curve periods. Moreover, in developing countries, in which the lack of anesthesiologists requires ophthalmologists to perform both anesthesia and surgery, patient cooperation assumes even greater importance. Lower patient cooperation was also associated with a higher frequency of complications. Although topical anesthesia is a simple technique, surgeons must carefully weigh the trade-off between cooperation and reduced postoperative pain against the simplicity of the procedure and potential patient discomfort during subconjunctival injection.

### ChatGPT-assisted classification of postoperative bleeding following microinvasive glaucoma surgery using electronic health record data [^112UfAsL]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Microinvasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGSs) represent a significant advancement in glaucoma treatment, offering an alternative to traditional surgical approaches with advantages such as subconjunctival tissue preservation and a lower rate of complications. As the field of glaucoma surgery continues to evolve, the options provided by MIGS are increasingly favored over traditional glaucoma surgeries in mild to moderate disease. Although infrequent, complications may arise after MIGS. Blood reflux into the anterior chamber is a relatively common postoperative occurrence during these procedures, with rates estimated to range from 0.5% to 100% depending on the procedure and device used. However, patterns of hemorrhage resolution have not been studied. Hemorrhage is often noted in initial postoperative examinations as the presence of a hyphema, blood clot, or red blood cells (RBCs) circulating in the anterior chamber (microhyphema), which typically resolve spontaneously within the first 2 weeks without the need for additional intervention. In prospective studies, such as those regarding the Hydrus and iStent devices, postoperative hemorrhagic events (HEs) were reported collectively as "hyphema" without distinguishing between types or their clinical significance. In addition, the time required for resolution of these HEs are rarely monitored or discussed. Hemorrhagic events are typically documented in the anterior chamber examination of the electronic health record (EHR) in a narrative text format.

### Global current practice patterns for the management of hyphema [^112h1feE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The data reported here highlight that the controversies previously described in hyphema management currently persist internationally. Although we witnessed several areas of general consensus, including the use of topical steroids and cycloplegics, and the recommendation for head elevation/sleeping upright, we observed areas of variation in preferences for the administration and types of medications used for hyphema cases, indications for surgical interventions, as well as activity limitations and typical disposition of patients. Previous investigations thus far have shown management techniques to affect secondary hemorrhage rates, but not necessarily improve visual outcomes. However, evidence-based management protocols are still needed to reduce clinical waste, limit unnecessary exposure to medication side effects or adverse surgical events, and ensure access to optimal care.

Steroids are widely considered a mainstay of hyphema treatment to prevent rebleeds and synechiae formation, but there is conflicting evidence for their effectiveness in this setting. Several controlled prospective studies found no association between systemic steroid use, particularly prednisone, and the incidence of secondary hemorrhage or final visual outcomes after traumatic hyphema. More recently, a systematic review was unable to determine efficacy due to a lack of statistical power in existing trials. In another meta-analysis, however, steroids (either topical or systemic) were found to effectively reduce secondary hemorrhage risk, but not to improve final visual acuity. Other trials have found that systemic and/or topical steroids may be beneficial for preventing rebleeds. Despite a lack of conclusive evidence, the vast majority of experts in our study routinely administered topical steroids to patients with gross hyphema or microhyphema (n = 34, 94.4%, and n = 29, 80.6%, respectively). Because topical steroids have limited side effects compared to systemic administration, they would be preferred if they are found to be similarly effective. Investigations are needed to compare the efficacy of topical steroids relative to control groups without steroid treatment and to systemic therapy to determine if topical steroids alone are sufficient, as well as determine an optimal dosing regimen.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (cyclafem 1 / 35) [^113nqT7x]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Do not use Cyclafem™ 1/35 (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you have any of the following conditions:

A history of heart attack or stroke
Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes
A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs
An inherited problem that makes your blood clot more than normal
Chest pain (angina pectoris)
Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina
Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your healthcare professional)
Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill
Liver tumor (benign or cancerous)
Known or suspected pregnancy

Tell your healthcare professional if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your healthcare professional can recommend a safer method of birth control.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have had:

Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram
Diabetes
Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides
High blood pressure
Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy
Mental depression
Gallbladder, liver, heart or kidney disease
History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods

Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives.

### Rapid and spontaneous resolution of hemorrhagic macular hole retinal detachment and subretinal hemorrhages in an eye with pathologic myopia: a case report [^11119xbN]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the retinal reattachment in our case occurred within 5 days together with a rapid resolution and shrinkage of the CNV without any treatment. Earlier studies reported a spontaneous resolution of a MHRD without active CNV (Table 1), however it required a much longer time of one month to 4 years. As a possible mechanism for the rapid and spontaneous resolution of both MHRD and active CNV, the presence of subretinal blood and vitreous may be considered. Several studies have reported that the application of autologous adjuvant blood/serum components during MH surgery with or without a retinal detachment improved the hole closure rate by facilitating the wound healing process. Therefore, we suggest that a blood clot accumulated around the residual posterior vitreous membrane facilitated the MH closure and then the retinal detachment resolution. Another possible cause is that the release of vitreous traction, some of the subretinal fluid may have escaped, and the retinal pigment epithelium may have pumped out the subretinal fluid to help promote rapid attachment due to the lack of macular traction.

Table 1
Comparisons between the findings of previous studies and our study in eyes with pathologic myopia that had a natural resolution of macular hole retinal detachment

MHRD macular hole retinal detachment, ERM epi-retinal membrane, MH macular hole, SRF sub-retinal fluid, CNV choroidal neovascularization

We describe our findings of a rare case of pathologic myopia where an active CNV may have triggered a MHRD followed by a rapid and spontaneous resolution of both conditions in 5 days. Future detailed and long-term investigations using multimodal imaging on such inflammatory conditions will be required to determine the pathogenesis of the MHRD in eyes with pathologic myopia.

### Outcomes in patients with suprachoroidal hemorrhage after anterior segment surgery [^112qbMhR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

The institutional review board of the University of Miami approved the study protocol, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declarations of Helsinki. This study involved the retrospective review of medical records and did not have prospective contact with potential study subjects prior to acquisition of the requested data. As a result, the University of Miami approved a waiver of consent in accordance with US Code of Federal Regulations guidelines. The study design was a retrospective case series of patients with suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurring after anterior segment surgery. SCH after trauma, PPV, or retinal detachment (RD) surgery were not included. Diagnosis of suprachoroidal hemorrhage was made clinically and followed by confirmation on B-scan ultrasonography. Images were individually reviewed by the physicians. Serous choroidals were ruled out by analysis of the B-scan images. Measured preoperative variables included age, sex, hypertension, anticoagulation status, lens status, surgery type causing SCH, presenting VA, presenting intraocular pressure (with hypotony defined as IOP < 8mmHg), concurrent pathology on presentation (including flat anterior chamber, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment), and duration of apposition. Intraoperative variables included management of SCH (observation, delayed drainage, or delayed vitrectomy (PPV)), while post-operative variables included VA and IOP on follow-up. Observation was defined as treatment limited to non-surgical interventions. Delayed drainage and PPV were not defined by a given number of days, but rather by the surgeon's decision to observe/monitor with serial ultrasonography, and then to intervene surgically once there was evidence of liquefaction of the clot. Management decisions were surgeon preference and did not follow a prospective protocol. The following logMAR assignments were utilized: counting fingers = 2.0, hand motion = 2.3, light perception = 2.6, and no light perception = 3. VA and IOP "at last follow-up" were determined only from patients with greater than 3 months of follow-up (101 and 94 patients, respectively). Student's t -test and Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney u -test were used for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. Spearman's rank order correlation was used for continuous data. Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

### Red blood cell aggregation within a blood clot causes platelet-independent clot shrinkage [^114PBT1J]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

For detailed methods, see Section 1 of the supplemental Material.

Platelet-depleted blood clots and dynamics of RBC-induced clot shrinkage

The mixtures of washed RBCs and platelet-free plasma (PFP) from the same donor referred to as platelet-depleted reconstituted blood samples (supplemental Figures 1–3) were clotted to follow subsequent clot shrinkage. Briefly, clot formation and further compaction either in the blood (natural or reconstituted) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) samples were induced by adding 2 mM CaCl 2 and 1 U/mL human thrombin. The thrombin-activated blood or plasma samples were transferred to cuvettes prelubricated with a residual layer of a detergent to prevent fibrin sticking to the walls. The cuvette was placed into a chamber (37°C) of the thrombodynamics analyzer (HemaCore), and the clot size was tracked for 60 minutes. The serial clot images were converted computationally into kinetic curves (relative extent of clot shrinkage vs time) that were analyzed for the extent of clot contraction/shrinkage at the end point (60 minutes), area under the curve, average velocity of clot contraction/shrinkage, and the lag time (supplemental Figure 4).

Measurement of tension generated by platelet-depleted blood clots

Clots from reconstituted platelet-depleted blood samples were formed between horizontal rheometer plates, and the clot tension was measured continuously as a negative normal (vertical) pulling force. The RBC-related tension was determined as the difference between the maximal normal forces generated by the clots in the presence and absence of RBCs.

### Looking into the eyes of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^113LfXTm]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) should be considered in all patients with recurrent systemic or ocular thrombosis in the absence of known risk factors. Because of the frequent ocular involvement in APS patients (as many as 80%), an ophthalmologic assessment should become a routine part of the clinical work-up of all patients in whom APS is highly suspected. The presence of isolated ocular thrombosis with persistently increased titers of antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered as definite APS. Ocular involvement in APS is frequently associated with other manifestations of the central nervous system (CNS), such as transient ischemic attack or cerebral vascular events. Diagnostic tools are needed to better establish a diagnosis of retinal vascular thrombosis. The treatment of isolated ocular APS should be based on the same principles as in all patients with systemic APS. Anticoagulation is aimed to prevent recurrent ocular or cerebral thromboses.

### Retina summary benchmarks – 2024 [^114XFRNY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Retinal vein occlusions (initial evaluation) — history should capture the location and duration of vision loss; current medications, history of smoking, recreational drug use; medical history including systemic hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, coagulopathies, thrombotic disorders, pulmonary embolus; and ocular history including glaucoma, other ophthalmologic disorders, ocular injections, and prior surgery. Physical exam emphasizes pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect tied to ischemia and neovascularization risk, assessment of fine abnormal new iris vessels with slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure and gonioscopy prior to dilation with special attention in ischemic CRVO or elevated IOP or high iris neovascularization risk, binocular funduscopic evaluation of the posterior pole, and evaluation of the peripheral retina and vitreous for which slit-lamp biomicroscopy is recommended and far peripheral assessment is best performed using indirect or a three-mirror contact lens.

### Bilateral large subconjunctival haemorrhages unmasking immune thrombocytopenic purpura during retinopathy of prematurity screening [^116ePVHN]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Although thrombocytopenia is known to be associated with pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is rare in infancy and not reported to occur with ROP. A preterm infant with aggressive posterior ROP developed bilateral massive subconjunctival haemorrhage after scleral indentation during screening. On evaluation, the infant was found to have severe ITP. Following intravenous transfusion of platelets and immunoglobulin, platelet counts improved and subconjunctival haemorrhage resolved over time. This case highlights the unusual presentation of ITP and also discusses the association of thrombocytopenia with ROP. Ophthalmologists should get prompt haematological work-up of such occurrences.

### Prevalence and causes of subconjunctival hemorrhage in children [^116LeZNS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Subconjunctival hemorrhage (SCH) is a reported sign of occult abusive injury, but there are limited published data about SCH during childhood. We sought to determine the prevalence and causes of SCH in children.

Methods

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of children seen by pediatric ophthalmologists in an outpatient setting over 4 years. Primary outcomes were prevalence and causes of SCH, based on history, physical ocular and nonocular findings, and laboratory and imaging studies. Subconjunctival hemorrhage prevalence was determined including and excluding eye surgery to reduce bias in the prevalence estimate.

Results

We studied 33,990 children, who underwent 86,277 examinations (median age, 5 years; range, 2 days to 18 years; 9282 younger than 2 years, 13,447 age 2–7 years, 11,261 age 8–18 years). There were 949 cases of SCH (1.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–1.2). When surgery was excluded, there were 313 cases (prevalence, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.3–0.4), of which 261 (83%) were due to trauma; 40 (13%) ocular surface inflammation, including infectious conjunctivitis; 7 (2%) orbital or conjunctival lesion; 3 (1%) vessel rupture from choking or cough; and 2 (1%) coagulopathy related. Across all ages, including less than 2 years, trauma and inflammation together accounted for 94% to 97% of all cases of SCH.

Conclusions

Subconjunctival hemorrhage is uncommon in children. The great majority of cases are due to trauma. All children with SCH, including infants and young children, should be closely examined to identify other ocular or nonocular signs of trauma.

### Incidence of non-traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage in an Indian rural population [^116rXWv2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subconjunctival hemorrhage (SCH) is a benign condition of eyes characterized by the collection of blood in the subconjunctival space (Figure 1). It is commonly associated with acute redness of eyes and is painless without any signs of acute inflammation of conjunctiva. Red eye is of great concern to many patients for which they may seek medical advice. However, this condition does not require any treatment and subsides within 2–3 weeks.

Figure 1
Showing subconjunctival hemorrhage.

Broadly, SCH is classified into traumatic and non-traumatic. Local trauma is the most common cause of SCH. Spontaneous rupture of subconjunctival vessels leads to non-traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage (NTSH). Other non-traumatic causes include patients on anticoagulant therapy, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coagulopathies. However, a majority of these causes are idiopathic in nature.

In a large population-based survey by Hu et al on NTSH, the mean annual incidence quoted was 65 per 10,000 people. A literature search (10/10/2017) on MEDLINE revealed that the incidence of NTSH is not available for the Indian population. Therefore, we designed this study to determine the incidence of NTSH in the Indian rural population.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have had:

Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram
Diabetes
Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides
High blood pressure
Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Risk of developing blood clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. The risk of developing blood clots is not affected by how long you use the medicine. Serious blood clots can happen especially if you smoke, are obese, or are older than 35 years of age. Serious blood clots are more likely to happen when you:In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

### Indirect choroidal neovascularization secondary to a posterior-segment intraocular foreign body-case report [^1175KhL5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old male patient without a history of systemic diseases or myopia suffered from a fast-shot metallic IOFB in his right eye while working. He was sent to our emergency room, where a penetration wound with iris incarceration was located at the nasal lower cornea in his right eye. Under a slit lamp, he was found to have a diffuse, thin hyphema and some blood clots at the position of the distorted and torn pupil (Fig. 1 a). His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion at 30 cm in the right eye and 18/20 in the left eye.

Under a slit lamp, the patient was found to have a diffuse, thin hyphema and a blood clot at the position of the distorted and torn pupil (a). The metallic IOFB was approximately 8X4 mm in size (b). Orbital computed tomography (CT) without contrast enhancement showed the metallic IOFB floating in the vitreous cavity in different views, such as the horizontal (c), coronary (d) and sagittal (e) views

He underwent primary corneal repair, pars plana vitrectomy, IOFB removal and prophylactic IVI of antibiotics with vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 c.c.) and ceftazidime (2 mg/0.1 c.c.) at the end of surgery. At the beginning of vitrectomy, no retinal impact was noted. However, the IOFB dropped to the nasal and upper retinal area outside the macula while performing the vitrectomy to release vitreous traction around the IOFB. Two weeks later, his intraocular pressure in the right eye elevated abruptly to 30 mmHg with cell 3+ in the deep anterior chamber and a cloudy, swollen lens. Because of the suspicion of phacolytic glaucoma, he underwent cataract surgery. The BCVA in his right eye recovered to 20/20 5 months later, with good foveal contour except for a small retinal dimple (yellow arrow) and a segment of hyporeflectivity at the inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) junction (white arrow) of the temporal fovea (Fig. 3 a).

### Scleral structure, organisation and disease. A review [^114V3KPm]. Experimental Eye Research (2004). Low credibility.

Although disease of the sclera is unusual, when it occurs it can rapidly destroy both the eye and vision. However, normally the sclera provides an opaque protective coat for the intraocular tissues and a stable support during variations in internal pressure and eye movements, which would otherwise perturb the visual process through distortion of the retina and the lens/iris diaphragm. This stability, which is vital for clear vision is made possible by the organisation and viscoelastic properties of scleral connective tissue. Microscopically, the sclera displays distinct concentric layers including, from outside, Tenon's capsule, episclera, the scleral stroma proper and lamina fusca, melding into underlying choroid. Two sites exhibit specialised structure and function: the perilimbal trabecular meshwork, through which aqueous filters into Schlemm's canal, and the lamina cribrosa, which permits axons of the optic nerve to exit the posterior sclera. Throughout, sclera is densely collagenous, the stroma consisting of fibrils with various diameters combining into either interlacing fibre bundles or defined lamellae in outer zones. Scleral fibrils are heterotypic structures made of collagen types I and III, with small amounts of types V and VI also present. Scleral elastic fibres are especially abundant in lamina fusca and trabecular meshwork. The interfibrillar matrix is occupied by small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, containing dermatan and dermatan/chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycans, together with the large proteoglycan, aggrecan, which also carries keratan sulphate sidechains. Decorin is closely associated with the collagen fibrils at specific binding sites situated close to the C-terminus of the collagen molecules. Proteoglycans influence hydration, solute diffusion and fluid movement through the sclera, both from the uvea and via the trabecular meshwork. As the sclera is avascular, nutrients come from the choroid and vascular plexi in Tenon's capsule and episclera, where there is an artery to artery anastomosis in which blood oscillates, rather than flows rapidly. This predisposes to the development of vasculitis causing a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of varying intensity which, in the most severe form, necrotising scleritis, may destroy all of the structural and cellular components of the sclera. Scleral cells become fibroblastic and the stroma is infiltrated with inflammatory cells dominated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes. This process resembles, and may be concurrent with, systemic disease affecting other connective tissues, particularly the synovial joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Current views support an autoimmune aetiology for scleritis. Whilst the role of immune complexes and the nature of initial pro-inflammatory antigen(s) remain unknown, the latter may reside in scleral tissue components which are released or modified by viral infection, injury or surgical trauma.

What are the possible side effects of clopidogrel tablets?

Clopidogrel tablets can cause serious side effects including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about clopidogrel tablets?"
A blood clotting problem called Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). TTP can happen with clopidogrel tablets, sometimes after a short time (less than 2 weeks). TTP is a blood clotting problem where blood clots form in blood vessels; and can happen anywhere in the body. TTP needs to be treated in a hospital right away because it may cause death. Get medical help right away if you have any of these symptoms and they cannot be explained by another medical condition:
purplish spots (called purpura) on the skin or in the mouth (mucous membranes) due to bleeding under the skin
your skin or the whites of your eyes are yellow (jaundice)
you feel tired or weak
your skin looks very pale
fever
fast heart rate or feeling short of breath
headache
speech changes
confusion

### Outcomes in patients with suprachoroidal hemorrhage after anterior segment surgery [^116LNkZ9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) occurs when blood from the short or long ciliary arteries accumulates in the potential space between the choroid and sclera. It is usually precipitated by intraocular surgery or trauma. Mechanistically, SCH is theorized to occur in the setting of hypotony or sudden decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP), which leads to choroidal effusion, stretching of ciliary arteries, and then rupture of an artery with hemorrhage into the suprachoroidal space. Patients may present with symptoms of sudden onset severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased vision, as well as signs of anterior chamber shallowing with elevated IOP. Onset may be delayed after surgery, and atypical presentations, such as SCH mimicking a choroidal mass, have been reported.

The incidence of SCH differs depending on the type of ocular surgery. Glaucoma surgery has the highest incidence of SCH, ranging from 0.15 to 6.1%. The incidence of SCH secondary to cataract surgery has decreased to 0.03–0.06% with the adoption of phacoemulsification techniques, presumably due to better maintenance of intraoperative IOP. Risk factors for the development of SCH include advanced age, anticoagulation, uncontrolled hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, history of glaucoma, hypotony, high myopia, aphakia, previous intraocular surgery/trauma, elevated perioperative IOP, Valsalva maneuvers, and prolonged surgical time.

SCH can be classified in several ways: by etiology, extent of hemorrhage (ie in terms of quadrants), or by degree of elevation. Appositional or "kissing" SCH occurs when the degree of elevation of two opposing sides is so great that it causes inner retinal touch (Figure 1). Ultrasonography is helpful in identifying and defining the features of SCH; there is typically a dome-shaped elevation of the choroid filled with hyperechoic material, which becomes hypoechoic over time as the blood clot liquifies. Ultrasonography can thus also aid in determining the need for and optimal timing of surgical drainage (Figure 1A and B).

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines series for microPulse transscleral laser therapy-surgical technique, post-operative care, expected outcomes and retreatment / enhancements [^116G7y5S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Finding 4: Probe Positioning and Adjustment

This consensus panel places the limbal-matching curvature 'bunny ears' of the revised MicroPulse P3 probe on the limbus (Figure 1). If the limbus is not clearly defined, it is acceptable to err up to 1 mm posterior from this structure. When in doubt of the location of the ciliary body, such as in very high myopes or hyperopes, transillumination or UBM can be used to adjust probe positioning. (With the revised MicroPulse P3 probe, the actual laser fiber from where the laser light emanates is located 3.0 mm posterior to the center of the anterior edge of the probe in between the bunny ears.

Finding 5: Probe Sweeping

Most panel members make a sweep of 180 degrees, then reverse direction like a pendulum. The typical treatment pattern is to move the probe in a back-and-forth manner over the hemisphere. Treating by quadrant can also be done, according to the preference of the surgeon. Stopping and restarting during the treatment cycle is acceptable to optimize probe positioning.

Finding 6: Tissue Considerations

Surgeons should be careful not to traumatize areas of fragile tissue. One should not treat over thin, avascular areas of conjunctiva, including over blebs or tubes. However, the panel feels it is appropriate to treat over areas of prior surgery and scleral patches if the conjunctiva and sclera are normal in appearance and contour. This panel recommends sparing treatment over the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions and agrees that localized areas of scleral thinning should be spared. If areas are skipped, the same overall sweep time is maintained, and the probe is applied over a smaller area. Panelists avoid treating over a dense, elevated subconjunctival hemorrhage.

Finding 7: Vasoconstriction

Topical vasoconstrictors (eg, phenylephrine 5% or brimonidine 0.15% to 0.2%) can be considered if the surgeon desires to decrease the risk of subconjunctival heme and minimize the potential absorption of energy by superficial vessels. No adjustment in treatment technique or parameters is required for an eye that is very hyperemic prior to surgery. Application of a vasoconstrictor is appropriate if desired by the treating physician.

### Medical interventions for traumatic hyphema [^1123bJJj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic hyphema is the entry of blood into the anterior chamber (the space between the cornea and iris) subsequent to a blow or a projectile striking the eye. Hyphema uncommonly causes permanent loss of vision. Associated trauma (e.g. corneal staining, traumatic cataract, angle recession glaucoma, optic atrophy, etc.) may seriously affect vision. Such complications may lead to permanent impairment of vision. Patients with sickle cell trait/disease may be particularly susceptible to increases of elevated intraocular pressure. If rebleeding occurs, the rates and severity of complications increase.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of various medical interventions in the management of traumatic hyphema.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 30 August 2013.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by the electronic and manual searches. In this review, we included randomized and quasi-randomized trials that compared various medical interventions versus other medical interventions or control groups for the treatment of traumatic hyphema following closed globe trauma. We applied no restrictions regarding age, gender, severity of the closed globe trauma, or level of visual acuity at the time of enrolment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data for the primary and secondary outcomes. We entered and analyzed data using Review Manager 5. We performed meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model and reported dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios and continuous outcomes as mean differences.

Main Results

We included 20 randomized and seven quasi-randomized studies with 2643 participants in this review. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (oral and systemic aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. No intervention had a significant effect on visual acuity whether measured at two weeks or less after the trauma or at longer time periods. The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of aminocaproic acid compared with no use, but was not altered by any other intervention. Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.57), but a sensitivity analysis omitting studies not using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.09). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10). We found tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49), as did aminomethylbenzoic acid as reported in one study (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32). The evidence to support an associated reduction in the risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e. corneal bloodstaining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compared with placebo. We found no difference in the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose. The available evidence on usage of corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials. We found no difference in effect between a single versus binocular patch or ambulation versus complete bed rest on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed.

Authors' Conclusions

Traumatic hyphema in the absence of other intraocular injuries uncommonly leads to permanent loss of vision. Complications resulting from secondary hemorrhage could lead to permanent impairment of vision, especially in patients with sickle cell trait/disease. We found no evidence to show an effect on visual acuity by any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although evidence was limited, it appears that patients with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhaging. However, hyphema in patients treated with aminocaproic acid take longer to clear. Other than the possible benefits of antifibrinolytic usage to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage, the decision to use corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or nondrug interventions (such as binocular patching, bed rest, or head elevation) should remain individualized because no solid scientific evidence supports a benefit. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value.

### Appearance of retinal arterial macroaneurysms in patients using swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography [^11216hNS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

RAMs are commonly found at the weaker parts of the arterial walls, such as arteriovenous junctions without adventitial layers and the arteries that are subjected to lipid plaque deposition that destroys the vessel structures. Pathological structural manifestations are prone to emerge due to the inability to maintain their original structures and the decreasing tolerance to pressure. Simultaneously, increased or fluctuating blood flow exerts more uneven pressure on the lesions, so RAMs present as fusiform and saccular. When blood pressure fluctuates greatly or increases suddenly, a hemangioma is likely to rupture. The energy trapped in the lumen pushes blood toward all layers of the retina, and this accounts for the diversity in the clinical manifestations of RAMs. Some patients continue to produce exudate without bleeding due to an increased vascular endothelial cell space. Such exudation relieves the pressure inside the macroaneurysm and thus reduces the risk of rupture and hemorrhage. However, active exudation also threatens the visual function of patients and requires active treatment. In some patients with macroaneurysm rupture, hemostasis by compression occurs due to the blood flowing out of the ruptured vessel, and the hemostasis mechanism, including vasoconstriction and the formation of a clot, is initiated. However, whether the clot can seal up the vessel rupture and fill the lumen to keep the lesion in a static state needs to be examined with angiography and SS-OCTA, which are in favor of instituting therapeutic schedules.

### Retinal artery occlusion associated with prepapillary arterial loop: an isolated ocular disease? Case report and literature review [^115ydnDz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Generally, patients with branch retinal artery occlusion need an urgent stroke workup. However in the case of prepapillary arterial loop, as in both this case report and literature review attest to, there is no need for systemic workup. Occlusion in this entity is intrinsic to the loop physiology and pathology. Pathologically, prepapillary vascular loop does not have an internal elastic lamina and is supported by a connective tissue sheath lined by a cellular lamina. This weakened vessel wall is hence more prone to vasoocclusion. Physiologically, it is known that twisted vessels are more prone to occlusion with several cases of twisted cerebrovascular vessels reported to lead to occlusion of blood flow. Prepapillary loops, and more so the coil-like structures, appear to alter the hemodynamics and increase the risk of thromboembolic events due to turbulent blood flow. Prepapillary loops can assume several shapes: figure of eight, corkscrew, or hairpin turn. It seems that the torsional forces accompanied by turbulence lead to twisting and strangulation of the loop. Hemodynamic turbulence inside the loop results in endothelial damage with secondary intraarterial clot. Occasionally there is vitreous traction on the loop. There is no known association between prepapillary capillary loops and specific systemic illness.

Retinal vein occlusion is a common and important cause of vision loss. In general, knowledge about this condition is scant within an internist's practice but the condition is relevant because of its association with other chronic ailments. A diagnosis of RVO should prompt the investigation of conditions needing chronic management in these patients. In this review we summarize the clinical presentation of RVO, its classification, associated risk factors, and treatment focused in the internist's scope of practice.

### Risk factors for severe bleeding complications in glaucoma surgery and the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents [^115tX9Gr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Our aim was to establish a uniform grading system for intraoperative bleeding events and then to apply this grading system to evaluate the influence of various factors such as AP and/ or AC agents only on clinically relevant, severe (grade 3 or higher) bleeding events. As in our parallel study of retinal patients, this grading revealed rather few patients suffering a severe intraoperative hemorrhage. Our ability to statistically claim an increased risk for a severe bleeding event due to AP and/ or AC agents is thus limited. However, to strengthen the evidence of this study's results, a prospective, randomized, blinded (ideally a multicenter) study would be desirable involving a larger study population to account for the few severe bleeding events, and with a blinded bleeding severity grading setup. In such a trial, the individual effect of AP/AC medication and especially novel oral anticoagulative agents and laboratory parameters such as INR or aPTT could be analyzed, as Dayani and coworkers did, as they demonstrated a higher risk of bleeding in patients with higher INR values. In addition, it could then be investigated whether increased conjunctival hyperemia due to the use of pressure-lowering eye drops influences the risk of severe intraoperative bleeding events.

### Current pattern of ocular trauma as seen in tertiary institutions in south-eastern Nigeria [^112et16W]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ocular trauma is an important cause of visual impairment and a leading cause of preventable monocular blindness. Worldwide, there are approximately 1.6 million people blind from eye injuries, an additional 2.3 million people with bilateral low vision from this cause and almost 19 million with unilateral blindness or low vision.

In developing countries, eye injuries are not only more common but also more severe in their effect and this may be attributed to socioeconomic background, inadequate safety measures, lack of optimum treatment facilities, use of traditional eye medication and poor education. Studies from Nigeria and other parts of Africa have reported ocular trauma as an important cause of monocular blindness.

The spectrum of ocular injuries ranges from the very mild non-sight threatening to extremely serious with potentially blinding consequences. Based on the more comprehensive Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology system (BETTS), recent studies have classified open-globe injury types as rupture, penetrating, intraocular foreign body, perforating and mixed; closed-globe injury types, as contusion, lamellar laceration, superficial foreign body and mixed. The rationale for classifying ocular trauma is to determine and document severity of injury. It also provides a standardized description and terminology for the injury, which is internationally accepted and understood. The type and extent of damage sustained by a traumatised eye depends on both the mechanism and force of the trauma. Common consequences of ocular blunt trauma include periocular lid ecchymosis/ haematoma, orbital fractures, subconjunctival haemorrhage, corneal abrasions/ulcers, hyphaema, cataracts, lens dislocation/ subluxation, contusions, retinal detachments and globe rupture. Penetrating/ perforating injury could lead to lacerations of the eyelids, cornea or sclera which may be associated with intraocular haemorrhage, retained foreign bodies or tractional retinal detachment.
